    "The course project is based on the [Home Credit Default Risk (HCDR)  Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/). The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. In order to make sure that people who struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories have a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\n",

    "* Summarizing transaction data\n",
    "* Merging of the aggregated data\n",

    "## Back ground Home Credit Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home Credit Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background on the dataset\n",
    "Home Credit is a non-banking financial institution, founded in 1997 in the Czech Republic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company operates in 14 countries (including United States, Russia, Kazahstan, Belarus, China, India) and focuses on lending primarily to people with little or no credit history which will either not obtain loans or became victims of untrustworthly lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit group has over 29 million customers, total assests of 21 billions Euro, over 160 millions loans, with the majority in Asia and and almost half of them in China (as of 19-05-2018).\n",

Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data files overview\n",
    "There are 7 different sources of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __application_train/application_test:__ the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_CURR. The training application data comes with the TARGET indicating __0: the loan was repaid__ or __1: the loan was not repaid__. The target variable defines if the client had payment difficulties meaning he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan. Such case is marked as 1 while other all other cases as 0.\n",
    "* __bureau:__ data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n",
    "* __bureau_balance:__ monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length.\n",
    "* __previous_application:__ previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_PREV.\n",
    "* __POS_CASH_BALANCE:__ monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n",
    "* __credit_card_balance:__ monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n",
    "* __installments_payment:__ payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment."

    "For this phase of the project, you will need to submit a write-up summarizing the work you did. \n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "Home Credit is a non-banking financial institution that uses sources like transactional data and telecom data, to get insights into the applicant’s finances and determine their repayment capabilities and accordingly help them to obtain loans. These insights are to answer the biggest question the company has, will the applicant be able to repay the loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "We were required to understand the dataset, extract relevant features, perform experiments using various machine learning algorithms and determine the best performing parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did EDA, visualize the data for better presentation, find the correlation between the various data elements, create new features from existing data, rollup and aggregate wherever necessary. All this was done using pipelines so that our solutions remain clean and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a subset of available features, extracted additional features and ran through the models comprising Logistic Regression, XGABoost and LightGBM. We got the best Kaggle score of .767.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit share the data in 7 different files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __application_train/application_test:__ the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_CURR. The training application data comes with the TARGET indicating __0: the loan was repaid__ or __1: the loan was not repaid__. The target variable defines if the client had payment difficulties meaning he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan. Such case is marked as 1 while other all other cases as 0.\n",
    "* __bureau:__ data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n",
    "* __bureau_balance:__ monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length.\n",
    "* __previous_application:__ previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_PREV.\n",
    "* __POS_CASH_BALANCE:__ monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n",
    "* __credit_card_balance:__ monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n",
    "* __installments_payment:__ payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment.\n",

    "We created custom transformers for each of the datasets. There are Feature Aggregators, One Hot Encoders and Column Encoders depending on the need of the data. Once we had merged the data we had 200+ features. With experiments we were able to determine what features didnt help and we dropped those features. Below are the snapshots of some new features extracted from the Application data set and the transformer for the Bureau data:\n",

The merge pipeline is invoked for both Test ad Train sets to make sure that same processing steps are applied on both the data sets.\n",
