1,spot for an even or a quite cocktail  they were swell to host the yelp crew with a great drink menu and super attentive staffi'd certainly recommend anything with the purred fruit in it (apple any of them really)
1,love love the calamari it's so good and spicy there is an endless list of martinis and one is better than the next there is a first and second floor if you prefer more of a bar or lounge atmosphere it's not a place i like for dinner but for drinks and apps it's wonderful
1,this place stiff martinis and cocktails cheap drinks good service nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends classy crowd and much more mature older and professional crowd there aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there which is so great very nice place to wind down after a long day
1,everything a great cocktail bar should be  great location ambiance cocktails and chill environment**disclaimer:   5 stars doesn't have to mean it's new york city good it is a simple place and it's not flashy by any means   i'd take a girl for the beginning of a date or on the opposite end of the spectrum talking business with colleagues
1,came here before a pirates game so it was around 5:30ish or so in the evening we had just gotten lucky that they had a table open before all there reservations for the night started to come in  i ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad absolutely loved it  the chicken had the perfect amount of spice to it which was off set with sweet with the pineapple chutney it had on it sooo good  the salad was even great because they used real green spring mix instead of iceburg lettuce  i also loved that they put feta cheese on top its one of my favorite cheeses for salad topping  service was great here and even though i didn't have a drink here that night i have a previous time and they are yummy  love this place and can't wait for my next visit
1,or twist is the historic site of my very first martini when i turned 21 many years ago  it's been a long happy unionwhile olive or twist is not a five star restaurant it gets 5 stars from me because i love it  its one of the few places i know of that has been consistantly good  for years  the interior is warm and a little bit industrial  the downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nicethe drinks are great although the first martini i ever had (a girl doesn't forget  [wellthis one didn't]) was a pineapple upside down martini and i don't think they offer that anymore but they do have a very expansive martini menu  i tried the chipotle martini and it was so excellent that when i took my first sip i sighed in a way my bf turned to me and sarcastically said "oh you're going to be yelping about that aren't you"  then i refused to let him even try it bc it was that good  it was minei also had a cake batter martini which tasted great and came out looking so pretty i instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends clicked like on it and my one aunt commented i should drink less  whatever she needs a martinithe service was great  our waitress lauren was really cool and very good at recommending the drinks--the chipotle martini was her recommendation i would never had ordered that on my ownwe had the buffalo chicken dip which was served in a martini glass and it was really goodmy favorite thing on the menu there is the tomato basil bisque soup and it has been rocking my lunch hour for the past ten years  it's delicious  its so good that lauren and i actually high fived when she brought it out  (true story)my bf had the chicken caprese wrap and said it was excellent it was gone within minutes so that is a good signi highly recommend this place for lunch after dinner cocktails or a date  this is one of my favorite downtown lunch spots
1,beautiful little bar with an exciting "martini" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks
1,favorite bar in town love the live music and the martinis - fave is the strawberry shortcake
1,location is in a strip mall but this place is a diamond in the rough  the food was some of the best italian food i have had anywhere  i live in kansas city which has a pretty large and long standing italian populaiton  the food is a good as any of the old italian places in kc  everyone in my group was amazed at the quality of the food for the price  i will keep this one on my list of places to come back to when i am in az again
1,place is openthe best food and the best service try the butter nut squash ravioli  fantastic
1,can't say enough good things about this place the owner and wait staff were genuinely friendly and the food was great i had the veal caprese and my wife had the canolone  both were exceptional and reasonably priced  unlike the chain italian restaurants the portions were reasonable instead of super-sized  we were full but not stuffed when we finished  we also brought our fourteen month old along  they don't have a kids menu so i can't call the restaurant "family friendly" but everyone was really friendly to our family the owner even stopped by once or twice to pinch our son's cheeks  we live near by and are considering becoming regulars here
1,husband and i want to give six stars  we've driven by this place for a year and always talked about going inso sorry we waited so long  very pretty little place  the service was great and very warm  i had the butternut squash ravioli and in was in heaven for every single bite  we will be back often and plan to take my daughter next time  i don't think they have a kid's menu but our server said they could do spaghetti and meatballs or fettucine with chicken  perfect  thank you jennifer  we loved it  )
1,still laughing reading poor maribeth's review below; i think maybe her ex did pay someone to play an awful joke on her  like drugging her and taking her to wendy's and telling her she was at salute  this place is the best little neighborhood secret ever and i only hope everyone reads and believes maribeth's review so i can still get a table on friday nights without making a reservation
1,husband and i have been here several times both for large functions and on our own  what we always notice is how attentive the wait staff is  and they really seem to care about our dining experience  of the appetizers we love the antipasto stuff mushrooms and seafood salad  the butternut squash ravioli is awesome as is everything we've tried  the strip mall location isn't particularly appealing but the good food and excellent service will keep us coming back
1,very good top notch calamari and scampi appetizers excellent garlic breadentrees were eggplant parm- great; lasagna- excellent; orange roughy with capers and artichokes-amazing and cheese tortellini with 4 cheese sauce- also greatperfect service- a really on the ball waiter close to hilton tapatio  cliffs toocozy place nicely lit made you forget about the strip mall locale
1,night at salutes is a real treat  the live jazz duo sings quietly and adds to the ambience of this local gem  the staff is always friendly and makes some reference to your last trip which makes you feel special  and speaking of specialtheir chicken florentine special was mouth-watering  i'm sure the bottle of chianti helpedbut just loved the experience
1,with family last nightloved it our server julie was excellent- extremely friendly and attentive to our table the stuffed mushroom and shrimp scampi appetizers were deliciousexcellent for dipping the really good garlic bread in the sauces :) my daughter said that the fettuccine alfredo (not on the menu but offered) was the best she's ever tasted the butternut squash ravioli was very rich (almost too rich) but quite tasty the guys both got the crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli with walnut cream sauce (not on the regular menu)- both loved it  it's a really great place for a special date or a quaint dinner with friends
1,been waiting to change from four stars to five and tonights dining experience did it  the staff always makes us feel like one of their family and tonight was no different  my eggplant parmesan was mouth-watering accompanied with their house chianti  friday night live jazz always a pleasure  thanks julie for noticing my hairyours was adorable as well  btwthe place was packedyou may need a reservation
1,is the best bartender i hope that when i grow up one day i can be just like him when he tells stories they're so amazing you'll want to hear them twice ;)
1,this bar great affordable food awesome gambling promotions free slot tournament on sat night at 7 bartenders are the best
1,was my favorite spot to drink whilst on vacation we ordered a pizza and i don't remember what my bf ordered a burger i think our pizza was really good i think it had jalepenos and sausage and maybe extra cheese it was like $7 had two drinks while we sat and enjoyed the company the bartender was so sweet and friendly they have a daily contest where you can win cash money if you come a few days a month and gamble there it wouldn't work if you don't live there so i tuned out on the details i don't know why we even bother with the strip get off the strip people see the real vegas leftovers were yummy the next morning cold or warmed it's a dive but a good one
1,i lived in vegas i was right behind the place i was coming home from a mid week bender in the strip didn't feel like going home and i was all jacked up on vodkared bull and hungry i stopped in here cuz i hadn't checked it out met someone right away from the chicago burbs bartender was a cool guy had a pizza and i'm from chicago so i'm a pizza snob i was kinda drunk but that fawker tasted great had a beer or two then stumbled home and passed out
1,take clients to clubs for lunch when i am in charlotte on business i travel all over and was not expecting much in charlotte i had gone to one uptown club a few times and it was nice  i went to a friday lunch special at the men's club from a hotel referral it is remarkably nice inside good staff good music and a better menu than the hotel i was staying in it was something i would have expected in las vegas not charlotte i will go back every time i am in town
1,is by far the best strip club in charlotte i come here on wednesdays for the lunch buffet during the day which is always a steal for 10$ all you can eat plus admission into the club otherwise i usually come on friday or saturday night when its packed with girls the seating is comfortable and 1 large stage and three mini side stages girls are friendly and most are above a 7 dances are 20$ and worth every penny my favorite there is bianca who is amazing in vip
1,the place very friendly staff and definitely the hottest girls in town nonpushy girls which is a big plus very classy and clean definitely not your typical strip club the food is very good and reasonably priced check it out you won't be sorry
1,only does this club have gorgeous entertainers on point service from bartenders and waitresses and an upscale environment but the food is absolutely amazing  they just added a ton of new items to their menu  i highly recommended the bison cheddar meatloaf and the bone in pork chop topped with crawfish  they have some great specialty cocktails with catchy names like the wet panty and carmel apple tittaythis is not your typical strip club  everyone here is very polite (you won't get hounded for a dance the second you sit down)  the environment is very nice classy and clean  their vip area upstairs is top notch and always a great time  make sure to check out the bar at the top of the stairs which is open to the public  the view from upstairs is awesome because you can see the whole clubtheir breakfast buffet is also a great end to a friday or saturday night so check it out 2am to 3:30am on those days
1,food and atmosphere  very upscale and friendly  favorite is the kick-ass filet for dinner  great lunch specials too
1,is by far the nicest place in charlotte to go as far as a men's club they have a nice breakfast which is actually pretty good after 2 am the girls for the majority are good looking the ambiance is very nice and the complimentary valet is nice i def recommend this place
1,a group of my good friends over for a bachelorette party and we had an amazing time the bartender leah was on point all night and kept us having an amazing time will definately be bak a lot more thank youdj evo
1,came to the men's club of charlotte with dj evo and some friends we had a great time leah was our bartender she was excellent and helpful with recommending some great drinks had a great time
1,smoking (when i'm looking for it) is totally awesomewe came in here one night after an already long night of drinking  the place was quiet but the bar was incredibly well stocked they allowed indoor smoking and sold a range of cigars  what's not to love rightwe closed the place down at some point we ordered a delivery pizza  the bartender was a ton of fun told great stories fed the jukebox with great songs (and let us pick about half of them) and really kept us going  the prices were really reasonable on drinks and we all had (too much of) a good time  several tvs had football on (without sound) and the bathroom was extremely clean  really what more do you need in a barif i had to critique one thing though it would be the cigar brands  i think i only noticed one or two but none of them were names i recognized
1,new management humidors are fully stocked drinks are delicious and there is regular music the new owners are wonderfully gracious hosts and each time i go i meet a new friend best newold fitchburg hangout
1,hired a new bartender it was his first night on sat if i remember correctly i think his name is david gosh i'm probably totally wrong thoughanyway he's tended at a couple different places he made 1 damn good jamaican 10 speed i dislike malibu so i asked for parrot bay delicious i hope he sticks around for a whilethere was a late last call on sat too they were still serving right up till 2 they pretty much called last call at 1:50 so i think we got out of there around 2:15oh & i finally spotted the juke box i've walked right past it quite a few times i think when i look around for the juke box i picture the ones from the 50-70's or so i'm looking for big tall brightly lit & maybe orange or yellow colored i'm so spastic sometimes lolrestroom light was on again too :)come any day of the week it's always fun here
1,the wings ask for honey bbq they are the best
1,cool divey casinobar with some of the friendliest people in vegas working there  been coming here for years and i never get tired of it  you get mardi gras beads as you walk in and immediately after someone is there to get you a drink  a couple of minutes later you are gaming drinking and having a great time and occasionally you really do win money and i mean real money no tickets here so don't put a hundred in and then try to cash out you'll be so loaded down with nickels and quarters you won't be able to walkthe drinks are strong the slots are decently loose and the manager barbara and the cashier mary ellen are so cool make you feel so welcome  the russian cocktail waitress is really nice too and trust me she'll be back to check on your drink before you can sip down the one you havethis is one thing i miss about vegas the free drinks to keep you there  most places don't give them away unless you're at a $1 machine and even then not usually  so la bayou has my business two times a year every year  keep up the good work everyone at la bayou
1,well the slot machines i love this place their machines pay out coins you can put coins in them as well i love the sound of cashing out and hearing the coins they have raffles every half houri always have a great time here
1,giving this place 5 stars because i've got a long story behind it  to make it short the yard long frozen drinks with the extra shot for a dollar caused me to get married on the fly and actually the second one i had a well-poured extra shot of bacardi 151 almost filled up the entire bowl in the bottom of the yard long  the county almost wouldn't give us a marriage license  but that was nearly 7 years ago and eveyrthing has worked out really well  i do remember the place being very fun and crazy for a "shotgun" dive casino  we'll go back next time we're in vegas not only for the memories but alos because it was just plain fun here
1,absolutely love this place this has become our "meetup" spot downtown it's a fun little dive they give out beads and have raffles they sell cool beads in the back and make awesome huge drinks in yards and footballs they also have some old slots that you can't find very often and the slots are fairly loose we always win a bit of cash there a small downside is that the slots are old school without tickets they drop a ton of nickels if you win it's minor though and actually kind of funit's not fancy it's just fun go
1,love this place the machines are fun and the coin aspect is a nice perk the cocktail server is awesome they are super quick and attentive i always tip them well you should too you won't regret it
1,fun on fremont i've had the best luck with pay out at these machines the wait staff is usually great and you never have an empty or even near empty drink the frozen drinks are fantastic and usually whoever is working back there knows their mixes and always creates something you'll enjoy highly recommend
1,does not pretend to be anything more than what it is the back bar is where its at huge strong drink for 16 dollars with a shot of ever clear for an extra 3 worked like a charm and they pay in coins brilliant
1,came to town on valentine's day to celebrate my youngest son's 21st b-day (yes it's on v-day)  sadly the drive from la was more hellish than usual and we got to our condo so late that we skipped out on driving to fremont  (however we did find ellis island nearby and enjoyed that for what it is see my review)i really wanted to make sure my sons went down to fremont where i knew we'd end up in bayou so we came sunday after breakfast (omelette house- divine)   i've been here before (of course back in 2001 i think the daiquiris were about 13 the price)  i really don't enjoy gambling but i do like to sit at a real coin-op slot machine and pull the arm of the one-armed bandit with my own hand  there is something very satisfying about plunking coins in and hearing your winnings clink into the tray  a classic vegas experience that is hard to come-by today i truly hope they never get rid of those machines  it's a friendly place and a must-visit stop on fremont  we had a blast and were only sorry that we couldn't come at night and get they whole "experience"   we will be back*note to self:  the drinks are stronger than they look  we got the hurricane white russian and mud slide flavors and enjoyed them all  i think i liked my son's white russian best because it tasted like vanilla ice cream  yum
1,still as divey as ever here at la bayou casino  it's run down cramped and there's dusty stuff all over the walls and ceilings  god knows i love this place  it's one of the coolest places in downtown vegas and they always get my businessfrom the time you walk in the door and get your beads and raffle ticket till the time you leave it's non-stop free drinks cool employees and loose slotsyou know how most casinos only offer you free drinks when you are playing the $1 slots or better  not here  i walked up got some mardi gras beads and before i could sit down they asked me what i wanted to drink  i hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink  these ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth  by the way these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcoholtheir slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually)  the machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or tv shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big winlike i said before i'm still loving barbara (manager) and mary ellen (cashier)  they are part of the experience and if they ever leave the place just won't be the sameman i want to go back there right now
1,you are in vegas you must come herethis was one of the highlights of my recent trip to vegas la bayou offers real nickel slots frozen daiquiris free drinks (if you are gambling but it's nickel slots) and a dive-bar atmosphere upon arriving you are greeted by two ladies dresses in traditional vegas show girl feathers who hand out beads to customers the beads really add to the kitsch environment of fremont street and la bayou you are also handed a lottery ticket to enter to win up to $10000 which was another source of free entertainment the machines themselves work very well and it was so much fun playing actual coins and seeing them clink into the coin return tray the waitresses were very attentive and friendly( remember to tip) i never had to worry about asking for another drink and the drinks were strong la bayou is a great time for the non-serious gambler who wants to enjoy their time in vegas with cheesy promotions strong drinks and a taste of whats left of old school vegas it's just a good time all around
1,bad food but this place isn't really a "restaurant" as much as it is one of the best drinking holes in las vegas with a slick interior done up with tasteful neon and big televisions a square bar and one of the sexiest staffs in town food is pretty good too but excessive drinking may give a slanted opinion on that one
1,really expected this place to be a disgusting grimy dive i was shocked to discover a clean comfortable and beautifully decorated bar and restaurant we ordered the gyro sliders feta fries and artichoke dip; all were delicious beers were only $4 which is an amazing deal in this town we signed up for the ladies' club and saved 25% on our bill this place could easily become my new favorite bar
1,were looking for a place to watch the superbowl in vegas and lucked into this gem there was no cover charge and we had the best seat in the house service was excellent our waitress was brittany and she was so on top of it the food is very good too had the pizza and wing special tasty and very inexpensive also had buckets of beer would definitely come again
1,this place  if you are looking for a good bar pretty ladies and great food  you have found it  we reserved a couch for the sb this year and the service was over the top  my drink was never dry and the food was perfect the servers were delightful engaging and wore revealing but not too revealing outfitsi know it may look sketchy from the outside but highly recommended
1,is my local hang out when i come through vegasgreat food great staff good drink prices and the staff is awesometrish is great
1,crapy outside but this place rocks   killer food and a very nice staff  eat there  asian ahi salad   the bomb
1,you come to vegas and you want really really expensive vodka you will end up here unless you were completely mis-informed if you really want to impress the vodka-lover you brought along then you better come here also its in the mandalay hotel and casino which is one of the better places to rest your feet in las vegas
1,word: chernobyl   start your night with this cocktail  whether you have to beg borrow or video poker your way to the bargain $12 that this thing costsdo it  if you like vodka (in my case love vodka) or even if you don't this is the cocktail to end all cocktails it's got something close to 5 shots in it plus a float of stoli elite (5 different kinds of vodka)  but it gets betterthe drink doesn't taste like vodka  it tastes like a delectable cranberrylimefizzy thing that won't give you so much as a buzz  it comes with a mutant-looking candie cinnimon stick that's a great touch  well worth it  it's a vegas must-have  other than the drink the bar is nifty- great decor (former ussr the out-front statues head inside the frezzer and bartops of ice)  food is great but expensive the other drinks are great tooand i think they're fairly priced for the selection of vodkas strength of drink and originality
1,friends and i had a real good time here if you like expensive vodka then this is your place but to attain the ultimate experience is to purchase a bottle of vodka and drink it in the vodka freezer  you get to put on russain types of winter coats and drink off of a bar made of ice dean cain and the guy that owns the ivanko barbellcompany have a vodka locker there  the manager of the place is so cool that in addition to the bottle that my friends and i had he also let us taste other vodkas that they had available   i was in pure vodka heaven
1,is definitely the star here every martini i have tried here is fabulous  we went once when it wasn't particularly crowded at the ice bar and our bartender put on a great show of serving our martinis even though we had all ordered something different
1,
1,to be outdone is the food their lobster salad is definitely one of my favorites on the menu  a little pricey perhaps but well worth it
1,think everybody looks good in a red room so fun fugly folk like to hang here  and i'm ok with thatdon't bother coming here to dine (honestly i don't know why they even bother) but do come to swill  lots and lots of tasty boozy concoctions (it certainly helps that i looooove vodka) to enjoy  and an ice bar  imagine a drunken striptease on that  super sexy one moment catastrophic the next
1,k dave h and myself wandered around mandalay looking for any bar to be open at 3:30 in the afternoon  we stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded lenin signaling the entrance to the red square which didn't open until 4 pm  once 4 arrived we were the first to walk into the bar that day taking seats at the bar which is made out of ice  since this is a russian-themed bar they stock a wide assortment of vodkas  on their menu they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks  we decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others  since there were only a few other patrons we learned about the history of the place  when the bar first opened the bar generated a lot of controversy with the russian community because of the statute of lenin -- head attached -- and the perceived romantacizing of communism  the bar caved -- or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy -- and decided to behead lenin in a public ceremony  the head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker a walk-in sub-zero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients; it's so cold that before you enter you need to don a thick russian like fur coat and hat  we toured the locker knocked back a shot of vodka and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker  for several thousand dollars a year one can rent a space store any vodka you please have a name plate and enter the locker any time you please  not a bad deal if split among the three of uswe continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu  we looked around  just as we entered the bar as their first patrons we exited as their last  it was 4 am
1,from russia with love-the ice bar is beautiful and the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff will help you negotiate through the endless varieties of  uh   wait oh yeah vodka  i recommend getting some flights and splitting them with friends vodka has as many genres as wine and each is a brilliant ice cold experience   gotta love those ruskiesi also have to admit that they have a beautiful logo and the t-shirt is top notch
1,honest to gawd vodka bar with an bar made of ice and lenin's head in the top shelf  how can this place be less than 6 starsi love going to vegas if nothing than getting blind drunk on potato booze  the place is always packed and the staff is fast and drinks are the stuff legendary nights start with a liberal dose of  i would not live in vegas simply because of this place  i'd nevereverleave
1,tasty easily some of the best mixed drinks that i've ever had the pleasure of downingi started off with a chocolate martini from the dessert menu since their kitchen was closed and i still needed something sweet to finish off dinner it was smooth without being overly cloying or creamy very drinkable and deliciously chocolatey they even floated a white chocolate red square in the drink nice touch i'm a lightweight so that one martini was enough for me but i did get to try some of my friends' drinks the chernobyl will knock you on your butt if you aren't careful but it tastes like a yummy barely alcoholic fruit drink you won't know what hit you until it's too late they also have an outstanding black cherry vodkapinot noir martini that is really unique i can't remember the name of it but it's worth scouring the menu for the decor is elegant but cheesy and the booths are the best spot to sit and people watch we were there from about 1:30am-2:30am on a friday night and it was easy to grab some good seats and it was easy to chat without having to shout
1,love this swanky joint  if you are a vodka connoisseur andor like to try new or rare vodkas you will be in heaven  its a vodka bar in mandalay bay with so many brands and styles of vodka to choose from your head will be spinning  i'm a gibson fan (vodka martini w onion) so i asked the bartender what brand he recommended for a his favorite vodka martini served up  i was introduced to zyr (still not available in california) and this has since been my favorite brand its filtered 9 times and distilled 5 times and it is smooth as water  you can find distributors selling this on the internet - i've been getting it shipped to my house ever since my last vegas trip  :)  i'm heading out there again this weekend and will definitely make a stop into this place  food and apps are tasty nice presentation pricey (then again everything in vegas is a bit pricey)decor is very cool with an overwhelming "red" theme and the top of the bar is actually made out of 1 huge ice block  so if you set a drink on it it'll frost up and stay cold  they have quite an extensive original martini list most of them fruity  they allow you to head back into the walk-in freezer with a fur coat if you are into that  overall great spot  love hitting this place up in the early evening
1,know playboy club has it's own reviews moon i also went to for a play date coming upstairs to walk into the medley of lights and fiber optics was simply amazing it was more of an upscale version of rain it has a beautiful view of the vegas skyline what got to me was the floors being lit up the tables are metal with a mirrored finish it kinda made me feel like a pervert watching girls dance on itbut who cares the dance floor is huge and the patio area is just amazing moon's roof has a huge video screen kinda like the fremont st experience but this roof is supposed to retract that night it didn't due to the slight sprinkling moon also has a second floor with another bar and another patio access i had a great time there but this is one of those places you probably want to get a table for music was great - laser and light show was pretty off the hook sound system very loud what more can you expect from a monster club
1,is a bonifide vegas club  moon is located at the top of one of the palms towers so the views are spectacular from the balcony to the restroom  yes there's a floor-to-ceiling glass in the men's room  and a urinal right next to it that makes it the one of the most breathtaking p$$ spots in the world  the club is also connected to the high-roller playboy casino lounge where you can celebrity hunt  the drinks are as stiff as the prices so bring lots of cash and drink heavily before you arrive  the security staff was very courteous and helpfuljust be sure you arrive early as in right after dinner otherwise you'll be spending a lot of time in line downstairs and you might not get in at all  once you're in you're in  vegas style baby
1,clubi loved my night at moonwe did bottle servicevip here and it was well worth the cost  well okay - so we did bottle service for the boys and for the girls - we got ourselves in but it took all of 15 seconds   the management bouncers and serversbusboys were all fabulous  excellent service all around i'd give it 10 stars if i could   every single person working at moon that i had to deal with or talk to on this night was nothing short of stellar and the treatment they gave us was  first-class all around  the way they had us enter was straight through the playboy lounge and what i saw of that place i was not impressed  head up the escalators to moon and then voila - - - your night begins and all of moon is conducive to having a good time  we ended up getting a table in a separate vip lounge area a good distance away from the dancefloor which made it possible to talk as well as drink in private  there are booths everywhere - and all of  them were nicely set up and comfortable well-placed etc  but i never like sitting too close to the dancefloor where people are falling into your table or you can't even hear yourself think so this was perfect  when you opt for bottle service at moon the service leaves you wanting for nothing nothing at all  to make a reservation there is a form to fill out and you do have to hold with your cc unless they know you  it was relatively easy and even those in our party who were late got in without a glitch just by mentioning the name under which i'd made reservations  very smooth processgreat music great crowd and a gorgeous club to boot  the patio area outside was fabulous - - view of the whole city and lots of perfect photo opps out there  take a drink outside and get your groove going come inside and dance the night away  i would not have minded having a table outside reserved and might do that the next time i am in vegasthree bottles later - - we were all nicely toasted and i think everyone could agree that it was a great time  fyi:  don't pass out  if you pass out cold in a drunken stupor - they will ask that you be escorted out  one of my friends had just this happen to him and when i came back from dancing - - he was gone  hahahahai'd go back to moon at any time without any hesitation  great club and perhaps one of the best in vegas at this time  go go go
1,club  loved it absolutely loved it  maybe it was the fact that the bachelorette party i was in tacked on to a really cute set of bachelors at a bachelor party there and had a bottle service and therefore a table and therefore a place to sit but this club was great  fabulous music and a great dance floor  the gogo dancers were awesome (not like some places where you look at the gogo dancer go and you cannot help but think to yourself  hey i could do a better job)  and the bar tenders were seriously on top of there stuff  fabulous  great people at this place and girls the best thing the line at the bathroom moved quickly and there was practically no wait  fantastic  oh and another thing for all of you out there  i totally danced to my hearts content and talked to fantastically cute boys  (for those who might be getting worried that i was never going to find a date yet vegas might not count but still i had a great time)  the grey goose apple martini was to die for and figi water was what you could buy at the bar  check it out for sure if you can
1,club was great so great in fact that i danced so much i thought my feet were going to have to be amputated the music was fantastic we were put on some kind of list and immediately sent to the front of the line to be escorted right in not sure how that happened but given the line we by-passed thank you plus someone gave us a drink while we waited for the elevator thank you
1,places like these that makes me proud to be from here  on a visit to my hometown i stepped into this place via my peoples people  they had nice bouncers wonderful bartenders fucking the best music i've ever heard at a clubraveloungestore ever and laxed security  they even let the girls rotate and go up and dance next to their residential dancers  their residential dancers were also better than those at other clubs like pure  this venue is definitely smaller than rain and lacks the pyrotechnic capabilities but it has a great view of the strip  once you get in you can also visit the playboy lounge  it is a great visit as well  as always make sure you are looking fierce to go  )  i will definitely come back the next time i'm in town sept  if you have no hookups just get there early 10:30 when they open
1,on a sunday night a few weeks ago and thought it was great great mix of hip-hop top 40 rock n roll etc impressive sound system on the outdoor deck spacious dancefloor that opens up to the night sky great views not sure how it would be to reserve a table but the booths seem like they could hold up to 10 or more guests
1,not really a big club guy maybe it's because i'm not a player (or is it playa  i can never keep track of what the kids say these days)  i hate lines i hate cover charges and i hate $12 drinks that should be $6 on this night i didn't have to worry about these things thanks to a friend of a friend of a friend who got us in without waiting and without a cover (we were more than happy to give him a nice tip though)  so we walk past the line and i'm feeling like wayne and garth holding up their backstage passes in wayne's worldwe get up to moon and i'm thinking "maybe i should change my whole anti-club attitude" this place was great - awesome music some outdoor space with amazing views of vegas and one floor down the playboy club - a casino that features playboy bunnies as dealers  did i mention that i'm also not much of a gambler  i'm thinking that might be changing as well
1,is one of my favorite vegas clubs  the vibe and people are great the views from upstairs on the deck is spectacular and you've gotta love a place with a retractable roof over the dance floor  have not done bottle service but really no need; very easy to navigate even when we went on a busy saturday   check this place out you will not be disappointed
1,moon the music was awesome and the crowd was great too i went with like 14 of my friends and had a blast we didn't have bottle service but the bouncer was nice enough to let us use an unreserved bottle service area the only part that got me mad was the leaving part you know how some clubs you have to try really hard to get in well we practically had to beg them to let us leave they use an elevator and theres like a hundred people going up and down it's really annoying but still loved it
1,damaging your liver it's best to use only the freshest and best quality ingredients and if you want to do some serious damage then you should definitely check out mardi gras  they freshly squeeze the oranges and grapefruits in front of you for your screwdrivers and greyhounds so you don't have to worry about nasty impurities from the fruit juice ruining your cocktail  why make your liver work harder than it already has to
1,personal favorite pittsburgh bar notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks for the first few years i lived in pgh this was our standard last stop before heading home not once did i remember leaving the bar things have slowed down a bit since then mostly because i've also learned to never order more then two drinks it's also tiny so if you want to sit down get there early (or go during the week) weekend crowds are ass to crotch throughout the entire place
1,you bunch of booze bags go home"  i would probably end up staying for days on end if i wasn't told that at the end of the nightgreat drinksgreat juke boxgreat crowdand wait for it a mrs packman machine
1,drinks dark and smoky cozy booths great juke box  this is a bar this is your neighborhood bar  if you need to meet someone for a drink and just talk it out - this is the place  a good friend of mine always points out the ugly carpet  yep the carpet here is ugly but at least it is new  and the place is dark so you never really see the carpet anyways
1,pac-mandrinks and cool laid back setting with great jukeboxvery mellow sit back sip and listen to buckets of rain by dylan and your night is complete
1,lived across the street from mardi gras for a year  it was a pleasure i can't begin to describe
1,is a total hidden gem i was unaware that this bar existed till a friend took me here we were sitting across the street at mario's and he says to me "you want to go some place else and get some strong drinks" this proposition not only got me excited but piqued my interest where are we going and why don't i know about this placeonce we made it inside and up the long set of stairs (i can see myself taking a digger down these after a few manhattens) you enter the dark semi smokey bar this place is divey but not dirty it just looks they decorated it about 25 years ago and if it was good enough then damnit its good enough now the juke box is loaded with classic jazz and blues and normally operates at the guidance of the bartender (which is fine by me he has good taste)the bartender is one of those guys whose career has been behind the bar he makes his drinks fast tall and strong the average cocktail (whiskey and coke vodka and juice gin and tonic) run about $6 and some of their others (manhattan martinis etc) cost $8 the prices are higher than some may be used to but relax its worth it you are getting a rocks glass with little ice filled nearly to the top with your booze of choice and a mist of whatever else you wanted to water down the drink if i'm going to spend $15 in a bar i would rather drink 2 well made strong drinks than drink 15 cups of coke each with an eye dropper's worth whiskey  if you want a place to listen to some good music get schwacked on liquor and enjoy some conversation mardi gras is you joint
1,serious old school 80's glamour waits up the long flight of stairs to marti gras  there's something magical about this dive--even the smoke doesn't seem to bother meactually it's probably the strong drinks that are responsible for thatwhich may be made with magic  who can say  but i'm a sucker for any sort of sweet vodka cocktail in a martini glass and the drinks here will knock a girl off her heels  luckily there's always an attentive bartender waiting to mix one more cocktailbut this ain't no college dive  you won't find too many kids in here which i appreciate  it's dark up those stairs and the jukebox jazz is often questionable but the booths are cozy and the drinks are tall and the beer selection is more than decent  i'll take itps - it was cash only last time i checked
1,is one of my favorite bars in pittsburgh the drinks will punch you in the face if that weird looking guy next to you won't it's a great escape from the bro-scene that is most of walnut st and they have booths which themselves would be enough to make me love this place i've had many sloppy nights here and made many stranger friends order a greyhound and watch the bartender squeeze fresh juice into your drink and kick it with strangers at the bar
1,gras is a far cry from most other bars in shadyside and in the best possible way  dark smoky smaller than most establishments frequented by older patrons and a jukebox with fantastic music from the 60s onward are just a few traits that make mardi gras a fantastic barroomadd to that exceptionally strong but delicious drinks and bartenders that like to keep their clients pleased and you've got a combination that's hard to find anywhere else in pittsburgh  mardi gras also has a perfect nostalgic feeling to it  the wall across from the bar is lined with several large booths that easily accommodate a group of five or six and invite conversation over your stiff drinksthe bar is cash only which may seem like a little deterrent but after you've had a couple mixed drinks you'll probably thank yourself for not being able to charge away too many more  not to mention the awesome cash register that looks like it's about 90 years oldby far mardi gras is my preferred bar in shadyside and you can't go wrong if you're in the mood for a strong drink
1,i die i want my ashes scattered at phil'ssports on television; decent music; cheap beer specials; convenient uptown location; and friendly attractive waitresses  i'm not sure what else you could ask forfor those of you wondering where the deli is in this deli-tavern it is simple:  at lunchtime it's a deli--anything with pastrami or corned beef is decent on the menu  in the evening it's a tavern--eat before you drink unless you want appetizers (which are half price from 4-6)
1,from chicago suburbs so i'm used to townie dive bars and this place is great the service was great richard the manager was fantastic and made us feel at home they were playing the hawks game on the tvs and any bar playing the hawks is a bar of mine you have to try the virtual bowling game so much fun
1,new ownership and management great staff surprisingly tasty food and awesome drink specials 500 red bull and vodka uptown
1,are stiff and the bartender is awesome  i lived in this town for 26 years and didn't know this place existed  come in and ask for justin he'll treat you right  he makes a mad decent tom collinsthe summer sausage sandwich is a pure sconnie experience and paired with the mini corn dogs is the bees' kneesthe sound system is nice and the jukebox is deep if that matters to you
1,bar is now called slice's bullit is gone (thank god) great friendly service great food and the owner is cute as a button justin no longer works there but kimmy and brian will treat you right there mixology is beyond reproach great fish fry and even better burgers
1,try to not speak like a rapper but "haters gonna hate"seriously this place is a dive bar not a high-end french restaurant  the servers sometimes double as bartenders  you do not go to this place for the fast service that is what people made mcdonald's for  you go for the 1lb burgers  they range from $7-$8  how do they make moneyis it the best burger  no  is it in the top 5 of burgers that i have eaten  yes  definitely  everything is well thought out right down the to the bun choice  the burgers all come with kettle chips  i hate kettle chips  hate them  you know what  i ate theirs  so good  yeah the service took awhile but you do not go to a dive bar to get out of there fast  the server was friendly and precise (i did not want onions i did not get onions)  that care barely be said about high end restaurants  it was nice to sit back and relax and then the burger came  they are huge  i had a cheeseburger  i barely made it through half  they are cooked medium well but they are still so juicy  the vegetables are fresh and generous  i had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger  my friend had the bacon cheeseburger  i could barely see the burger under the bacon  it was amazing  i dared not try that on my first time out  i can not wait to try their hot ham and cheese  it comes with two huge slices of ham  they have brunch on sundays  i am talking myself down from finding any excuse to go there again
1,you are craving a massive bar burger from a towny bar this is the place to go the burgers are so large that you should plan on cutting it in half and take the other half home they are excellentif you order the bacon burger you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it i was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger amazing i have also been to the eagle crest on taco tuesday prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see if you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings it's great more than any one person can eat in one sitting this is a bar people don't expect proper waitress service the bar tenders are serving you most of the time just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food since this is a bar maybe the best bloody mary in town it comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp a beef stick pickle and green olives a meal in itself if your hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money this is the place i would suggestmy new favorite bar
1,yum yum  i felt the need to update the restaurant  nothing has changed and that is what i loveconsistency is appreciate when the quality is so high  i appreciate that their burgers are as special juicy and flavorful as always  they are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy  the truth is they stick to good simply and quality food  so thank you for staying the same and staying fabulous
1,liner:  perch rocksif you are looking for an awesome perch fish fry villa is your place  one of the best i have eatenlight greasing and no grease  it is canadian lake perch if that matters to anyonesmall and cozy neighborhood bar
1,husband and i love this little gem of a neighborhood bar we are constantly on the hunt for best "bar burger" (so we have a lame hobbywhatever it's fun) and we agree that villa tap is one of the best bar burgers in town jenny st ground chuck fresh veggies on the burgs good bun also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)all good so far good bloody mary's too we haven't tried the fish fry yet but it's on the to-do list we actually went there for valentine's day - wanted to avoid the crowds in the mood for a good cheeseburger etc - had a great time the burgers were top-notch jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live dead which is great) the regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating "townie-bar" (hello tip top) but the regulars are so nice and fun to talk to owner chico is really nice and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer he's got house of brews on tap even unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages we really don't have complaints at this point we're excited to try their brunch soon
1,you are looking for a no frills friday night fish fry that will blow your mind this is your place i am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal with excellent service  we had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from packers ave) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables we were instantly greeted by our friendly server  though the bar was busy we got our drinks immediately along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw  all very standard issue  the fish was another story whoa  i got the canadian perch and my boyfriend got the canadian walleye  the large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly  it was buttery non-fishy and totally delicious  the baked potato that came with it was pretty standard but good  the perch was battered differently in a thicker more crunchy coating  the little strips were just amazing  i got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that i honestly couldn't stop eating  the fries were done to perfection as well  my boyfriend and i are somewhat light eaters in general but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting  on the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye the bartender wished us a good night and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon  i can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is  it looks like a burned out biker bar but their simple menu is done right  i never thought i would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu but i anticipate we will be back many many more times
1,sketch from the outside but true fish fry happiness awaits i have been going to this place for about one year  the first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone  i had an amazing hamburger instead meat from jenifer st market besides the first time i have always gotten the fish  the perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato  the craft beer selection is impressive  chico-the owner is usually cooking it's a small kitchen so be prepared to wait but it's worth it my fiance usually gets the walleye and loves it it's now my go to place for fish
1,started going here on and off about eight years ago the pizza is the best but the burgers (veggie and regular) are very good as well it's bar food at its very best hot chips with dipping sauce are good too there's often bands on the weekends and the occasional lesbian after bowling league get together but not angry man-hating shemales quite a few different groups of people get together for good beer food and music at reasonable prices
1,of the best bar food in the state  burgers and pizza are always a fantastic choice  entertainment is hit or miss but at least they have some  however my favorite reason to go here is it serves the coldest tap beer ever
1,harmony - or the har bar as my friends call it is always an inviting and friendly place to have a beer  it's a neighborhood bar in the truest sense of the word locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest areas of madison  the food is really nice an up-scaled bar menu  the signature dish the "walnut burger" is truly fantastic  forget about it as a meat-alternative this burger is a unique creation all its own that will make you have desperate cravings  the space is large divided in two one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night  here you will find the livers of the pure madison lifestyle celebrating their lives  these people are happy and they might just make you happy too
1,hubby and i always default to harmony bar when we have a craving for a good burger and a local brew (even before noon) my favorite is the blue burger-a burger smothed in blue cheese and all the traditional toppings the pizzas are worth waiting for-check on the days and times they'll make a pizza for youas always a smoke free environment is worth driving to madison for
1,how i miss you harmony bar  i never miss a chance to grab a walnut burger and hot chips when i'm back in town  this is just a wonderful neighborhood bar  the food is still "bar" food but it's quality tasty and made fresh to order  the pizza is good too  good beer selection and a truly local atmosphere  the harmony fits right into the vibe of the neighborhoodoh how i miss you harmony bar
1,perfect place for the near-east side good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger it has a workaday feel with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town
1,would go here all of the time when my boyfriend was at uw  so good smells like an old bar  a real old fashioned wooden bar soaked in booze  i love ithas a pool table and most of all the 5 star rating is for the walnut burger  i use to be a vegetarian and i would dream about eating that thing better than meat any day of the weeki use to use to  good times :)
1,harmony hours listed are dead wrong and they are open not closed makes me wonder about the fact-checkers at yelp do they have any
1,is one of those places that you  feel welcome and relaxed as soon as you get there i enjoy the food the walnut burger was super different and interesting and although i prefer the beef it was fun to try something differentthe rest of the food was as good as bar food gets but the staff and general feel of the bar (i love the old school jukebox) makes it 5 stars for me
1,rate bar food better than many restaurants and priced right you cant go wrong under new ownership but this hasn't affected quality great blues bar too
1,are the best chicken strips i have ever had  i went to ohio and ate at raising cane's which is a chicken strips franchise and they paled in comparison  even in the city of chicago you will not find a chicken strip as good as here  they are huge if these were indeed the fingers of a chicken they would be of some mutant killer robot chicken that could probably kill us allthe service can be pretty surly and they are kind of nickel and dime nazis with the water and sauce  but the chickenoh the chicken
1,pizza on mondays deal499 for a large pizza with cheese off of eatcucomi got a large with half steak and half italian beeflet me say it was the most delicious hearty pizza i have ever had for 6 bucks i usually get papa johns large pineapple for 5 bucks but it gets old this is good "italian" pizza (as italian as they say they are)anyway i keep reading all these rave reviews about the chicken tenders and as i waited for my pizza multiple people came in and ordered those chicken tenders so they must be goodbut back to my pizza it was amazing i took 2 slices and and im not even hungry anymore this baby is gonna last me for the rest of the night and at least 1 slice for breakfast tomorrow55 stars a+
1,was one of my top places to go on campus it's cheap the food is delicious and you get extremely large portions i probably have tried everything on their menu from one time to another and they definitely do a better job with certain dishes than others but the ones they do well can't be beat the top 5 things are: 1 chicken fingers - these things are the sizes of your forearm and come with a great honey mustard sauce bet you can't finish a 5-piece 2 gyro - i love their gyro's even though you have zorba's and niro's gyros close by i would still go with geo's if not just for their shear size you can fill up just on eating off the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread 3 calzones - they have so many different ones to choose from but i would say the fighting illini the italiano and the steak bomb top the list again these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers 4 baked mostaccioli - amazing pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top i would recommend getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well 5 godfather sandwich - don't settle for the regular italian beef or you are just shorting yourself for no reason with the godfather you get a huge italian beef with melted cheese on garlic bread so good the only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed but at the same time you know it's good if there's a line out the door every night  i miss you geovanti's
1,amazing chicken stripseverything else i've had here is kind of low quality though  the pasta sauce has no flavor and the gyros are garbagehowever the chicken strips deserve the 5 star rating due to the great value and the great taste
1,cheers for geo's chicken strips i'm pretty sure these chickens have been plumped and primed with steroids cause these strips are no jokei'm also pretty sure i represented 5% of their customer base for free chicken strip coupons thank you girl on quad and outside of follett's passing out illini coupon booksmust eat the night of not so tasty the next day unless you put in oven order ahead of  time if possible might take awhile for your call to go throughhoney mustard and bbq sauce all day
1,chicken strips and honey mustard are what brought me back down from chicago time and time again very happy that these two pieces of gold can be found in lincoln park
1,is a true neighborhood bar  quaint divey but great atmosphere  friendly staff cheap beer (with some decent varieties on tap)  since it's relatively small it's nice that it's an over 21 crowd  great location- a campus town secret
1,there about an hour before game time with my daughter who is now a senior at the u of i i wish i had gotten there sooner the place was as good as i remembered it a lot of alums with their original mug club cards  while there were still a lot of students so that the place didn't look like a retirement home i found that while i was standing in line for the bathroom that i was the youngest in line at 50 if you are going back for a game you have to stop here for a beer or twelve
1,i know what you're thinking - you're a chick  why are you rating men's wearhouse  well recently the bf and i went shopping for some business friendly clothes for him  our "wardrobe expert" (and i feel terrible because i forgot his name) was incredibly friendly and helpful that i couldn't help but think - why don't they have stores like this for women  someone who helps you - no matter your size or height finds you the pants that fit your body the dress shirts the jackets etc  this man was absolutely stellar  incredibly personable and he knew his job well  the bf left with exactly what he needed and i may or may not have talked him into a few other items what can i say i like a sharp dressed man (cue zz top)  so if you're looking to make your man a little more stud-ly with a jacket tie dress shirt or perhaps a full suit stop by men's warehouse  you'll be drooling over him in no time ;)
1,went in to get my suit that i bought last year tailored because i had lost some weight and i couldn't have had a better experience when i walked in i was immediately created by bill who was warm and friendly anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit she checked everything even changes i hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done best of all when i asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since i no longer live in pittsburgh they asked when i was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before i left  the next day better yet they had the suit ready for me early avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before i left everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and i will continue to only get changes done at this store
1,eons how you've spoiled me soi remember visiting richard's shop when it was where hey betty is now  trying on monkey fur trimmed capes and hungarian peasant vests  needless to say they know me and my chihuahua by nameeon's selection is amazing  richard is a collector a curator a pittsburgh god of vintage  he hand selects every piece in the shop and will not sell anything if a seam is ripped a button or belt is missing or if it's just stupid he has every item laundered and pressed to perfection  everything is a gem and richard will tell you a bit about where he got the piece and why its design is important  pricey  gawd  everything at eons is a bargain for the quality you are gettinggrowing up on eons' vintage has spoiled me for any other vintage store  i hold every other one up to its standards  thus vintage in la is a joke  a cruel un-laundered over-priced wrinkled moth-eaten joke of the thrift variety
1,love the clothes he has i love the prices i love how helpful richard is  it's got a great location and it's relative to hey betty  which is another pretty good vintage shop  eons is better though  they have clothes for all sizes and shapes  beautiful shoes and jewelry as well  and richard (god of vintage) is just a gem to talk to
1,think i died and went to vintage nirvana when i stepped into eons back in may every single piece is elegant beautiful and either close to mint condition or mint condition richard the guy that runs the store knows about every piece in the store and a bit of its history literally the store is like walking into a museum of clothing from the 1940s-1980s hey betty is really great too although sometimes it doesn't have the sizes i need (i'm a petite 0-2) also look up when you walk around the store some of the sweetest hats i have ever seen (i don't know where they find the stuff in that great quality) are at eons main point: if you love vintage you will love eons
1,want style  you want selection  you want clothes that have been respectfully honored for the wearable vintage art they are  go here  the owner richard is top-notch and knows his stuff inside and out   my only regret is that i didn't have more days to visitmaybe that good thing because honestly i don't think i would have left the store  if i lived in pittsburgh i'd be making weekly (maybe even daily) journeys to the storei'm an experienced vintage shopper and baby - it doesn't get better than this  and the prices - very reasonable for the quality of the clothing which is all cleaned and tenderly loved
1,is a vintage shoppers paradise  the place is stocked full of original vintage finds from the 1920's and on  it may be packed full but it's easy to navigate between the different decades as they are clearly marked in select sections  the prices aren't outrageous if you're looking for something unique for a special dinner or event  you can tell that the owner goes above and beyond to find the best vintage selections  it's not just clothes too but gorgeous jewelry and a very unique selections of vintage eyewear
1,i come all the way to pittsburgh from akron just to visit eons  the employees are friendly & knowledgeable  the clothing is very well organized separated by era and then by size  this is one of the only vintage clothing stores i've been to in the country that has a large selection of deadstock items complete with their original tags  the dresses i have purchased here are absolutely amazing many of them never worn  i will continue to visit on my quarterly p-burgh visits
1,was the first vintage store i ever went to at the tender age of 15 when i was going through my rockabilly phase  i've gone back many times since and even got my junior year homecoming dress and accessories here (it was a red '50s swing dress)  it remains the best vintage store in pittsburgh and possibly the best vintage place i've been to period  eons carries mainly clothing shoes accessories and jewelry from the '40-'80s but don't be surprised to find pieces from the very early 1900s  it's organized by men's and women's clothing then by type of garment and then by size  speaking of sizes there is a wide selection which is so nice as a larger vintage-lover everything is in tip-top condition and very reasonably priced and the staff are beyond helpful and knowledgeable  i've never left empty handed at eons and i dare you to not find something you love
1,are thrift stores and there are vintage stores  there are some stores that are a blend of the two  and then there's eons  eons goes beyond your average vintage shop in that it could be considered a museum of fashion   a lot of their stuff is one-of-a kind antique clothing  you can easily find stuff from the 1930s up to the 1980s  heck in a few years we'll be looking at 1990s grunge here--time to dig out the soundgarden cds  i once bought a clutch purse here  i stopped in the other day and even though i couldn't find anything that quite caught my eye it was still a lot of fun poking around in here
1,lovvvvve this place it's really well organized employees are friendly and i never leave without buying something last time i was here i got two necklaces (the jewelry is great) a quilted jacket and a blazer with polka dot liningi always make a stop here when i'm back in pittsburgh
1,organized and a great selection definitely worth a stop
1,went to the men's wearhouse to outfit our wedding party with tuxes we worked with jack who assisted us beyond our expectations it turned out that we could buy suits for all of the groomsmen for less than a tux rental would cost this meant that our wedding party got to keep their suits after the wedding and use them for business or other purposes - they were theirs jack assisted us in picking out the perfect shirts and ties which we gifted to the groomsmen as our wedding gift i don't think we could have picked out anything ourselves that would have worked as well as what he helped us findeveryone looked great and the best part was that they got to walk away from the wedding with a brand new suit shirt and tie for less than the price that they would have spent to rent a tux and i've returned a tux many times after being a part of a wedding party - often not a fun thing to do the morning after before you catch a flight out of townjack has continued to be a great resource alerting me to sales and helping me pick out what's best for my business attire even after wedding i used to be a solely brooks brothers guy when it comes to dress shirts mainly because i travel a lot and value the non-iron shirts that bb offers (i hate ironing shirts) but jack introduced me to lines that men's wearhouse carries and the non-iron shirts there are just as good if not better than those at brooks brothers though a bit pricey at about $85-95shirt normally men's wearhouse offers frequent 2 for 1 sales that make these shirts a bargain at $42-47i can't speak about anyone other than jack (he seems to always be there) but i can't recommend him or this store highly enough if you are looking to outfit your wedding party or just in need of some business clothes talk to him - he will take care of you
1,husband and i walked in here to get fitted for a tux we are in a wedding out of state and just needed measurements the man was very friendly and got my husband completely measured in 2 mins flat and for no charge even though we weren't ordering the tux from them score
1,was a beyond helpful associate at the store after searching the malls i finally convinced my bf to check out this store great individualized service it was especially refreshing after dealing with the not so friendly or helpful department store associatesmy bf was in a little bit of a bind needing nice slacks for an upcoming interview luckily the men's wearhouse has finished bottoms in many sizes and the bf walked out with a couple of pairs of pants socks and a belt of course they pushed dress shirts and ties and shoes but with a simple "no thanks" we moved on dallas made the shopping experience easy and quick give that man a raise
1,customer service here was top notch we came in to find a suit for my man he is 6'6 and thin so finding clothes to fit him is near impossible we were greeted by steve as soon as we walked in before we know it he had the measuring tape out and several different suit options in hand he also gave recommendations on shirt and tie combinations they were having a 40% off sale on the entire store so we got a great deal they were also able to tailor the suit pants within 4 days i now have the exact pant and shirt measurements which will make it easy for future shopping extravaganzasthanks steve you did a great job
1,wearhouse has always been really hit or miss for me- usually more miss than hit had a bad expeerince with the tuxes for my wedding same thing with my brother in laws wedding same thing with a few other trips somehow this trip was a completely different experience had to get a shirt and tie for a "dress nice please" event so i figured what the h stopped in and was greeted by carmello said a nice hello and let me do my thang after i couldn't find the shirt i was looking for he jumped in to help- the dude was awesome by far the best service experience i have ever had at any one of their stores i got my shirt a matching tie and a new belt all for about $100- not bad he took my measurements right so i got stuff that is comfortable too (kind of the key to getting me to wear it a second time) and was that perfect balance of offering suggestions combined with actually listening to what i was saying i can honestly say this guy will bring me back here
1,minute trip east and had to have a sports coat and tie went to the mw on camelback and they had the perfect set up problem aw it was a 2 for1 saleman i'm traveling don't have room for 2 coats 2 shirts and 2 ties that i will never wearno can do they explainso my search just by chance took me to the mw on tatumenter travis and rich i explained the situationand they're answer was "you get we can take care of you"  we found the same coatthe same shirtand an even better tie   and they discounted to the sale price for the one set  now that's service and that's why i come back  to bad the other guy didn't get the memogreat job travis and rich
1,my gosh i had a blast shopping with my brother today at the men's wearhouse ren was the most awesome sales guy ever and i highly recommend you go see him i usually hate shopping but ren made the experience exciting and fun please go see ren for all your business wear needs and tell him dione and joseph sent you you will not be disappointed i promise you thank you ren for everything
1,enjoyed working with the staff at this location to decide on the tuxes for our wedding we did a fair amount of online research into the color  style we were aiming for and knew which suit we really wanted to see upon arrivalwe were greeted as we entered the store and the employee walked us directly over to the suit we were seeking so that we could see the fit and ensure it was good to go the exact size that we needed was not available in the store however they were happy to order it for us and it was in within about a week  they do alterations on site so you don't need to worry about the suit being sent offsite and they take about two weeks to get done (they will rush them for you if needed - we had the time)  tomorrow we plan to pick up his altered suit and we'll be all set to goall the groomsmen seemed to have good experiences in their local stores as well so it's not a bad chain to choose for all the men in you party if you are looking for a good national chain to make things convenient like we wereoverall: agreat experience quick order fulfillment and alterations on site  we would recommend them to friends
1,in town for a brother's wedding and somehow my jacket sleeve ripped going to a tailor would take too long so i checked out men's warehouse which was having another salei am skeptical of places that always seem to have sales but i got a great deal on two jackets the store selection was good (found my exact size) especially considering they were having a sale and the place was crowdedi forgot the name of the guy who helped me but wow it was like i was the only guy in the place i got some compliments on my new jacket and had a great time at the wedding  i got my original jacket repaired and decided to donate it to my church's social program
1,recently dealt with these guys for my wedding tux fitting went amazing and to be honest the entire staff was awesome every time we came in and paul constantly went above and beyond for us we even had a problem with my dads tux and the men's wear house in tucson and paul fixed it all up here these guys are a cut above and made the experience to be the absolute least stressful aspect of the entire wedding prep and ceremony thanks again
1,store has treated me so well since april of 2013 i buy a lot of suitsshirts and they have always been a pleasure to deal with jason is really nice and the rest of the staff has always been easy to deal with and very kind i highly recommend this store and definitely getting your suits tailored here as well
1,have no idea how to dress my husband and neither does he so i went here asking for help dakota the salesmen who helped me is such a pro friendly knowledgable and put together several options he should style for men's magazines thank you dakota
1,went in on a saturday to buy a suit i was very impressed with the sales associate emmett who was incredibly friendly and helpful after getting measured for the tailoring emmett told me that it would take until (i think) thursday i explained that i would need the suit a bit sooner than that emmett was very accomodating and arranged for it to be available tuesday perfectemmett was also great in that when i explained my budget constraints he didn't try to upsell me (which has happened before) and he didn't leave me when he found out that i wasn't a big spenderi like the way i look in the suit which is also important but it's the high standard of excellent service that has won me as a client for as long as i need suits bottom line gentlemen if you need a suit go talk to emmett
1,am a sales associate for a company called sleep america  i have an appreciation for sales techniques and i am a tough critic i was greeted immediately by a man named alex parsons with a smile he was dressed sharp and was very clean cut he asked a few qualifying questions which i appreciated i had brought in an expensive pair of shoes with me in hopes to find a belt to match he asked for the shoe and immediately found a great belt in my size he then asked if i would be interested in a pair of slacks to try it on with (which was a seamless transition into an upsell much appreciated) but the important thing to note he asked not told i said absolutely i would he pulled around 6 options and continued to explain the different materials as well as styles i decided on a flat front pair of pants made of whool (great quality as well) i asked for a shirt to complete my ensemble unfortunately i have a difficult body frame and have a difficult time finding the correct fit and size he even went to the trouble of asking the tailor to take a look i felt like i was getting royal treatment and alex spent a great amount of time with me answering all of my questions and meanwhile tidying up the store and giving me space i decided to purchase the slacks with a permanent crease and had them hem the slacks as well i was out the door with a new belt a pair of great slacks and shoe pollish to boot thank you alex for all of your great work i have already referred a co-worker and he purchased two pairs of slacks and two shirts the tempe marketplace store is fantastic but more importantly alex was fantastic i would prep him for a promotion if i was in management because he has all of the qualities of a manager if anyone is reading this and thinking of purchasing from this location call and ask for alex he really suprised me because many of the reviews are so-so he was unlike any other associate at nordstrom or macys (which is where i usually get my clothing) call and set an appointment with him you won't regret itthanks again alex danesi
1,love this location ask for sandra in the tux section - she does image consulting and will give you the "god's honest truth" about your fashion picks she picks out clothes & suits for me all the time - she is a god-send seriously - visit this location the next time you need casual dress and formal wear & ask for sandra
1,this location for my wedding tux rental  there are 11 total rentals for my upcoming wedding - me best man 5 groomsmen 2 dads (biological and step) and 2 ring bearers (twin boys)  they got me in and out in about 30 minutes for the initial meeting  they explained all the options pricing etc  very professional  the "kid" (probably 22) didn't provide much assistance or recommendationsbut the other staffers that assisted me did  this part of the review i would give 4 stars - slightly better than average serviceetc  1 star deducted because i have to pick up the tux 2 days before the wedding and not the day beforepopped in there this past weekend for the fittingmeasurements - was in and out in 5 minutes  but then i decided to browse (bc using the voucher towards a new suit vs the free tux)  emmett h - was there to assist me i didn't think i needed assistance (bought many suits in my life) - but emmett was great  he has a calm professional demeanor about him  he was very knowledgeable about all the suits and the origins fabric stitching etc  very very helpful  he then helped me look at this fantastic suit - italian made imported wool german stitching style - top notch  i can't wait to pick it up  emmett said he has 2 (i believe) ft tailors on-hand and can have the alterations done relatively quickly (permitting demand)  i think emmett is my new suit-guy in azoverall - 45 stars  emmett gets 5 the store 4 so overall 45
1,a recent college graduate i went to get a suit for my current and future job interviews i already had a list of my preference in hand as i walked into the store i was immediately greeted by a sales associate who looked over my list and found exactly what i wanted the suit he grabbed also qualified for their buy one get one free program so i ended up getting two suits my interview was the next day so they were able to get it tailored in time for the interview and i pick up my second suit today (one week later) i was in and out in 30 minutes yes they will try to sell you dress shirts ties socks shoes tie bars etc but if you know what you want then its not a big deal i highly recommend this location (by superstition mall) and will be returning here in the future to get alterations done on some of my other clothes
1,of the disadvantages of being a lean tall guy that likes to stay in shape is that it is absolutely impossible to find clothes that fit  my neck is small and my arms are long so i have no choice but to have my clothing either custom-manufactured or alteredartful tailoring is on point in all regards  the owner aladdin dimas a native of damascus syria has been learning the trade since he was 14  he knows cool and he knows how to accentuate the best and worst parts of the human figure  his prices are very fair and his textile collection is world-classgo check him out  he's put together an above-average website which you can access by clicking on the above link to the business' info and i suggest you do soin the market for a new shirt  don't settle for a 'fitted' kenneth cole go give aladdin a shot  he'll make you look like a million bucks
1,in the corner of a strip mall located at the swc of elliot and dobson on the northwest side of chandler  don't freak over the word chandler its just a bit east of the 101  worth the drive  nice unassuming  does great work  i hate when i get pants hemed and the tailor plays chicken and egg with you       "do you want it like this (moves the pant leg up 14") or like this     (moves it down)"  this guy will take one look make a mark and done  perfect every time
1,guy altered a pair of my jeans and a fancy dress of mine and both items came out perfectquick turn around time toolove it
1,my favorite place for tailoring us short people rely on places like artful tailoring it's been a while since i have been in but i have given them everything from my lucky brand sweats to ann taylor slacks to an old pair of jeans for mending i've never had a bad experience here and their prices are fair service is fantastic and you can count on your clothes being ready when promised the store is clean and has an upscale feel aladdin is knowledgeable and friendly they are great at difficult jobs or specialty items too won't ever go anywhere else
1,have bee going to artful tailoring for about 5 years since i moved to the valley and the work is execptionali have had two custom made dress shirts made and about 25 other shirts redone to fit me betterthe work is high quality and well done highly recommend it to everyone
1,don't wear suits often so i totally appreciated their advise on what will make me look my best  extremely professional and they really know their stuff  after they showed me the tailoring that needed to be done i could really see how a good suit is supposed to look  this place rocks  if i had to do it all over again i would visit the tailor before even going out to buy a suit  he helps you know what to look for in a suit
1,can i say about this place but it is wonderful i had three dresses altered there and the prices where way less than i expected to pay my sister-in-law took her wedding dress there for a rush fix and he did it so quickly and perfectly i would recommend artful tailoring to anyone
1,tailor i've found in the valley i'm very short and very particular about fit & length and he gets it right to a t he's talented personable and charges a fair pricebtw i don't get all the bad reviews - are we even talking about the same tailor
1,have been more than impressed by artful tailoring in making some custom shirts for me  they have done a lot of alterations for my jeans as well as a suit that i bought there  seems to be more than legit so not sure why the negative reviews herei guess some people just do not "mesh"  i would highly recommend their services to anyone at this point
1,few years ago i had an unfortunate experience at artful tailoring recently the owner reached out to me after reading review he regretted the situation and wanted to make it righti have a back log of clothes that need to be altered so i was happy to meet with him again i knew he could be trusted with the more complicated items (ie anything other than pants that need hemming) because of the work he did for me previouslythis time i had two dresses taken in at the shoulders and a pair of jeans taken in at the waist the first dress had embroidery at the shoulders so he did an "easy fix" that involves folding the material i was a little hesistant at first but it looks good and fits even better i've never had jeans taken in before so i was worried how they would turn out now my beloved mint jeans fit perfectly with just two small darts sewn in the back they aren't really noticable and besides i usually wear my shirts untucked anywaysall the work was ready when promised i'll be back soon to have some more clothing shortened to fit my midget frame
1,few weeks ago i heard a story that this location was selling suits 2 for 1  i didn't believe this until i got there  how could any place make a deal like this  i ended up getting paired up with a guy named gabe  instantly i thought he was your typical men's clothing store kind of guy until i started peppering him with questions  very quickly it became apparent gabe knew a lot more about both casual and business suits  i had specific ideas for my suits as they needed to breathe well  after showing me several different types of suits gabe picked out 5 suits and i loved eash instantly  i then had to cut down to two suits for the final purchase  he then talked about the positives and negatives of each suit  there wasn't any bs spewing just facts and numbers and personal opinion  i will be back to the store monthly to see what the latest sales  thanks for all your help gage  sorry to ask a million questions
1,staff the guy who helped me was named skip happened to be a suit wizard and got me in and out with exactly what i was looking for the tailor joaquin was awesome as well and knew i was kinda in hurry and got my two pair of pants tailored under 15 min would definitely recommend this place if you need a suit
1,give this place six stars and a bag of chipsi was an usher in a wedding today when i arrived at church i realized that i left my tie (which was by design the same as the other ushers and groomsmen) at home and did not have enough time to go home to get itso with the help of yelp i found a nearby men's wearhouse and called them to explain the problem while heading over they said they had a silver tie but it might not match exactly at this point i'm like "a silver tie that doesn't exactly match is waaaaay the heck better than no tie"when i got there an extremely nice saleslady informed me that they had the exact silver tie over at another store and she would be happy to:1 give me the almost-but-not-perfectly-matching silver tie so i could get back to the church to get to my usher duties and2 drive up to the store that had the exact matching tie and then drive over to the church to deliver itnow like most folks i don't love asking people i don't know for favors and this was a lot to ask for a tie but i've heard brides can be particular about stuff pertaining to their weddings so i figured since she was willing then erroring on the side of safety would be a good way to go so i left with the one tie to do my usherly duties and a bit later the unbelievably kind sales lady showed up at church with the legit tie  wow this was so far above and beyond what i've come to expect from anyone in business i'm still kind of thinking that that will probably never happen againoh yeah i forgot they did all of this for free i didn't have to pay extra for the tie or her time to run get it nadaanyways like i said 6 stars plus a bag of chips
1,have been a member of gwv y since it originally opened  the staff is amazing the location is amazing and the facility is one of the best maintained fitness centers in charlottemy favorite classes are kickboxing cycle athletic conditioning and zumba  note:  i recently started taking zumba at gwvy and the sessions have been greatthe kb instructor is simply amazing  the class and all of the participants are like a family   the great thing about the y also is that we often get together after a great classand go to some of the best restaurants (see my reviews) in the downtown areain addition to the great facility the gwv y does amazing things for the community and offers great opportunities to volunteeri highly recommend the gwv y for total mind body and spirit****i miss my kb instructor but have really enjoyed taking the occasional turbo kick class  the structure and queuing is different but can provide a good workout
1,worked out here for about a month and a half when i was working in charlotte  the locker rooms and the equipment are all very clean and you always have a fresh towel available to you  the staff that work here are super nice friendly and are always willing to lend a hand  i like this y better than the other ones around charlotte mostly because it's not always super crowded and you almost never have to wait to use a machine  i really like the classes- especially spin - i forgot her name but my lady (she was pregnant at the time) was always motivating and kept me going  it's a nice cozy little gym that is very convenient if you live within walking distance  parking is readily available too if you aren't
1,is a really great gym it's very well maintained and always clean the equipment is in good shape and you just can't say no to towel service the staff and instructors are tremendously nice and helpful and the crowd is laid back without the "strutting" that you can see at other gyms i never see it packed or desolate so there's always a good atmosphere of activity without having to stand around waiting on equipment
1,being super convenient to get to the gateway y is clean and the staff is very friendlymy husband and i had been going to the dowd since we got our membership and although i like the dowd it was getting more and more crowded- having to show up for a class 30 minutes before its starts isn't always feasible  the gateway always has plenty of class space- most classes i've attended have had less than 6 people which is so greatall the equipment is very new and clean and you can always find a machine without any wait time- and never have a problem getting a bike for spin (even showing up 5 minutes before)this is now our go to y during the week
1,love the gateway village y  the staff are very friendly and do a great job keeping the facility clean  unlike some of the other y's in the area gateway is typically not super crowded  its a great place to go to take group exercise classesbe sure to look up the parking codes on their branch website so you can park in the parking lot right beside the y after 4:30 each weeknight  otherwise you have to park in the parking deck up the street
1,the new crossfit classes with coach steffie you will get your money's worth and then some i see her almost 4 times a week and i'm fittest i've ever been in my life the y is clean lots of equipment showers are super clean and kept well huge locker room hardly ever crowded
1,gym is bright modern and clean the staff is friendly and helpful and they offer a nice variety of group exercise classes (including crossfit) it's the perfect place to get in a quick workout on your own or try a classthe gateway village ymca is small but i've never seen it overly crowded cardio machines and weights are on the main level with the locker rooms; the group exercise rooms are downstairs check the website for parking information (i walk there but there's a free lot [with access code] in the evenings and they validate up to 2 hours in the garage)
1,far the best gymwork out facility in charlotte  going to the dowd y is like going to work out and then going to the spa it is a completely rejuvenating experience that's a great way to start or end your day  i always leave the y feeling fresh and clean and more alive than when i went in  not only do they have a completely renovated downstairs weight room a number of racquetball and handball courts row upon row of exercise bikes treadmills and elliptical machines but they also have top notch classes trainers and programs  the dowd has classes at different times throughout the day so no matter what your schedule chances are you can find a yoga class or a spin class that works for youthe men's locker room ( i can't comment on the women's as i've never been in there) also boasts an exercise room featuring cardio machines and some free weights as well as areas to stretch and warm-up there's also a  huge whirlpool steam room and sauna  after a grueling workout nothing beats the sauna steam shower combo  the whirlpool relaxes your muscles  the sauna opens up your pores while the steam room helps clean out your respiratory system allowing you to feel revitalized  and the showers wash away the sweat and dirt from your workout preparing you to face the world at the top of your gamethe dowd ymca is a great place; with state of the art equipment  programs classes and  people
1,the money you really can't beat this deal  for half as much as i was paying for my gym membership in chicago i get an all-access membership to the ymcas in charlotte  the facilities are great the staff are all helpful and the dowd branch (probably the best location) is near my homei have heard a lot about the locker break-ins but have been lucky so far (knock on wood)nice work ymca
1,grew up attending the harris ymca so working downtown and making the switch to the dowd was quiet a change  there aren't screaming kids or summer camps just adults getting fit  the classes there are awesome and pretty much every member of my office takes 1-2 every week  the women's locker room has a great little work out area of it's own nestled right in between the lockers and only a few feet away from the showers  it's perfect for when you need to be in and out or if you just enjoy working out in a smaller area  there is a sweet spot for treadmills on the 3rd floor  they face out so you can watch joggers run up e morehead and think about how much harder they are running then you are as you run in place  nevertheless the 3rd floor is never as crowded as the second and you will definitely see regulars  the showers are clean and the steam and sauna are perfect for when you feel it's time for a spa day or even hour
1,dowd y is by far the best workout facility in the area for the money from their class selection to workout equipment to friendly staff you can't beat this gym with a reasonable monthly fee that gives you access to all the ymcas in charlotte this gym is the best bang for your buck in terms of classes the total strength and roc-it circuit training are great if you like direction when doing any sort of strength training the pilates yoga cardio dance and cycle instructors are all quite helpful and make you feel comfortable whether you're a first-timer or partake in a class every day only class that gave me pause was athletic conditioning - instructor bellowing orders at me over loud speakers for 60 minutes just isn't my cup of tea - but it is apparently a great workout as people come out of it drenched in sweat i've very rarely seen an "out-of-order" sign on any equipment and with multiple floors (including weight and cardio equipment in the ladies locker room) you hardly ever have to wait for a machine staff is uber-helpful and always cheery no matter what time of the day fair warning: parking can be a bit difficult in the evenings and is downright ridiculous in january with all the newcomers so if you're trying to make one of the multiple group exercise classes give yourself extra time to park to save yourself some stress overall great experience; i highly recommend this gym
1,y is by far the best offered in charlotte  i really can't think of a reason to give it less than 5 stars  the only sticky issue can be parking if you come during peak hours  this facility is spacious with multiple floors of equipment  there are always receptionists at the front desk available to answer questions (or in my case help me when i forget my card)  i use the women's gym most often which has machines free weights sauna steam room jacuzzi and showers  not to mention they offer free use of their hair dryers and clean fresh towels  the locker room is always in pristine condition  in fact i've never walked in when a maintenance woman wasn't there  they also have an array of classes to meet anyone's needs  some of the other services available that i haven't used are:- childcare-pro-shop (sell gym gear drinks power bars etc)-poollove this place
1,since i have given up on inner peaks (boo) i have needed a new gym to get myself back into shapea couple friends recommended dowd and after a tour i was convinced this would be a great place for me wow this gym is like globo gym in dodge-ball  7 (or 8) floors pretty much every type of service you could look forsmoothie bar dietician towel service etc   they keep things fun and interesting with unique classes so since i get bored easily this is the main attraction for me while i think some of the classes are a bit too jam packed i do think the instructors do a nice job of motivating everyone and offering some individualized attention i've really liked the pool facilities - and have even ventured into the hot-tub (scary at most gyms but really is kept up here) i still recommend wearing flip-flops and showering beforeafter just in case i'm totally with nicole in that kiddies are cute and all but not when i am trying to work out- so i like that i know the pool has never been peed inoverall as a few people mentioned this place isn't completely perfect - parking's a b and  i feel they could amp up the ac in keith gym but overall it really has exceeded my expectations
1,never knew i could love a gym so much so if you look at this gym from the outside it looks a bit outdated before i started going i knew alot of people went there which perplexed me since it looks more like an office building from the 60's rather than a gym but step on it and everything changes they have a beautiful lounge area that reminds me of a lounge area on a cruise ship tons of comfy seats windows and free wi fi too free wifi at the gym yes i totally go to the ymca to get my wi fi on they also have a cafeteria-esque food joint i can do that because of the spacious locker rooms they have they have lockers you can rent out on the monthly or bring your own lock and use one of the daily use ones in the women's locker room they have the standard showers whirlpool sauna steam room but they also have a separate workout room down there complete with cardio machines machines and free weights their showers are bigger than the ones at my house which is pretty small so i can go workout shower dry my hair go to the lounge and "lounge" with free wifi for a couple of hours oh yeah i guess i should talk about the actual gym component eh i've been to different y's in charlotte and y's in other cities and the dowd has the most recent models of treadmills ellipticals and weight machines i've seen for people without cable (like me) they have tons of machines with tv's hooray yeah it gets busy in the morning or right after work but they are open until 10pm on weeknights so there is more than enough time to go
1,this gym  i've just moved to chicago and i miss the dowd y so much  this gym is always clean there are always employees of some sort nearby doing their job of assistance or cleaning  their is plenty of equipment but peak times can exhaust what's available  i don't care i like a busy gym  empty ones are dull and boringbe sure to attend athletic conditioning classes conducted by becky (if you're advanced) and roy ( if you're not yet advanced)  they're fantastic and worth the time you may have to crawl to your car the first time  also take yoga from jonathan or mary  all the instructors are very good but these are my favorites  i miss you guys
1,of all this place is phenomenal  i have a membership to the morrison (close to work) but decided to come try out dowd on the weekend since it's so close to my housei walked in and asked where the cardio machines are  the staff member behind the counter let me know that they have a few cardio machines in the women's locker room and the rest were on the next floor  i walked into the locker room just to check out the machines (imagining a treadmill next to the shower) and was shocked  and i really do mean i was floored  the women's locker room has to be about 2000 sq ft  it's enormous  there is basically a women's gym inside the locker room  i fell in love  lockers a jacuzzi showers mirrors to get ready hair dryers a cardio room changing rooms weight machines yoga mats a tv and more  holy crap did i just die and go too gym-heavenneedless to say i didn't actually make it out of the women's locker room to see the rest of the building  in my defense i didn't really need to  they had everything i needed right there  what a wonderful place  i will definitely be back
1,of all the last thing i would do is rate a gym poorly for being crowded it's obvious right away that the dowd is a very popular place - for good reason although parking came be very limited arriving with that expectation makes coming here at 5:30pm every other day much easier to swallow this gym is flat out awesome many different rooms great free weight area great nautilus section hybrid machine section etcbut the best part about the dowd for me is the lengthy class schedule every day of the week many throughout the day and very accommodating to different sections of the body spin classes are awesome just make sure to sign up for a bike early - they will and always do fill up convenient location on morehead close to many other parks in the area and pretty easy to get in and out of overall i love it here and couldn't recommend it enough
1,recently visited this facility visiting charlotte nc one note i'm not sure why they have this 301 s college st address unless it's for mailing purposes only because they is nothing that a new unfamiliar visitor can use knowing this address that will help you find this bat cave the address on the outside of the building says something totally different and unrelated to '301' 'college' or 'st' but after calling the staff help me via telephone to find their location i was very impressed with the facility and its cleanliness all cardio equipment has there own cleaning spray and towels which is very convenient in that you don't have to walk all around trying to find out where the cleaning materials are located i also took the body pump class with sue m and another young lady the class was great and i'd suggest others to take it as wellalso i got a chance to watch the zumba class (instructor by ms b (*i can't remember her name at the moment))but it looked very entertaining to say the leastgreat job to the staff i'll definitely recommend this facility and will consider returning to it on my next charlotte nc visit
1,was staying at the hilton next door and got access to the ymca  nice  one of the days i woke up with a sore throat  headed to the gym anyways but started coughing horribly just as i checked in  had to walk out to clear my throat then went back in and hopped on an elliptical machine  the lady at the front desk was so nice  she brought me a cup of water because she noticed that i was coughing so much earlier  amazing service  now i wish i belonged to a ymca back home  going to have to look into it for sure
1,prefer ck ymca to dowd during the week for one thing it's less crowded i also feel that people are a bit more "real" at ck i don't feel underdressed when i'm working out and people actually talk to you -whereas at dowd i feel a bit inferior because i don't own any lululemon & i actually take my makeup off before working out don't get me wrong there are some great people at dowd & you'll find me there most sundays -but for a middle class person that works in uptown i find ck way more welcoming & a better workout environment than dowd during the work week
1,came to madison and tried out this club  very  nice for the individual price  a warm pool lap pool two hot tubs cardioweight room upstairs weight room downstairs raquetball courts you name it  had a great workout and and an awesome protein shake at their smoothy bar on my way out  really nice staff too
1,athletic club is great  we use it all the time - swimming classes for the boys and yoga pilates and cardio classes for my wife  no classes for me but i still enjoy the clubmembership dues are right in line with other major clubs in the areahighly recommended
1,i love this place and i don't want you to join it's the antithesis of the meat market known as princeton club sadly smoothie barcafe is gone harbor is a really laid back health club that has everything that i need and more the only downfalls are that it's super old and kind of put together like a corn maze8 years and counting
1,here for 10 years total--  i love clean i love being able to walk away from noisy kids and go into another pool since i am a swimmer i like choices cool people -- members keep to themselves dont try to interfere with your workout with chit chat  i love this  we are busy working out no talking needed  great classes  great equipment and you can use other clubs too with their membership win win but umm yeah don't join k it is hard enough to find parking as it is i went astray for a bit i will admit tried the princeton club to see what i was missing out on all the hoopla what i found was old band aides that did not seem to move for days left around the pool and inches of standing water where you are supposed to wring out your suit nasty i found my way back and like the prodigal son who returns home after making mistakes i am back and i am happy
1,have the utmost respect for dr teng  he is truly the most caring and competent physician i have ever seen always on call and never too busy to take charge at anytime nd he got me through a very difficult time and i know if i needed him right now he would be at the other end of the phone or meeting me at the hospital he is a man with a true commitment to his profession and the finest dr and gentlemen i have ever met his brother works hand in hand with as his antheisologist and also a true professional office staff caring competent and always ready to make things work as you can see i wish i could go to him for everything that was in need of attention i wish him and all his staff the best always and look forward  to my follow up visit in a couple of months one other point of information always has a can do and wonderful attitude thank you dr teng you saved my life thanks again steve & hobie hellerstein
1,surgeon in las vegas  i can only give a double thumbs up  he is the most amazing and compassionate surgeon that i have met
1,teng completed para esophageal hiatal hernia surgery on me in september 2014 i chose him because he has extensive experience as a general surgeon he lived up to his positive surgical reputation with any surgery there are risks and not everything is always perfect with that said i have had minimal side effects to this point 2 months later
1,teng is a great surgeon i was recommended by my oncology doctor i went to dr teng during march of 2014 to get my power port removed a week later i went to summerlin hospital and had my surgery with dr teng after half an hour or so he got my power port out safely dr teng is very quick and cares for his patients would recommend if anyone needs surgery
1,am giving this review 5 stars partly on a leap of faith because it is still a developing business  but so far i like what i see and i see myself being a regular herei was familiar with neos because of the funny radio commercials i heard on kissfm while driving to work  i now have sirius because the repeated shane company diamond commercials where causing me to bang my head into the dash board so often that it was creating a large dent  but the neos commercials were short witty and appreciated  however - this is the not the same neos that you may be familiar with this new neos medspa is under new ownership and management  i was a little surprised with the small size of the new medspa but i was also a little relieved  i was always hesitant about certain procedures because you have to leave most of your modesty at the door and i am a rather modest person  but the small staff (who are also the owners) and homely office felt warming and welcoming  it was definitely less intimidating than other medspas i have considered in the pastneos was very honest and straightforward with me they did not try to sell me any product or convince me i needed anything extra i am easily influenced when it comes to buying things so this is something appreciated more so by my husbandsince i have sirius i don't know if the new neos medspa has radio commercials or if they will have the same comical flair but as long as tom shane is not involved it won't be the most annoying thing on the radio  if he is involved i will be doing a review update
1,started going to rejuvena since 2007 and regret that i have not wrote a review sooner it was called something else at the time but they still have the same wonderful staff i don't even use a primary care physician anymore because i trust dr jain with all of my medical concerns intentionally i began going there for laser tattoo & hair removal and eventually kept going for iv nutrient & detoxification therapy i have referred dr jain to several friends who also see him regularly now i believe in his practices so much that i even did a segment on fox10 news you can view the interview at this link: http:wwwyoutubecomwatchfeatureplayer_embedded&v3xpy8vv6y1q i cannot go without mentioning the women of his office either i have booked organic facials just so i could visit with kimberly who was my laser technician and who i now consider a friend sadly i have moved from arizona but i will go back to scottsdale for work i will most certainly schedule office visits during those times
1,a figure competitor and personal trainer and have had great results with both myself and my clients with dr jain's food sensitivity alcat testing no cookie cutter diets great fat loss results in record time
1,started going to body tech just over a year ago i love the personal attention and customized nutritional counseling that i get from these guys what they do here is unique the bod pod provides so much (accurate) information about your body composition it allows nutrition and fitness experts to truly customize a program- no gimmicks or quick fixes here i work out with my trainer 3 days a week and have seen some pretty amazing changes in my physical ability my husband and i just finished a 4 day hike on the inca trail i would highly recommend checking out all these guys have to offer
1,you want to feel better by getting your systems up and running tired of popping pills instead of truly fixing an issue dr thompson is the man he's honest upfront knowledgeable and a true healer
1,is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful
1,is the most reliable car service i have experienced in pittsburgh amazing service for the last four years we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport they're always waiting by the hertz counter ahead of time without fail even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay they charge about $10 more than a yellow cab if you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport i would highly recommend first class my first time in pittsburgh when the driver heard i was on an interview he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city
1,agree with the other reviewers i tried these guys based on the yelp reviews and was not disappointed i'm a grumpy new englander and have been frustrated by the small town easygoingcareless customer service at many pgh businesses these guys are different: professional punctual (even in snow)
1,customer service  i was in pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport  i found these guys on yelp and the reviews were not wrong  it was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt
1,everyone else i had out of towners needing to get to the airport but i had a last minute work conflict and couldn't drive them i was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn't great i called these guys the night before an 8am pick-up and everything went smoothly dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather if you're planning on getting a cab to the airport definitely use first class
1,reading glowing reviews on yelp i decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport service was great driver was very courteous and on time we used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy the driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment
1,service all around my husband was coming in on a redeye flight from san diego around 9am on saturday morning and just before midnight on friday i realized i wasn't going to be able to pick him up i called first class limousine service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up i ended up speaking to dave the owner and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request my husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--i reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that he was very happy with the service and the price i'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport thanks everyone
1,moved to pgh from san francisco in 2010 and every single dealing i've had with aaa since i moved here has been great -- straightforward super helpful people and mostly quite brief wait times the agent that i have worked with from the start whose name i think is heather (long dark hair second desk from the left) has always been willing to spend as much time with me as i needed to understand what i was buying andor the process that i needed to go throughalso my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me ahem please don't do this) and they were phenomenal i had a check for the full amount in less than a weeki see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related i don't know if those people are even aaa employees they might be dot for all we know i've had three title transactions including one for a car that was from out of state and they all went smoothly i've been with aaa for more than 40 years and when i lived in california i was seriously considering switching not anymore
1,husband and i stayed here for a weekend getaway what a neat place it's a european style hotel (read very nice but smaller rooms) it used to be a monestary back in the day built around the turn of the century it has neat large old molding and furnishings owner was very nice offers complimentary wine in the evening and good full continental breakfast all of that for only $135 a night a short ride from everything includes free parking
1,was so lucky to stumble upon the priory i came to pittsburgh for a conference the westin at the convention center was booked so i had to find alternative lodging and came across this place i love this hotel  the historic building is beautiful  the beds are comfortable the staff are very friendly and helpful  they have a wonderful free continental breakfast in the morning  it's near bars and restaurants a nail salon and a grocery store (i was surprised to find that beer is not sold in grocery stores in pennsylvania  luckily you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk which is open 24 hrs) the local pizza place delivers until 2 am  it's walking distance to the andy warhol museum  also it's only a 2 minute drive from the convention center and much cheaper than the westin  i paid $105night the tv was very small and the water pressure was weak but everything else exceeded my expectations
1,love the prioryi don't remember how we found this place but i feel so lucky we did  a beautiful restoration of a lovely old building the priory is a comfortable tasteful beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city  we found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating plenty of help and advice for weary holiday travelers always delivered with a smile  we will return to the priory
1,thing pittsburgh is not known for but should be is turning old churches into businesses homes and even bars (gasp)  most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space  this is no exception as it's just so unique inside if you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's not a marriott or hilton this is the place you'll want to stay  it's fashioned like a european boutique hotel plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like wifi a shuttle and continental breakfast (score) it's also a really lovely place to have an event  for smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers  i really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range  if i would have gotten married in pittsburgh this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception  the grand hall is just gorgeous  it has the original church organ and stain glass windows  when it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair the northside of town where it's located has walkable access to the andy warhol museum the mattress factory museum the children's museum the national aviary the carnegie science center pnc park (home to the pirates go bucks) and heinz field (home to the stillerz as we call them in the burgh)  some are farther than others but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season  in the summer go for the walk so you can take in the sightsthere's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on east ohio river boulevard which is two streets up from the hotel  my suggestions would be bistro to go and bistro soul rita's italian ice (personal fave) or the priory bakery for dessert  there's also legends north shore not far on e north ave about two streets up from e ohio and amani coffee shop and cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch   it's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because everything is within walking distance  plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along e ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the aviary  the big kayaking organization venture outdoors is right under the 6th st bridge next to pnc park  you're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour  it's a great way to see the citythis is your place for one unique stay i wouldn't steer you wrong
1,stayed here twice during recent trips to pittsburgh and while the city itself is a bit hit and miss the priory is always comfortable and welcoming a great place to escape after a long drive or a stressful drive around the maze of roads and traffic that make up pittsburgheach room is pretty unique and always well appointed and very clean the staff are friendly and helpful with whatever you might need and it's an easy drive to most of the attractions around town
1,here for several days during a very rainy time the hotel is great very charming and fun to stay at definitely not your typical chain hotel as it's an old-style mansionthe continental breakfast was delicious the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful the amenities were wonderful (fast wifi) like others said it felt more like you were part of a fun community due to the interactions with the staff the small great bar downstairs and the welcoming atmosphere the fitness center was well equipped as well and there was a great complimentary shuttle the driver would not only take us to restaurants but would suggest other cool places to visit overall i could not recommend this more the only "negative" is the area where it is doesn't have many other fun places - but they are a short drive away
1,european style boutique hotel  you can not beat this hotel for the money
1,attended two weddings here  both have been amazing  the facility is really nice  the bathrooms are nicewhere this place shines is the food  the food i've had at the weddings has been amazing  the steaks are well prepared the chicken is awesome and the mushroom entry for vegetarians is amazing  both wedding cakes (vanilla and red velvet) have also been awesomei don't know anything about price but i really enjoy attending weddings here
1,banana cream pie pancakes are awesome all the food was delicious though it's crazy that they don't take reservations but it was worth the wait
1,saying this is as good as it gets if you're a visitor coming for a steelers game that doesn't need 5 star accommodations then i highly recommend checking this place out two words: free shuttle hell yes free shuttle to and from the pittsburgh steelers game(downtown pittsburgh hilton about 1 mile away) free shuttle to and from the airport complimentary managers happy hour (two free drinks per person) complementary internet and parking breakfast buffet in the morning seriously as a tourist on my first trip to pittsburgh for a steelers game this hotel made everything way to damn easy it isn't 5 stars for it's glitz and glamour however the rooms are clean and i cannot stress how tremendously friendly the staff is it isn't exactly close to the downtown area but like i said- free shuttles will take you there and pick you up i can't recommend this place enough for it's 'value to complimentary services' ratio made my trip to pittsburgh a breeze
1,time in pittsburgh a great valuefree shuttle tofrom the airport tofrom downtown area (and they will drop you offpick you up wherever within a reasonable distance) the staff is extremely friendly the bed was comfortable and the room was clean it was a little small but it was comfortable only stayed for one night but wouldn't have minded staying for moreoh yeah complimentary breakfast (which i didn't wake up for) happy hour (which i wasn't in the hotel for) and indoor heated pool (which i didn't get to go in)ps tip the shuttle driver people
1,is a review for holiday inn express- greentree (april 7th)it's the remodeled best western inn the new holiday inn greentree is beautifully remodeled and closely located to all the fun in downtownthe rooms come equipped with a microwave & fridge balling tired of take out there's a giant eagle (grocery store) in walking distance can you say convient free breakfast buffet for the guest say what think p diddy status when you walk though the door and everyone is your fonzworth bentley when i return back to "the burgh" i will definitely return back to this hotel
1,place was great the rooms were clean and spacious the decor was modern and fresh the staff were all great and would bend over backwards to help anyway possible plus they had a free shuttle van to take you back and forth from the ball games
1,only been there a few times but it was a nice place - good staff they mix drinks well and it's a friendly atmosphere
1,is one of my favorite bars in pittsburgh it's a bit edgier than most of the others bars in the area which also gives it a lot more character this place is one of the closest things that reminds me of an urban-artsy feel that i'm used to in southern ca shadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics only downside is i'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions but i understand an establishment needs to raise some dough the drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows always good vibes at shadow
1,the best of the 'burgh  great live acts on a regular basis
1,shadow lounge i miss you you're wonderful in every way the dance parties the live music the poetry slams the local art the totally reasonable drink prices the cute and chill proprietor eye candyi could go on stay awesome xoxoandrea
1,a brooklyn based live indie-electronichiphop performer that travels shadow lounge is by far one of my all time favorites  as a pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys graff heads mc's and dj's doing their local thing it's amazing to see this place has become so professional original and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of pittsburgh  the service is delightful on both sides (avashadow lounge) the prices are just right the sound system is a complete banger with crisp and clean sound   the crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music  shadow lounge really holds it down for pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre  can't visit pittsburgh without stopping by shadow lounge
1,a newbie in pittsburgh and have lived in california almost all of my life most recently i was living in the san francisco bay area where dope lounges clubs cafes are bountiful ever since the first time i stepped foot in shadow lounge a sense of familiarity and peace overwhelmed me gotta give it up to the owner justin for creating such a unique and welcoming venue in pittsburgh i can honestly say that both shadow and ava lounge have become one of my new favorite kick it spots hands down
1,food timely charming staff great sound guy and nice environs go here
1,everything from the ownership to the crowd to the live music loved how everyone seemed to actually be dancing and not just standing and staring on the side lines did i mention that it was a live 10 person salsa band yes yet another oxymoron: salsa and snow again only in pittsburgh
1,several nights in a row: thursday saturday & sunday i cannot say enough how much i love love love this place every night was different: african night latin dance brass band (that was amazing) the ownership is way friendly & open to chatting which i love the bartenders are open friendly & genuineanyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book it shows they are listening when they actually ask you a question the ownership was willing to allow us to order & set on fire a flaming dr pepperhad to bring a little southern treasure north ;)i love the diverse yet open and friendly crowd each night i felt right at homenow for the real surprisethe foodwe ordered the~tortas 700we got one chicken & one steakboth were perfectsandwiches with your choice of tofu or breaded chicken  served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with melted mozzarella cheese fried bean spread avocados tomatoes and onions topped with a chipotle saucecheese steak torta 900grilled steak served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with onions peppers mozzarella cheese fried bean spread topped with guacamole and chipotle saucei was shocked & amazed at how wonderful this "bar food" was the tortas were great & the guacamole homemade i will be back every time i am in pittsburgh
1,tuesday nights they have open mic on my birthday (4-12) i went here to check off another life list itemspoken word i did it the crowd was open & welcoming to all that performed there are some awesome artists in pittsburgh also for $500 i got a basket of tortilla chips and 3 homemade dips: guacamole black bean and a verde salsaall were delicious & for $500 it was a lot
1,girlfriends and i (the girl posse) were looking for something to do on a saturday night  being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show  but somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to moondog's for some great live musicthis is another one of those places in which i can't believe i'm the first to review  moondog's is a local institution people  it's been around here ever since i can remember  rusted root played here in their pre-"send me on my way" daysit's everything you want in a small music venue  although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms it's a great intimate venue to see live music  and moondog's brings in the music  it has everything from rock to blues to folk music  the starlite lounge restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club  it's local music folks  come out and support it
1,this place very 1920's cinema feel to it  not row seating but cinema seating  think vegas lounge lizardswith an area for front row standups about 6 people deep be sure to check out "the noises 10" here a great local band that seems to place here 6-8 times a year
1,have been to the visulite theatre once to see the john scofield band  i was not sure what to expect especially since i went by myself   it was  a very enjoyable experience  i ended sitting by the railing above the standing area in front of the band  john scofield is great and the jam band he tours with is fun to watch  i always meant to go back but it never happened
1,i could see a show at the visulite theater every time i come to charlotte i would i'm not sure how long the theater has been around - but i grew up here in charlotte and never knew about it until about two years ago when i went and saw the north mississippi allstars - awesome show i'm home for  the holidays right now and i just saw  acoustic syndicate also a great show fantastic sound and a huge - and very accessable - bar no smoking (or at least the night i was there) but there's a back area when smokers can go overall a really cool spot i'm so happy that charlotte's got a good music venue- woo hoo
1,get warm fuzzies just thinking about the visulite  it's cool laid-back and almost feels like you have stepped into a time warplike some sort of dimly lit lounge from the '50's  the first place i ever saw a concert in charlotte and i was hooked  the prices are standard bar slightly overpriced with teeny tiny cups for mixed drinks  but if the band you are seeing rocks then it's all good  sounds quality is excellent and can be loud
1,venue in town to see a show  over the years i've seen galactic medeski martin & wood soulive victor wooten and many others  can get a bit tight but that's the price you have to pay to see live music in charlotte
1,need to come here again soon it is a really dark tight atmosphere where you can get up close and personal with the acts  the employees are very into the music as well which is always a plus  i hate going to really mainstream venues where the security and bartenders just blankly stare at the guests  these guys are nodding along to the tunes and thoroughly feeling the grooves  someone told me that this place used to be a porn studio back in the 70's this may be one of those city myths but it looks like it could have been  it would be pretty rock and roll if that were the case  anyways i am a huge fan of the visulite
1,been going to the visulite since it opened  it's my favorite live music venue in charlotte  so many great bands have hit this stage  most of the staff have worked here since the beginning  great atmosphere  many wonderful memories
1,spot great music
1,keep it short: awesome atmosphere inexpensive drinks cheap tickets to see great live music all around a cool venue and a great time i can't wait to go back
1,far as live music venues go in charlotte this is my favorite and i've been to pretty much all of them  it's not a big venue but they get some decent acts for my music taste (jamfunkelectronica)cover charges are usually around $10-15 extremely cheap (obviously also depends on the artist)  they also have both beer and liquor  it's nice to have the option some nights i just want to let it all out  the beer selection is good as they have about 10-12 taps with local nc brews and the likes of magic hat sweetwater new belgium etc  they also have a good bottle selection for the stuff that's a little more rare  drinks are normal reasonable pricesas far as the musiclayout is concerned there really isn't a bad spot in the place  it's multi-tiered so lots of areas with a good view  the barentrance is at the top then it drops down to an open area with the sound board and cocktail tables (it's nice to have the option to sit and enjoy the music) and then drops down again to a pit area that's standing room only in front of the stage  the stage is the height of the 2nd level with the cocktail tables so that's usually where i'm at but people are always getting down in the pit  all in all the layout of the place is why i like it so much  the sound is great too  you can't have a great music venue without great acoustics  i always look forward to a show here
1,jazz and they even let people stand in  some high schooler was amazing on the harmonica  as a big slim harpo fan i was very impressed  the scene wasn't smoky at all  very nice although the crowd was small
1,wish i had made it out to this place on my last trip to charlotte pretty much all of the other music venues i wanted to visit reserve their acts for friday and saturday nights (especially on a holiday weekend like thanksgiving) however i'm more of a middle-of-the-week music appreciator for other monday night music lovers this is an excellent place to take a visitor for some straight ahead jazz and blues i used to love standing in line in the cold to see jazz played the way its meant to be played in a smoky basement with singers and musicians jumping on the mic at completely unscheduled times at a little club called small's in manhattan's west village and the ability to enjoy some of the best rockabilly country and blues musicians around (for free) at rodeo bar in manhattan's murray hill any night of the week has also spoiled memy point being - places like small's rodeo bar and double door inn are a dying breed it is your duty as a live music supporter to exercise your right to enjoy this craft in a setting that is up close and personal and velvet-rope-free though i doubt that the double door can draw new york sized crowds on a "school night" if you bring a group of friends here now it could quickly become your own private corner of musical heaven for years to come
1,of the best places in charlotte for continual live music open since the mid-70s the double door inn has hosted a ton of top acts and is always full of people who love music charlotte isn't known nationally for its music scene but with venues like this it is hard to deny that you can't have a great time with charlotte music decent beer selection and regular visits from the legendary bill hanna (at least legendary for double door inn visitors) solidify the inn as a location for musical bliss any night of the week
1,dad was a bouncer here in the 70's and my first visit was with the old man i couldn't imagine any better venue in charlotte they even had a live band on christmas night the last time i was in town can't say enough so i'll leave it at that
1,true charlotte staple  my bf works for a blues music agency in the city so coming here often is a pre-requisite for us  this venue has been around forever and you can really tellit's oozing with history from the pictures on the walls to the original bar  there is always something going on at the double door every night of the week and many many famous faces have graced their stage including slow hand himself eric clapton  the bartenders are friendly will gladly serve you pbr in a can and may even ring the bell up front for a good tip  oh and you can buy scratchers tickets at the bar if you are bored with the band  :)
1,much the spot for local blues  diverse music line-up so you may want to check the website  clapton played there
1,there everyone  this is john the production managersound engineer at the double door inn  just happened across our venue here on yelp and was extremely honored to see so many people saying such nice things about our room  thanks so much to all of you for coming out and enjoying live music with us  its something we love and we're lucky to be able to share it with you  as sabrina mentioned in her review its up to us to support live music and the venues that offer it to you  i'll go ahead and step out on a limb by offering a big thank you from all of the double door staff for the support that music fans have given the club over the past 36 years  looking forward to hopefully seeing all of you again and offering you many more years of great live music
1,a happy diverse crowd especially on a monday night great music nc's oldest blue's club go on monday night
1,better place to listen to live music in charlotte than the ddia historic and very intimate venue recognized as the "oldest live music venue east of the mississippi" and holds the title "oldest blues club in the us under original ownership"  legendary performers like eric clapton stevie ray vaughn buddy guy junior brown and  many others have graced their stage  amazing local talent too pretty much any night of the week  diverse and casual crowd  and now that the place is completely smoke free you won't leave smelling like an ashtray  the double door inn is definitely a hidden treasure in charlotte  get out and support live music and the venues like this that offer it to you  you'll defnitely get your money's worth
1,place to go for both local and national acts everytime i've been it was a great experience
1,doesn't get any better than this my heart overfloweth
1,was another charlotte institution i'd never heard of until i moved back to town as an adult  growing up in the soulless suburbs and listening to nickleback i never really crossed paths with the milestoneoh but it's lovely  there is always something to be said for a divey music bar (every town should have one) where you know pbr will always be the cheapest drink at the bar where you still leave with smoke lingering on your sweatshirt and where you know everyone's just out to have a good time
1,out the grunge the milestone is the perfect place to schmooze with the punks metalheads and venueshow rats crawling with history and plenty of stickers on every surface from showsbands of the past this hole-in-the-wall turned landmark is one my favorite venues in the qc i've been here on multiple occasions and each time has been different and more memorable than the last my first impression a while back was a little disheartening from how many people were smoking inside now so i hear this has been done away with good for us non-smokers and maybe a blow to the cigarette-goers however this paled to the happiness i found in the small bar with cheap pbr and the even tinier stage i've seen this stage packed with 6 member outfits with hardly enough room to play and smaller rockabilly bands tearing it up so much personality there could be a novella written about the days it has seen goodness what a cool joint this place isn't glamorous folks it's an old converted house turned-venue if you're into punk metal or anything in between check their website always booking shows and plenty of variety you can buy tickets online or pay at the door beware on rainy nights the parking lot if you can call it a parking lot haha gets really muddy park on the street to avoid a muddy car or be awesome and park in the mud and make it a story cheers to the milestone and many years to come of kicking some serious rock ass
1,don't know about nirvana but i'm pretty sure i saw black flag their it looked like a small house the stage was just a raised board so called punks slam danced one dressed like a doctor afterwards the band just walked off the stage and drank with the crowd
1,location best to go with nice weather because the atmosphere is all about being outsidenever a better time to go get a bottle of wine relax outside in the nice weather and listen to some music or catch up with friends  wine in all categories under 20 over 50 take your pick because there is something there for youif you're not in the mood for wine don't be scared - there's a pretty nice beer selection as well  for only 4 refrigerators they fit a lot of options inside
1,really a shame people in charlotte don't use yelp very much yet because this place definitely deserves its props as the best wine bar  shop in the area no matter what you're interested in if you want to have a drink the guys and girls here can help you find the perfect match for your palate the wine selection is hard to beat and you definitely won't find better deals anywhere else in charlotte the beer selection is also top notch and they even do a yearly tasting outside with close to 100 beers to sample fromone of the best things about the wine vault and something that really sets them apart from the other contenders in this genre are their weekly tastings for $5-10 (depending on the quality of the wines that week) you can taste up to 6 wines and learn a little bit about each one while you do it there's a large group of regulars who come to almost every tasting so if you're new to the area it's also a great way to meet some really cool people there's also an extensive wine cellar (hence the vault name) downstairs with private bins that you can rent to store you own wine in addition to a much larger seating area that i think most people don't even realize exists they do lots of private events down in the main cellar room so if you want to do a big corporate event like a private tasting it's a really cool atmosphere and something your friends or employees will remember for a long timemy favorite aspect though has to be the almost monthly wine dinners that the shop puts on in conjunction with some of the best restaurants in the charlotte area they are always extremely reasonable in price especially when you compare it to similar offerings around town make sure you get on the mailing list because you definitely want to sign up for these early before they get sold out
1,can't believe i never reviewed this one before  a very classy but casual spot in the university area  amazing wine and beer selection  good cheeses live music outdoor patio(where you can bring you dog)  all of this right by the lake  these guys also schedule tastings and pairings at some local restaurants  ranging from (25-80)ish per person it is well worth it  i highly recommend this place for a casual after dinner date spot or a gathering of friends
1,is the gem of university city it's laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses at least a dozen tables spill outside the doors filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening it's commonplace to have live music from the patio but doesn't overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging the ambiance especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the piedmont of nc the vault itself has tiny quarters but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names both in wine and brews snacks are available with a varied assortment of cheeses pretzels and party mix it's very simple to walk in make your selections then take to the register for purchase the only problem you may find are long lines so i wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom it's worth a drive from anywhere in the charlotte area to see what the ucb has been keeping to itself this place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date relaxing with a group of friends after work or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers if you're single the last one is especially fun
1,spot in university city take your dog and enjoy an adult beverage next to the lake
1,absolutely love this little hang out this is the best place in the area (and among my top pics in the city) for a casual date with friends the prices are reasonable the live music is fun and the dogs are cute the atmosphere of the wine vault is always nice regardless of what you're looking for if you're in the mood for a little revelry with whoever may be passing by grab a table close to the center if a little more room to breath and a little less volume is what you are after just grab a table around the outer edgesi have to admit that this place doesn't come to mind too much during the winter; but every summer the wine vault manages to stay on my ever-changing list of places that i want to be
1,a wine snob so having said that i love this little wine boutique very comfortable and inviting interior comfortable patio area for nice days a very good selection of wines from all price and taste ranges daily varied offerings of wine by the glass or you can hunt through their wine walls for a bottle of your choosing a little chilled something available for the beer and bubbly drinkers great location and atmosphere
1,wine list price not to bad either come during the evening enjoy a nice brezze off the pond while you sit outside and people watch
1,cannot believe there are not over 100 reviews for this place raving about how it's such an awesome hang out  whenever i'm looking for a place to hang out with my friends and catch up the wine vault always comes to mind first  it's usually difficult to catch an open table but once you do it's worth it  you can buy a bottle of wine or a good beer and sit & sip outside (or inside) until your heart is content  they do have a good selection of wine & beer so you're not always (forced to be) drinking the same thing**another bonus: dog friendlinessif you have a dog heshe is welcome to hang out amongst the peoples  odds are that there will be at least half a dozen other poochies looking to mingle just like their owners  **something i'd like to see wine vault do:  set up easy recycling
1,cool we happened upon the wine vault while in charlotte apartment hunting coming from jacksonville fl we've never seen anything quite like this you just go in pick a wine and find a table to settle in and relax its a good inexpensive way to try new wineswe'll be regulars after moving to charlotte
1,inferno plays goth industrial etc music  great place to go and dance and there's plenty of eye candy  wednesday nights are nice and small and leather and lace is good if you like dancing around a lot of people  sabbat de sade is fun for public bdsm sometimes there are cool live bands
1,time here was leather and lace night in oct 2009 finally an adult place to have adult fun not a bunch of college kids goofing around and giggling like fetish night at the cardinal this was much more mature and so much fun everyone friendly so many beautiful sexy people loved the guy in the mesh shirt hee hee ended up getting quite naughty and i cannot wait to return i thought it was much larger than i expected with the dance floor in the front the middle area bar and then the whole area in the back with two more bars therefinally i have a place to go playkissy
1,to live in a city with a club like this
1,love the fact there is a club like this in madison
1,inferno is never disappointing from seeing a23 a few years back to aesthetic perfection just recently they have ac a great stage a really quant sitting lounge area and 2 bars the place is very stylish with great color scheme the bartenders are very knowledgeable on drinks and friendly and quick the prices are moderate for drinks easy to get to easy parking it seemed very friendly and inviting both times to bad the inferno isnt in my neighborhood :)
1,cover charge $8 spacious very good house music no creepers my girlfriend and i visited last night and we had a blast non-stop dancing for 2-hours because the music that that good and engaging; i had to force myself to take a break i love to dance and to have a good time we were both able to do this without being bothered by anyone and with enough space to do to so we did not have drinks so i can't offer any opinions on that after a 4 hour drive from chicago on the same day this was a great place to end up on a whim if you seek a clean good time with good music and lots of dancing then the inferno is the place to be it was cozy nb: no coat check but it was not crowded so placing our coats on the seats and keeping an eye from the dance floor was not an issue happy dancing yaw
1,haven't been here too many times but the place is great it has a really nice atmosphere and looks a lot nicer than the clubs i've been to before the floors weren't sticky and overall the place was actually really clean i really wasn't expecting that especially since i went to one of the fetish nights it's a lot smaller than i was expecting i guess that's probably the difference between clubs in smaller cities and big cities it's not that big of a deal to me but i imagine they can't hold a really big crowd the drinks are fairly strong and aren't too expensive the bathrooms are very clean and well lit the staff are all amazingly nice and friendly i enjoyed taking a drink outside to the smoking area and chatting the people i met were lovely and i'm excited to meet new people at future events
1,favorite venue in cuaffordable ticketsexcellent soundeasy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the "center" wall and cheap drinkshaving been to venues all over the midwest i always find myself wanting to be at the highdive for a show  especially considering a show or tour that would sell-out in chicago might just reach capacity down in champaignhow i miss it
1,never been here for a showwell let me clarifyi used to come here tons as an undergrad for various asian parties and i still come here most times i've visited as an undergrad  things usually devolve into a shit showwhich honestly is a good thing and it's what i'm shooting for when i want to forget about the real world for a weekend  sure it's off campus but it does have a giant dance floorstage and some awesome people behind the bar last time i was here i just kept asking for either a) something awesome or b) something alcoholic  never was disappointed onceif anyone you know is planning a party at the hd be sure to clear your schedule and hit it up you won't regret it (and you might not remember it)
1,been yearsbut i loved going to shows here while i attended isu  very intimate venue to see your fave bands play with good food and libations
1,and my main yelper came from indianapolis to watch corb lund play at the highdive  it's an intimate concert venuebar and we had a great time  parking was a breeze we found plenty of spaces on a saturday night right in front of the venueif you're coming to a show get there early to snag seating  we found great seats up in balcony which had it's own bar  were the bar stools and benches comfortable  hell no  not at all but the awesome drink prices made up for the sore buns  maybe it's because i'm used to paying upwards of $8 for a mixed drink but $450 wild turkey mixers made for a great night  service was quick and i never had to wait around at the bar to get a drink which was niceall in all a great place to grab a cheap drink and listen to some live music
1,this is your quintessential small town concert venue  great prices great service great music  i came from way out of town for an act that i couldn't pass up: the corb lund band  canadian honky-tonk at its finest  what i like most was the vibes - this place has character  you can tell the building is old but from what it looks like it is in great condition  the mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist  i like it  if it's open try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony especially if seats are limited down below  the view and sound is fantasticticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that i saw are under $20 most well below that  corb was $15 and from the performance we got i'd say it was well worth it  what also blew me away was the drink prices i got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5  maybe i'm not used to small town prices but this was an unexpected surpriseall towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like the highdive  i have to agree with jess s on her review; there are not many places like this in the midwest and surely not in indy  keep booking the gigs highdive i'll keep ordering wild turkey and ginger ales
1,am rating the food aspect of cowboy monkey 5 stars because you would be hard-pressed to find a better plate of nachos anywhere for the cowboy nachos alone which are a bed of chips topped with tomatoes guacamole white cheese sauce jalapeno peppers and cilantro chicken (optional) i would swim across the ocean to let this savory swell of heaven crash against my taste buds the food here is excellent though it is on the pricey side when the patio and kitchen are open during the warm months it is worth celebrating sadly cowboy monkey does not serve their tasty tex-mex fare during winter or early spring they open just in time for ebertfest at the end of april if you like americanized mexican food do yourself a favor and check this place out
1,beer selectioni came here with my boyfriend for trivia night which was led by dave the questions were perfect for our group of 7 i even got to answer some ;)since we won that night we got a gift certificate to the bar and bought rounds of shots cannot think of a better way to spend a sunday
1,places rules  great food great drinks great sound engineer (he even gave me a wireless mic) thanks derekgreat staffrad stage fun bartenders vegan options all you can eat chips and salsaoutdoor seating it's perfect rock n roll club
1,let me start by saying the whole "bar scene" isn't really my thing but we went here for a friend's birthday and i was thoroughly impressed the staff was welcoming kind and understood exactly what we wanted we had chips and salsa (a huge portion) and it was fresh and yummy sitting outside was relaxing and lovely peaceful decor and just all around great night can't wait to return
1,you wonder (as you wander) does phoenix have any history that pre-dates 1911 what happened to all the old brick and western style buildings that housed cotton supplies cactus jelly or whatever phoenix would have had stored in a warehouse in 1911  well this is a place that has history (albeit only 80 years or so but hey we'll take it) coming from boston i yearn to have some kind of architectural history buildings that have meaning purpose  character i mean how many adobe style clay shingled buildings can we have seriously so if your looking for cool atmosphere a safe venue (well lite parking lots) and great music check out the brick house i saw okkerivil river here and the experience was great and the venue is the perfect size for a small show they serve a wide range of beer and drinks (food too) my only complaint it was pretty hot inside but then again it's always hot inside buildings here in september check it out you won't be disappointed
1,lived a good 4 blocks from la feria during grad school and loved every second of it yes pamela's is downstairs and if you can avoid drooling at the thought of chocolate chip banana pancakes crepe style you can enjoy the best of peruvian food- pumpkin peanut and sweet savory tastes you can get meat vegetarian or a combo of both (which is always what i ended up with) delish salad to accompany and bread to take those last swipes of sauce off your plate everything is great with an inca kola- and maybe even better with the peruvian mirror you've been eying up on the walloh and they do to go which saved me on my walk home from the bus
1,really love this joint it is small and casual the menu changes regularly and there is always a vegetarian option i'm surprised it isn't more crowded because i can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place the salad is yummy and i'm not even a salad person i think my favorite dish here thus far has been the peruvian corn the atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front
1,place has authentic peruvian food and tasty american style peruvian sandwiches  every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees  they serve these with rice and side salad  my favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato cheese and pea casserole  they also make a great egg salad sandwich with guacamole  the homemade sweet potato chips and alfajores (shortbread cookies filled with caramel sauce and dusted with powdered sugar) are must haves
1,delicious peruvian restaurant is often overlooked due to its location over the wildly popular pamela's restaurant  for those who don't want to wait in line for pamela's or those who are looking for a great bite to eat laferia is the place for you  all of the food i've tried there has been great  their daily specials are usually yummy and their empanadas and sandwiches are great  i especially love their salad  turkey breast over a bed of greens with red onions walnuts and gorgonzola cheese dress in a tasty vinegarette  it's light yet you wont leave hungry  while you're there check out the peruvian arts and crafts  that are also for sale there
1,love this cozy little restaurant  the $10 meal deal is especially great for indecisive diners like me and it's always delicious  i can't comment on how closely they adhere to peruvian cuisine because i've never had it before  the shop is fun too but i'd feel awkward browsing the art without intending to stay so i only look around after i'm done eating
1,refreshing food though the menu gets a bit old perfect unique salad dressing must try it
1,feria recently changed their menu so i thought i'd post a review about their new system they've replaced the rotating daily specials with a larger menu the classics are still on the menu (like the delicious ropa vieja) but now it's expanded to include things like their cheese and potato stew as you'd expect everything is delicious it's also worth noting that the service is quick and friendly and there's a whole section where you can shopperuse peruvian folk art and goods while you wait for your food what can i say i love la feria
1,is a funny city there are fantastic high end restaurants (eg tamari spoon 9 on 9 11 etc) but not so many medium-to-low-end restaurants well la feria is the clear exception for $15 (or less) you can have an amazing peruvian meal my wife and i are experimenting with vegetarianism (i know we're missing out on a lot of yummy meals) and la feria is particularly great for us they always have 2 veggie specials that are great last night i had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantasticthe atmosphere is pretty laid back and the staff are friendly so for a quick and tasty dinner this is the place to go
1,peruvian  love their housemade salad dressing   wish that i could buy it  their shredded chicken dishes are always excellent  great lunch spot in shadyside  lovely little import store attached  a favorite
1,really wish there was some place like this closer to cleveland a fair trade shop with a cafe type restaurant i can dig it its located on the upstairs peruvian art adorns the walls and is for sale they also have some clothes and these beautiful blankets that i seriously want i wasn't feeling too great so i just ordered the three empanada platter and split it with my boyfriend i picked the eggcream cheesegreen onion spicy apple and beef empanadas i wish i was hungrier because it was so tasty boyfriend got the ropa vieja and it came with a salad and rice very very good the girl that waited on us was super sweet too ending check was $25 not bad at all
1,lunch spot  their cubano sandwiches are excellentand always go with the friesskinny perfectly made fries  their mojitos and caipirinhas are the very best in towndinner seemed a bit overpriced but the food is still excellent  the other nice part of latorres is that its in the heart of downtown so plan a nice dinner or happy hour before heading out to hit some more classic bars pubs or clubs in charlotte
1,yum yum latorre's is one of my favorite lunch spots and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been  my personal fave is the pollo chipotle sandwich with skinny fries  their food is amazing and the prices aren't too bad eitheri have a slight issue with latorre's and here it is:  once upon a time i asked for the cubano sandwich but with no mustard  well mr waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way  hmmpre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  i'm a skeptic  after asking around i found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are not pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush  my point:  the next time you want your cubano with no mustard or extra sauce don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you  by the way my spy happens to be an employee so i know it's true  all in all this place is great
1,food is good but to me the desserts are what really make latorre's special they do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magicalthey have great lunch specials it's a little pricey for just me but it's just right for a business lunch with a client it makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and funthere's lots of vegetarian options which is always a good thing everything is presented beautifully which is always fun some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat salsa night is also a good time the crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself i've honestly never had a bad time here night or day charlotte needs more places with so much character
1,i cheated on eliana's with guanaquito i still feel a bit guilty as i've been with eliana's for years but when guanaquito does it better in almost every way how can you fault me if you blink you'll miss it- on mcdowell between the gourmet house of hong kong and arizona endoscopy services you need to park in back accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for guanaquitolike eliana's it's salvadoran cuisine but there are so many more options at guanaquito they serve breakfast lunch and dinner and based on tonight's sampling hubby and i will be back often to work our way through the menu i had the ensalada drink and hubby had the horchata which the waitress patiently explained was different from mexican horchata it sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique for his entree hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again quite different from a mexican tamale- softer and creamier) 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed grilled tortillas) guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than elaina's and they were every bit as good the one that i had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste) definitely delicious at both salvadoran places we were served a bowl of cabbage salad but at eliana's we had never been told how to eat it guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas i was skeptical at first but became quickly hooked it did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas and added a nice crunch and zing the only thing i found that eliana's did better than guanaquito was the flan guanaquito's texture was off but the flavor was acceptablei suppose i'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again oh- and she's cheap too hubby and i got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras i got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow)
1,love the food here i had some sort of delicious fried pancake stuffed with shredded meat & cheese they were called pupusas i cant wait to go back  :p i'm seriously jonesing for some more of those meat pancakes i need more like now
1,love that this place is nearly unrecognizable from the street and that you don't hear a word of english being spoken you know you're in for good food at that point i had papusas and a random sampler - and my favorite fried plantain with beans and sour cream this was good - better than eliana's yes - but both are pretty damn good and i felt like this place was phoenix - super seedy exterior lots of espanol and good food in a strip mall - phoenix to a tee
1,salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas i got  a massive plate of those crispy delicious goodies and an even more massive cup of horchata which could have been a meal in itself our server was super-friendly and patient--it took us forever to decide we left stuffed and satisfied
1,pupusas yes the pupusas are great the loroco with cheese has become our favorite but this past week i strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad all i can say is "what the hell where has this been my whole life" the soup is magical huge chunks of carrot potato and zucchini with some thin noodles and a savory broth with some mint leaves i quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic it was the best soup i've had since coming to phoenix 13 years ago good thing hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more being magical you know it has serious healing properties here's where i learned that the sopa de gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the sopa de pollo is the same thing but with the meat two huge styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $600 i was stunned the owner said it costs more with meat believe me you won't miss it who knew that magic was so cheap hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better
1,have never eaten el salvadorean food before  i was looking for something different and saw the reviews  i called a friend from el salvador and he suggested the pupusas with cheese  they were yummy  its my new favorite food  i will be back  thanks
1,good as it gets  thats a pretty good way of putting it if your into salvadoran food or if you are not this is your place  located near 14th street and mcdowell the building is near a chinese place in an old white building  you have to park in the back and at first glance you may question yourself for choosing this place  but it really is worth it  once you get inside the place is spotless  very well kept  the menu's do explain what you are eating so no surprises  i got the carne asada plate  the steak  was perfectly grilled and seasoned  it came with yellow rice beans a salad and tortillas  the tortillas were thick and grilled  i also shared a bean and cheese papusa  the papusa was awesome basicly a tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese  you have to try it  our meal came with chips and salsa and a salvadorian slaw mixture to share  the price was right and the staff is friendly food a++++++++good for lunch if you work in the downtown area not too packed
1,there twice now  great servers and the owner is a sweetheart  i ate the pechuga asada and a pupusa locoye(sp) this time  the chicken was made right great beans and rice fresh avocado  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent   i live two blocks from here and i need to wake the eff up and go here more
1,going to flat out say this before i start writing the review my aunt makes the best pupusas  now with that being said this is a nice little hole in the wall  the place is nice and clean  the food is cheap and delicious  the people are really friendly and the old man behind the register always seems to great me with a smile ( i think he is the owner)  mind you pupusas are more filling then they look so don't over order  i like the traditional queso con loroco  the plantains are also delicious
1,been wanting to find a good salvadorean place in phoenix and this place is it  we went there on a whim for dinner along with three friends and everyone hands down loved the place  its clean comfortable and charming;  the menu is varied with foods from el salvador mexico the caribbean and even a few american style items  the service is friendly helpful and didn't try to hurry us up  my husband had the steak and onions and it was excellent we all shared several pupusas which everyone loved  and shared a fried plantain with beans and cream and it was delicious  my vegitarian friend had the fried yuca (wout the pork) and she loved it my husband is puerto rican and is very picky about restaurants and had been resistant to trying salvadorean food for a while - but this is now one of his favorite new hole-in the walls in phoenix we will be going back often
1,love love love eliana's i have been eating here for years and enjoy bringing people new to salvadoran food the interior is cheerfully decorated with colorful folk art and the service is always swift and friendly my favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good; 2) the yucca frita fried yucca plant (very starchy like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream a dish i wasn't sure about at first because i am very picky about my banana-type foods but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously deliciouseliana's is so inexpensive and such a wonderful experience everyone can find something they'll like- low spiciness but full of great flavors and textures
1,had papusas and some other things selected at random off of the menu all delicious also shared their fried plantain with beans and sour cream heaventhis place is wonderful and delicious and totally reasonably priced
1,you guys this is a little diamond in the rough nice and cheap with a modest but delicious menu i share the combo platter with my bf and then usually get the chicken which is so moist and tender and slathered in cremeand it comes with a little cup 'o chicken soup which is yum-saucepapusas  need i say more
1,passed this place more than once while driving around i'd always wanted to stop by but never made it much of a priority well i stumbled across reviews here and due to the raving about the papusas i had to stop inmy partner in crime was kind enough to accompany me and as soon as we did we too joined the pupusa bandwagon mmm pupusa bandwagon (drools) we had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa i'm a fan of the chicken soup you get but just wish the serving size was slightly biggerthe appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref pupusa) they also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items yummy gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it i agreed and actually was wishing i'd gotten that instead of the salvadorian marinated steak which was good but paled in comparison to the chickensidenotes: try the ensalada drink it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop which as far as i'm concerned is off the proverbial chain also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in oh and the tortillas are salvadorian style meaning thick and sort of along the lines of a mexican gordita i could eat these for dayspupusas (drools) "give me a towel boy" (drools)
1,cute and cozy place the food was amazing seriously i have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not i'll be returning very soon i got the appetizer platter which came with a pupusa a chicken meat pie a chicken tamale and beans (see pics) everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so delicious i would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food do not be intimidated go for it you won't be sorry my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing i have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly
1,friend of mine told me of eliana's because i was familiar with salvadoran food from la and lamented that i couldn't find a good place in phoenix  i was happily surprised to find the food as good as it was therethat was in 1998  i come here every so often when i get a "hankering" for pupusas and have become very familiar with the proprietor and his family  awesome food awesome service awesome ambience
1,i'll start with a disclaimer i absolutely adore the people that run this restaurant and have been going to their restaurant since i moved to phoenix around '91 (two locations ago)however i have taken countless people to try the food from my native country and everyone has loved it   from my vegetarian to foodie (or chowhound) friends have found something (usually more) that keeps them coming back many thank me for having introduce them to this jewel of a restaurant my favorite is the mojarra frita becaus it brings back memories of growing up in beautiful el salvador  i recommend the especial combinacion de eliana's for first time visitors -- it has a salvadorean tamale wrapped in banana leaf and is moist like a mousse; the tradtional pupusa and a savory turnover called pasteles ($6)  for a hearty meal the i recommend the bistec (beef)  or pollo (chicken) dishes that come with salad rice beans and salvadorean tortillas ($895)after reading some of the reviews i just liked to say thank you for trying out this food but it is not mexican food  i can recommend some of those if you msg me
1,ate at eliana's based on reviews we had read  since we had to be at phoenix sky harbor airport anyway and eliana's was not far from the airport we decided to have lunch  it was wonderful and we highly recommend it  everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious  there were 3 of us and we each had something different  every dish was fresh and flavorful  the juice drinks (i wish i could remember the names) were very good  we will definitely go back
1,this place service is always excellent-- it's usually the owner that waits on you the food is wonderfully flavorful without using a lot of spice natural flavors are what makes this place ticki've eaten here many times and my recommendation is that you just order every appetizer on the menu and forget the entrees at least the first time you go anyway you'll want to try it allvery good food
1,local business with international flavor  what's not to like
1,you haven't been to this place - go seriously it's amazing it's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find and it's cheapnestled between stores like big lots and some electronic place with mexican ranchero music blasting this tiny place is hidden in the corner the owner is from el salvador so don't expect it to be mexican food -- there are many similarities but the dishes themselves are differentwalking in you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central america it's amazing there are only a couple waitresses and i don't think they speak much english but the menu is in pictures as well as in spanish and some english so you should do just fineget the pupusas - they're like thick hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork cheese and beans or my favorite cheese and loraco flower which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus to me it's definitely the best one these things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't just ask for the salsa) and are very fillingthe other dishes are really good too for a low price you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's they put slices of fresh tomatoes avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the platesi honestly love it here if you want to avoid the crowds come at an off-hour then you can just sit relax and watch the telenovela on the tv in the corner for dessert pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash registeri can't recommend this place enough
1,writing this review i was contacted by mangt wa very nice letter apolgizing for the mis communication  between the server and us  and explaining the dishes we ordered my mis conseption of the beef dish weggs my wife had any business that takes this kind of action to make sure it's patrons are satisified deserves 5 stars we will be back       thanks
1,i went to this place for the tamales which were recommended by a coworker who is from el salvador someof the people in my office also said that they were amazing (and i trust their opinions)  so i went in looking forward to that and ended up ordering all the pupusas as well i must say i'm not a big fan of the tamales they are too moist for my taste the banana leaves do give a great flavor though the true stars are the pupusas which i had never had before and have since become addicted too i literally order at least 6 for myself every time i go now they are asininely delicious i grab a large bite of pupusa and some of the curtido (a kind of slaw-ish awesomeness) and just chow down beware the post-lunch coma though as eating that many will knock the average person on their ass this brings me to my one bone to pick with this stripmall gem their coffee sucks i was expecting super-strong coffee with mud at the bottom when i ordered the cafe listo but it tasted like gas station coffee they didn't even have any milk just powdered non-dairy nonsensei'm already a diehard fan but if they stepped up the coffee i would pretty much call it my mecca this is the kind of food that makes all seem right with the worldholy shit i almost forgot about the ceviche it's a little pricey but it is soooo worth it i split it with one of my people at work and ended up sharing it with the whole officevery much against my will people thought it looked so good they just kept poaching forkfulls off my plate definietly a must have dish
1,this restaurant with a groupon probably would not have if i didn't have the coupon don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in the restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly and the food wow  we split the shrimp ceviche and the combination pupusa plate the portions were very generous i ordered the fruit drink everything was absolutely delicious one of my new favorite restaurants  will definitely be back
1,thank you salvadoreno for making my pupusa loving dreams come true i just moved back to the valley after 6yrs away having discovered and fallen in love with el salvadorian food in the mean while i was worried that i wouldn't find a good spot here as we some times lack in fine ethnic cuisine that isn't mexican i was tickled pink last night to discover salvadoreno in an unassuming strip mall in mesa (they have 2 other locations around the valley) the food was blissfully authentic as was the price they even suggested a deal on the menu for 20 pupusas for $30 i might add this place to my bi-weekly grocery shopping list i can't say enough about how happy i was to get real el salvadorian food that hadn't been taken over by the flavors of mexico us or arizona one of the family members who runs the joints was even there and everyone who worked there was quite friendly i'm happy to support these guys i will definitely be returning
1, this is one of the few places that i actually have cravings for  you can't go wrong with any of the papusa flavors (carne asada is my favorite followed by loroco flower) and the fried plantains are an excellent treat  eat the papusas topped with the curtido (coleslaw) and salsa it really pushes the flavor over the top
1,pupusas  i still can't get them to come out right at home so i go here
1,good pupusas the carne asada was my favorite we also tried the sampler platter it was nice to try a variety i things i would really recommend this place
1,is great food is authentic and the service is nice nothing wrong at all my fav place i'm gonna try the fuego pupusas today
1,pupusas are amazing and they're cooked fresh so it does take quite a while to get your food however it is worth the wait i'll be bach
1,food and delicious mojitos atmosphere is inviting and comfortable food so good and authentic that i felt like i was back in san juan i will most definitely be back and i'm telling everyone i know
1,good haven't been able to stop thinking about it need to go back asafpgo for:- black bean fritters- pollo cubano- pulled porkfriendly service authentic caribbean feel
1,food got a coupon off groupon to try this place - yummy is all i can saydelicious food with a menu with something for everyone had the fried plantains and bean dip as appetizer - great change of pace from chips and salsa the main courses were phenomenal and the rice pudding was the best ever try it little pr icy but very good and unique food - wonderful wonderful service
1,the black bean fritters were as good as everyone said and i loved the pork paradise my boyfriend had the ropa vieja and loved it  he also thought the black bean rice mixture was the best he ever had  the sangria was good but the mojito was the best highly recommend  if i am ever back in scottsdale this place will be on the list
1,here while on vacation over new years the food was delicious tons of vegetarian options yam soup lentil stuffed chillies plantains and black bean dip a week later and i'm still salivating over the lentil stuffed pepper the covered outdoor patio with a fireplace adds a nice ambiance
1,excellent always at the top of their game awesome people
1,food the plantain fry reminded me so much about the ones we get back in my home state of kerala india the other entrees were good the food is not spicy but if you prefer spicy food they will bring along a spicy sauce if you ask
1,went here for lunch and it was yummy  i had the pumpkin bisque soup to start and then the combinacion de favoritas  wow  the flavors and spices were just a perfect blend of sweet and spicy  the portion size was large i was very full and still had some left to go  i will definitely be coming here again  there are lots of tasty sounding dishes on the menu
1,had an excellent dinner at havana cafe - i would say it is in my top five restaurants in phoenix service was decent too - i am surprised to see the negative reviews on yelp  i may be a bit biased because i studied in costa rica in college for a few months so i love any latin american and carribean comfort food because it brings back great memorieswe shared the platanos maduros and mofongo as appetizers and some mojitos to drink the mofongo did not sound great to me when i looked at the menu description but it was amazing the platanos were great too i had the pumpkin bisque which was sweet salty creamy and delicious and some rice and beans my husband had a pulled pork dish which was also good and we had some lime pie for dessert next time i would order  a little less foodbut i am glad we could try each dish - everything was good we will be back
1,i needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good cuban cigar and some brandywe had the papa rellena for an appetizer very very good its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime saucefor entrees my wife and i shared two dishes the ropa viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the gallina frita (crispy fried shredded chicken onions in a mojo garlic lime sauceamazingboth dishes were largewith tons of meatgreat service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the havana cafefor dessert we indulged on the "best of phoenix" (phoenix new times) caramel flan omg and the coffee was yummy too we also found a 15% coupon in dineinazcom saved us almost $7as the sign over the door says "cha cha cha"
1,sisters columbian friend pointed us in this direction i enjoyed this new ethnic experience the moment i walked in i was reminded of my my aunty's old restaurant shop i do mean to say "restaurant shop" because that's exactly what it is a restaurant and shelves of snacks toys and other take-home things i guess that's one reason why i love this place for taking me back to a childhood i almost forgoti've never been to any other columbian eatery but word is that the portions are huge which they were for me and my sister anyway we shared this plate of "tamal" which came with a side of rice by the way the rice was surprisingly sweet almost like sticky rice it really complimented the spices in the tamal i've also discovered the best made empanadas ever probably even better than filipino empanadas x it's unique for it's crispy crust and its pasty potato & beef mix inside and what set it in stone for me was the ajiahjiahhee (oh whatever the spelling is) saucethat place brought together family mainly because we realized we were sitting next to the family of my sisters friend they also have a huge extended area cus the area we were in was the "restaurant shop" but the other side is specifically restaurant it's good for big groups and such cus yeah i'm all about rolling deep i'll take my friends anywhere we can fit
1,place has excellent food and service i tried the ajiaco soup and it was the bomb especially when adding the sour cream i also had the empanadas and papas rellena and they were also to die for i recommend this place for everyone to try
1,this place grew up in la and had home made pupusas  my bf house it's just as good but it would hit the spot
1,their squash with cheese pupusas honesty when it come down to authentic salvadorian food you must try them here beside they are huge and i easily get stuffed with 2 try them and to drink make sure to try their kolachampan (salvadorian soda) i so recommend for you guys to try them out
1,about ten years this place has been my family favorite restaurant every time they change something is for the better love the food you can find the most of the salvadorian plates try the corn milk in winter time is so delicious i love the new look inside the restaurant
1,down still my favorite place to come for pupusas in town this location has recently remodeled inside and it gives it a nice friendly face lift the pupusas are always so hot and fresh and always cooked perfectly not oily or too much masa and not enough filling the curtido here is always crunchy and delicious never too salty or vinegary i also love the variety of fillings they have at this location for pupusas chicharrones and cheese is one my favorites but the calabasas and cheese is definitely in my rotation now i recently had the yucca and fried chicharrone and while it was not as delicious as my pupusas it was good the fried pork was definitely fried as it was super crispy and once i added some salt and tomato sauce it was good eats the yucca was perfect soft and creamy on the inside and a nice bite on the outsidehelpful hint: call your order in ahead of time if you don't want to wait long for your food  also know that they charge $100 to use your debit
1,downthe best papusas in las vegas and hendersonthe great thing about las pupusas is that no matter which location you go to around town the food is consistent and so tasty i get queso and chicharron con queso with extra cabbage the pupusas are made fresh to oder so it takes some time to get your order well worth it the fried yuca is good as well as the platanos con sour cream
1,el salvadorean pupusas and tamales our family loves when i bring these home
1,pupusas in town very casual dine-in or take-out is available great prices too
1,time in this restaurant and i must say it was absolutely delicious i got chicken tamales and i have been looking for something like this since i moved from california 15 years ago spot on yummy
1,food big portions cheap price its pretty decent looking in there and its clean only negative thing is parking is somewhat complicated mhmmm steak breakfast burritos :)

1,this place is killer  dam good tacos and mad fresh too good shit  nice and clean  came at lunch 12  i'm so dam surprised this place aimt swamped :] give this spot a shot 
1,place is amazing jim is a great artist traveled all the way from tampa just to get my tattoo i would recommend this place to everyone
1,my first tattoo here in 1993 and my second a couple weeks later all these years later they still look great haven't faded much and haven'thad em touched up the shop is professional and clean i highly recommend excellent quality work
1,prices but good quality and amazing designs that are custom made plus gel and solar nails are available for those interested offers waxing services completely renovated and the spa pedicure chair is amazing
1,have been getting my hair cut and hi-lighted at mane attractions for over 5 years by sue the owner i am always extremely happy with the way my hair looks   my hair is very fine and i don't have a whole lot of it but sue does wonders with it especially with my latest cut i never wanted it shorter than shoulder length but decided recently to make a change because i'm getting older and other methods of increasing the volume and amount of my hair were too expensive or didn't work  i wanted to try a shorter cut the cut she gave me made my hair look much thicker i have had several compliments on the cut one from another hairstylist who worked at regis sue is also reasonable charging $80 for my cut and hi-lights i will admit that i had to wait outside the salon once when i was the first customer of the day but that was once in over 5 years i will take an occasional late opening in exchange for the great cutscolor i get
1,me just tell you i have really really difficult hair  type 3b naturally curly 100% grey i dye it dark and mess with the color myself ( never good)  if you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair since i have been going to mane attractions i have really loved my hair i have been going there for about 4 years kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet ( you curly girls know what i am talking about) i have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed the only complaint i ever have is that yes sometimes i have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week i just know to call and schedule things it is a small business and i get it  ps kids haircuts are only 10$ and my daughter loves it
1,place does gorgeous updos for $25 apiece my bridesmaids and i went there on the day of (with no trial run beforehand) and we all had beautiful hair exactly the way we wanted it the hairdressers are so friendly and attentive and so accommodating in letting 5 of us take over their relatively small shop for 2 hours on a saturday i was so happy to find them and so happy not to pay $60+ a pop for wedding party hair
1,my hair done in an updo (for only $25)  yesterday for my wedding  they did amazing  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it  great service   the price is not high but the quality is
1,is a godsend; went in for a simple fuss-less updo and was stunned by the result she is quite the perfectionist and for $25 her mastery is bizarrely affordable forever bookmarked (note: street parking can be fairly difficult to find on s highland so scour the smaller adjacent streets for a free 2 hours)
1,for a quick cut  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish
1,is amazing for updos only $25 a piece but great attention to detail
1,have been to the downtown izzazu location several times (i have not yet had the chance to check out their new digs however) and have always left really pleasedi have used their waxing and haircut services and have had no complaints  in both areas the girls i worked with took the time to listen to me before beginning work and i ended up with exactly what i was looking for  i always got compliments on my hair after getting it cut  as for price - their stylists are tiered and have different price scales  i asked while on the phone making my appointment and had no surprises  after trying many salons that didn't make the cut (yay puns) and ending up with bangs mullets and other horrible cuts i am sticking with izzazu
1,performs amazing feats on my fine hair and is able to accommodate to any stylecutcolor i throw at her - but not without making sure it's what i really want she explains how a cut could work or not work for your face typelifestyle etc and really takes the time to listen she's both professional and personable and i wouldn't want anyone else to fix my hair woes but her
1,been going to meg f for two years and i've loved every cut she's ever given me she listens to what i want but also always talks to me about how my hair type will respond to certain styles i have difficult thick wavy hair and she does a great job managing my hair and teaching me tricks on how to style at home plus she's very nice and always in a great mood so i really enjoy my time there izzazu has a beautiful new location right downtown next to the capital grille parking is super easy too if you tell the people at the garage on oliver street you have an appointment there are reserved spots and you can just take the elevator right up to the salon great for bridal parties too they have a gorgeous place for groups called the serata it's a formal styling suite for groups and private parties really unique
1,is the best at the downtown location i have had horrible mess-ups from other salons and she is able to fix them immediately i will never go to anybody else she listens to what i want and is able to perform
1,- exceptional talent - multiple services - top notch - check it out at least once
1,have been coming to the carrick cost cutters for several years and have had valerie cut and color my hair all those years  she is professional and talented  i get what i need and am very pleased with my styles  my husband uses this salon but he does not limit himself to any one stylist and he is pleased as well
1,barber shop is good old fashion at its finest  the convo was perfect sports and everything in betweencut and price also very nice
1,staff same starbucks fair you get anywhere else  sometimes the lines can get long
1,location  close to shops and theatre  nice staff
1,starbucks is 5-star friendly the shift supervisor lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light he recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience kindness generosity and fairness i left that afternoon loving starbucks even more than when i went in it's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them
1,am always so pleased with the customer service here for such a tiny starbucks the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy outdoor seating in the summer is nice
1,my recent road trip from dallas to new haven ct randy s and i stopped in pittsburgh to revel in its charms this i must add was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of "there's nothing *in* pittsburgh why would anyone go there" tazza d'oro is the answer to that question especially if you like coffee this is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the mississippi and i've been to a lot of them so what's so good about itlet's go in order of importance:coffee - it is really really good they use batdorf and bronson beans where an ex-gf of mine used to work in olympia believe me when i tell you that b&b is good it's not amazingly great but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously when i go to a new coffee place i suspect might be good i always get a latte why this one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly i got a latte they have a few sizes 12oz was the first one i got it was fantastic they did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is) the baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema the coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold smooth and rich which it almost never does and this place had it down) i had to go back for an 8oz which is another level of trust it has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality it was always superior this is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone but there was more pastries - they all looked amazing i had a plain donut while i waited in line normally i don't eat plain donuts because life is too short for plain donuts but it was really very good everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries wereatmosphere - this place has it exactly right it's a mom & pop feel nothing forced some tables outdoor seating maybe some local art but not in a goofy sort of way very friendly employees just a complete home run obviously i loved it behind me in line for my re-up i heard a girl behind me in line complain "we could just go to starbucks it's cheaper" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk that's fine everyone has to do what they like and with the proliferation of bad coffee (starbucks only being guilty of mediocre though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years i don't blame people for being set that way but the beautiful thing about tazza d'oro (cup of gold in italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on halloweentazza d'oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to pittsburgh
1,is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town it took me far too long to come around and love tazza d'oro a horrible ex of mine loved this place and i admit that this soured me i regret the time i wasted not going here the dark wood inside comforts me the small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer tazza d'oro brews batdorf and bronson beans (amazing) provides enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs i've ever met (amazing) everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do they have a small menu of localfresh food that looks amazing but i have never actually eaten it the espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at batdorf and bronson locations in olympia wa i talked about this with one of the barristas at td'o and they were offended - "we calibrate our machines the same we use the same beans the exact same blends and milks and everything it can't be different" sorry tazza d'oro you are better the lines get long on weekend mornings but they move quickly there's a sense of community nestled here just off the "main drag" of highland park between bryant st and the reservoir this is where you can pick up your csa shipment for the week where multiple weekly bike rides originate where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day the percentage of students is low like the rest of pittsburgh there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know but generally i see people i like and miss which is different than the norm in pittsburgh for me
1,you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop  i am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop  i am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing  it is 11:30 on a monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going getting coffeeit is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place elseenrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet hereother reasons to love this place (i know some of the other reviews highlighted these but i thought they were worth repeating)- free wifi- outside tables- tasty treats- they have a blog- really great coffee- the staff are coffee experts
1,i am not a coffee drinker i do love their iced mochas  they have wonderful teas cider hot chocolate  the servers are wonderful and the brownies as big as your head are like crack  amy the owner has created a wonderful place for community
1,d'oro has a generally european decor with dark rich colors and textures and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space the espresso is bar none the best i've had - including my admittedly limited travels in italy it's stellar espresso - rich thick potent without being sour or bitter with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather but are always fantasticthe coffee is also terrific and tazza d'oro uses batdorf & bronson beans - the best i've ever had for home grinding they have a good selection of pastries and cookies as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side saladin addition they have a wonderful selection of teas; i'm no expert and don't know their supplier but the half-dozen different blends i've tried were all memorably flavorfulall that and it's a lovely center of community where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day no one is rushed out the door and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation
1,independent coffeeshop i've ever had the pleasure to visitbest americano i've ever had  some of the best espresso i've ever had  great desserts pastries and cookies  good food  the employees are awesomethe owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it  the shop is also all about bicycling as transportation sponsoring regular group rides around town and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined
1,love this place the best coffee in the 'burgh good atmosphere great service the food is really good too
1,of my favorite coffee places in pittsburgh they also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food otherwise they have plenty of pasteriescookies to eat that are pretty good
1,of the best coffee i've ever had  everstick with an italian cappuccino and bring a good friend for some good conversation
1,service amazing coffee nice vibe
1,vegan food in pittsburgh  yes  great music friendly accommodating service huge variety of drinks fabulous decorcons: not a convenient location for the car-less me but well that's just mehi i am a non-drinker and rarely have i found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks  granted quiet storm like many pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do  ginger lemonade  yes  all these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me  yeahi do love my meat but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but i attribute that to my love of meaty things)  they used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends but i think they got rid of that due to a low turnout  too bad most of pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love cultureusually good music acts here  although the few times i was here there was barely anybody else there besides the group i dragged along and the band's friends  usually 2-3 acts play  live  and it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close  and be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music  the bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehousei have never been here during the daytime so i can't comment on that  always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there)  sometimes a minimal cover for the music  there are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers
1,used to live about four blocks from the quiet storm and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair  those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year when my friends and i would stay in our studios all night working haul ass out to quiet storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class  and then usually i'd take a three-hour nap after the first class  but i'm sorry what is it i'm reviewing herethe quiet storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble i've ever had  i'm an accomplished vegan eater (i get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten) i've had the best scrambles new york and san francisco have to offer  believe you me quiet storm tops them all  i wish i knew their secret recipe but the part i do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference  come in on a lazy sunday morning get the nothin' fancy and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be  on top of that they are as vegan-friendly as can be with earth balance for the toast; soy rice and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes  plus sandwiches  get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap ask for added tofu (planks not crumble) and be astonished yet againand and as a delicious cherry on top they have theme brunches fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at  check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is and make a point of going  get there early
1,all about the black & gold (only on the brunch menu now though)and the tofu tendersand the vegan baked goods from my goodiesmy only complaint is regarding the vegan milkshakes sorbet does not a milkshake make
1,looove quiet storm it's a pain for the car less (me) to get to and the service is fairly lacking it's cash only with no convenient atm's around the closest business is a mcdonald's half a mile away and i still go there every chance i get hipsters abound (pro or con depending on who you are) and the place is really child friendly (again could be a pro or con) but generally the crowd is mellow reading chatting just enjoyingthe menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :) between the veg and vegan options they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too not an easy thing to doa lot of the reviews here are about breakfast which is amazing but my favorite are their dinner salads they're protein heavy with a huge variety of ingredients not your typical salads and their specials like tofu curry are amazing and always enough food for twooh and the drink menu i'm pretty much a water coffee beer kind of person so i haven't tried too much on it but everything looks amazing quiet storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things but what they do they do damn well
1,not sure how it took my wife & i so long to find this place before visiting the quiet storm i didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat i ordered the "maelstrom" which is a what i would call a mediterranean quesadilla the flavor was subtle but delicious there were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community the only complaint i would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door and it was winter finally remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay i was not disappointed by the quiet storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time i'm in pittsburgh
1,is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on pittsburgh's east end  it is also a haven for the veganvegetarian hipster  i've been a handful of times now and only once did i get food i wasn't happy with  prices are reasonable maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay  keeping this place open is well worth that costif you aren't feeling so hungry this doubles as a coffee shop (lacks some coffee shop seating) and the hot drinks are solid  check out the milkshakes
1,only  what a pleasant surprise  i went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in  the place seems to have some spacial issues  there was a bar but they don't serve alcohol more of a coffeediner bar  the tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable but maybe this is by design  i am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf  anyhoo to the food  this place is vegetarian only   i started with a hummus plate unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite  the hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers carrots celery calamata olives (big fan) and pita perfect starter  for my main entree i ordered the curry special  do not expect an indian food experience but this will not disappoint   everything was in the bowl chick peas basmanti rice carrots and other miscellaneous items  once i started dipping my pita into it i could not stop  it was savory spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night    this is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time
1,storm was the other bookend to my trip to pittsburgh providing a perfect balance with zenith earlier in the week it's a little out of the way but once we got there it's exactly the kind of place i want to live close to it's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on it had a very good neighborhood vibe and everyone working there knew the place and the area really wellthe drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine but the ginger lemonade i ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal i wish i could have that more often the food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what i wanted i had the dagwood sandwich which was a perfect mix of sweet sour and spicy with hummus apples hot peppers cucumbers and pickles it came with an option of the side and i had to try the mockamole a big fan of guacamole myself i was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version i also really like peas though so i was open and somehow they managed to make it work and it really did taste very much like guac with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture but definitely worth a try my friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and i honestly don't remember what else but it was huge and really tasty she chose the potato salad as her side and it was the perfect imitation of german potato salad so i was pretty happy all in all if you're in pittsburgh and feel a little lost go to zenith and quiet storm and you will feel found
1,unique atmosphere (hippie  indy  hipster  whatever these kids are calling it these days) interesting tasty food above all awesome retro decor a pittsburgh treasure
1,was really impressed by this place i will first start with the service: the waiter was very friendly and it took me awhile to go over the menu since i've never been there he was patient and stated "take your time no hurry" he offered me suggestions we even discussed shoes for a brief minute very personable the food: the menu was quite extensivehoagies soups pasta salads etc they also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese i ended up ordering the lentil loaf with steamed vegetables and smashed potatoes the food came out quick like 5 minutes and everything was fresh and great did i mention this also came with soup i paid $13 total for my meal and a cold chai could not ask for more my only and i mean only complaint is that they only serve lunch at lunch time the only serve dinner at dinner time etcso be mindful of the time of day you go
1,atmosphere great barristas great coffee locally roasted forget those uptown coffee shops go downtown mt lebo for the best all around coffee house experience
1,starbucks is right down the street from my parents house it's gotta be my favourite location in the pittsburgh area i read joe d's review and laughed a bit he's rightthere are some guys who sit in there but have you ever said hello have you ever asked them if you could sit down they're totally nice guys the baristas here are really efficient (most of the time) and super friendly they're on top of their game and even remember regular's drink orders
1,and his team are awesome the store is beautiful and sparkly clean my beverages were on point and the pastries were yummy great work guys
1,now that the old timer glee club has abandoned this location i can truly say that the relocation of this 'bucks has become my favorite totally comfortable location somewhat friendly associates no fireplace anymore but i can overlook that lots of comfy leather chairs you feel totally at home here normal coffee and tea menu pastry case is always tempting and filled parking can be a hassle but isn't that the case with any outdated strip malls in the burgh
1,been coming here ever since i can remember the baristas seem genuinely interested in your well-being they all have great personalities and are a joy to talk to when i come in dan while appearing super intimidating (spiky black hair wears leather jackets and stuff) is extremely nice i went away for college and when i came back he asked me all about it becky always remembers my orders and astrid makes my iced coffee just right i could sit in there for hours and i often do
1,barista was super sweet i told her i wanted something new and she was a fountain of information she made a lot of great suggestions and i told her to wing it she went with a caramel brulee with two pumps of white mocha she also gave me a discount which was awesomei used an aircard on the netbook and sat in starbucks from 11am-2:30pm i had headphones on and just zoned out i was comfortable and wasn't disrupted at allit seemed to get busy from 1pm-2pm so if you want to stop at this location make sure to get there earlier so you can grab a seat
1,have a very very soft spot in my heart for this starbucks  i spent my whole college life and a little bit after serving up market square's best coffee tea and assorted goodiesi know i'm totally biased but i really do feel like this is the best starbucks in the city  no other store has such a cozy feel to it  i may have fallen asleep in the big comfy chairs by the fireplace a couple times  i mean it was hard slingin coffee all day  especially when you have to get up at 5 am to be there at 5:30 am (yeah i totally rolled out of bed to go to work)  it gets slammed around 6:30 or 7 with the before work crowd  i can still remember people's faces and what they ordered  i could never understand the woman who ordered a venti (large) 8 pump white chocolate mocha with whip every morning  i guess girl needed her sugar to survive in the am  the nice thing is they're always open  much to the chagrin of me and my coworkers with the madness of light up night and st patrick's day drunken festivities  but it's nice for the tourists to stop in and grab a quick drink and some advice on where to go downtown on a saturday morning  i'm thankful now when i'm downtown on a sunday because i know it's one of the only places open  it's just a really great place to meet a friend to catch up or sit and study  plus they offer free wi-fi which is always a plusjust remember barista's are people too  grunting out "tall coffee" instead of a hello doesn't usually fly as a good greeting  cheer up you're getting caffeine soon
1,was great fun personality quick at getting you through your order and super nice we shared a little joke as i made my order - kind of hard to explain here - but made the mundane experience of ordering a coffee into a lot of fun which is great because i was just heading off to the airport for a nice long vacation - started me off with a smile :-)best cashier ever
1,you are a serious coffee drinker or you know someone who is this is the perfect place to buy bulk coffee  and if you do have a good friend or relative who loves coffee this is the best place to get a distinctive gift for that personnicholas coffee company has been around a long time since 1919 actually  one  thing that makes their coffee so good is that they roast them on the premises  you can really taste the difference versus getting bulk coffee at starbucks or dunkin' donuts  some of my favorite blends include the ethiopian harrar costa rican tarrazu and if in the mood for something a little stronger and darker i recommend the french roast  they have their private blends tooi'm not into tea as much although i'll buy here in the summer to make ice tea  and they do sell chinese restaurant tea which rick and i love to brew when we order chinese take-out  they also have a lot of boxed teas and gift teas for the tea lover in your life  want to know what "china gunpowder temple of heaven" is  http:wwwnicholascoffeenetwebstorestorefrontitembuycfmitemid451they also have a lot of teapots and coffee makers if you are looking for a nice gift for someone  and how many coffee roasters sell cigars  my confession:  i've smoked cigars on rare occasion and i actually do like the mild ones  one last thing their website http:wwwnicholascoffeenetwebstorestorefrontstoremaincfmcfid4407284&cftoken92186416 is very good and it has a lot of good tips on brewing good coffee and tea
1,time i visit from chicago i run over here before or after visiting primanti's  i've even demanded we stop here before returning home - i buy enough coffee to last me 6 months when i know i will return again  it's the best place in pittsburgh to buy coffee & tea in bulk  i buy a coffee to drink as i shop a few bags in bulk for family members and a ton of smaller bags for myself at work  they even have flavored-honey filled straws for tea cigars and all sorts of accessories  i love stopping here during the holiday season  i make a huge gift basket for my parents  and it's all at a great price
1,into this shop is like giving your eyes a sweet indulgence and the sensory aromatics of freshly roasted beens will leave your taste buds craving for that hot java  rows of specialty coffees teas and candies line the walls  and create the feeling of a genuinely unique experience it's got a small town feel which is rmost efreshing for a downtown location specialty drinks are their modus operandi like the chocolate banana bread latte or my humour favorite: fat guy in a little coat latte i have been in a number of times both in busy rush hours and during the inbetween hours the service has always been friendly efficient & creative so don't hesitate to ask a few questions and try a new combination i'm also a huge loose tea fan and have yet to explore this aspect of the shop they seem to have an impressive inventory this is the best coffee and speciality  bean shoppe in pittsburgh hands down
1,have no complaints here  european-style shop for gourmet coffee and tea  you can buy fresh-brewed coffee or beans and loose leaf tea in bulk starting with a 14 pound and up  besides that the shop is crammed with coffee and tea supplies candies and chocolates  good prices  friendly knowledgeable staffi usually buy coffee but the last time i went in for green tea and wanted to try something new  the man who waited on me didn't know a whole lot about tea so he did something amazing:  he found someone else who didtip: go on thursday afternoons when market square has their farmer's market and pick up some fresh produce and pierogies too
1,love nicholas coffee i have been working near market square for over a year now  after my first few months of starbucks disappointments i ventured into nicholas they have a very large selection of coffees teas and european import items their pumpkin spice latte not only tastes like pumpkin pie but its a full $2 cheaper than starbucks'  every day they make fresh whipped cream roasted peanuts and peanut butterall of the baristas are extremely friendly and helpful they also have amusing facebook updates some of which contain bill cosby sweater references i also enjoy their innovative latte creations (see the 'batman' themed latte menu i posted) nothing to complain about
1,the return of nice weather to the'burgh i've been able to get out on lunch and do some shopping  i took a stroll down here 'cos it felt good to get out of the office and besides i'm getting a little tired of the coffee from giant eagle  maxwell house and folger's are okay but soemtimes we need a little varietyso i picked up some olde vienna which is a little darker than most american roasts but not as dark as french roast  i also picked up a nice kenya aa blend  but i'm also become a tea lover and i picked up some stash decaffeinated earl grey--makes a great ice tea  great coffee and service here  it's been a few years since i was here last and i'm gonna have to stop by more often
1,of the best places to buy coffee in the city the raspberry truffle latte is my personal favorite but be sure to try their other speciality drinks that they post great location (market square) great environment and atmosphere and friendly and helpful staff get a cuppa
1,coffee ever i never miss an opportunity to try whatever flavor of coffee they are brewing at nicholas coffee co every day they have three different brews one being flavored and all delicious they have every flavor you could possibly imagine (and sell the beans if you don't want to wait for them to brew your favorite one) the candy shop is pretty awesome too
1,i worked downtown years ago nicholas coffee was the "nuts" so to speak   now that i'm back working in town again i was ecstatic that i can get a fresh cup of fabulous flavored coffee every morning as i walk to work through market squareif you are a high maintenance coffee person this is the place for you  the flavored coffee is the best one can immediately taste the difference from the brews here and the nauseating hazelnut that is sold at every other place that sells coffee  that flavor should be banished from the earth but that's another storytry the graham cracker chocolate orange almond joy or coconut delicious  nicholas also carries freshly baked biscotti in a variety of flavors as well as other eclectic baked goods a must stop for visiting guests and coffeetea lovers
1,are in fact "the oldest coffee store" in pittsburgh being created in 1919 i wanted breakfastlunch and nothing was open in market square until 11am so this little place caught my eye they don't roast pack or warehouse their products but roast small batches of arabican beans daily at optimum temperatures to insure peak flavor upon walking in i was greeted with the scintillating waft of fresh coffee beans tons of different flavors of torani syrups also lined the walls making my decision even that much harder they had fancy lattes with turtle chocolate raspberry etc enticing names i decided to stick with one of their brews for the day: southern pecan roast and had it just black it was quite delicious my sister just asked for a large coffee on ice i'm not sure which roast she ended up with but the flavor was gone after she drenched it with milk and nasty saccharine still delicious for an iced coffee but i can't deal with those people that like their coffee in milkshake form upon leaving and inspecting the various bags of beans and teas i noticed this place also sells cigars hot dog what a gem
1,is probably the best place in pittsburgh to get an espresso cappucino or latte  it's a small no-frills coffee company -- don't come in here asking for a soy non-fat no-whip caramel crappacino or whatever because you will be laughed out the door  they roast their own coffee and you can also buy their coffee (whole bean or ground) and take it home with you to brighten your mornings  they have a coffee-of-the-month club which i aspire to join somedaythe best time to visit la prima is a saturday morning in early fall  the strip will be in its full bustle  go up to the counter try to puzzle out the italian saying on the chalkboard while you wait order a coffee and sit outside at one of the iron tables  the delicious-smelling coffee steam will waft up in the crisp morning air old italian men will have just started their mornings of sitting outside smoking cigars and making fun of each other over interminable coffees and all will be right with the world
1,espresso hands down makes me want to hop on a plane and come home for a weekend just to wake up on a sunday and hear italian men next to me while i sip my espresso machiatto
1,draws me here is the ambiance it transports me to a grungy neighborhood caffe typically found in italian small towns and villages in other words the place is a charmless room awash in harsh fluorescent lights  it has a couple of high tables but no seats (well when the weather is good they have outdoor seats) the regulars take their espresso standing half chatting with each other half watching whatever rai programming that is showing on the tv  in addition to the espressocappuccinolatte i recommend the freshly squeezed juice i don't know why but theirs just taste better than others i also like to get a breakfast pastry from the bakery next door
1,an amazing find  i have become so jaded in my travels with generic coffee shops pretending to be italian because they have italian roast coffee and a picture of the colosseum above the register as if that is all it takes  no this place is the real deal through and through  i really felt like i was back in italy the moment i walked in  up on the tv there was an italian football game being broadcast in italian  in front of me in line were a group of people discussing the merits of lambrusco wine from modena and how its "denominazione di origine controllata e garantita" certification is reason enough not to confuse it with lesser imports marketed under the same name  mind you this conversation was entirely in italian  meanwhile behind me there were some old men have an entirely different conversation in italian  this was by no means unique to my first visit either  it really is a slice of italy hereauthentic ambiance aside the coffee is rather good too  my only lament is that their large is not an americanized large  they have a pretty nice selection of bags of organic and fair trade beans should you wish to brew some at home  espresso  they are actually one of the wholesalers for espresso machines in the city and they actually service the machines  yeah they know what they're doing  you really can't miss at all here  the best part though is that this is genuinely a place where you want to hang out relax and socialize  it's wonderful
1,am one of those people who needs to put things in my coffee i can't drink it black  la prima espresso company has actually broken me out of this habit i went back here several times over a 3 day period during my visit in pittsburgh we stumbled across this cute italian coffee shop on our way to watch the runners at the pittsburgh marathon i needed coffee and i needed it now this was the first place i saw  to my amazement the coffee was probably some of the best i've had i kid you not  i did not have to put anything in it (i did add some cinnamon though)  it is fantastic  perfectly brewed to perfection  i even bought a bag of beans of la prima's own grow pittsburgh brand bold flavor that they have made locally it's deliciousthis is a really authentic italian coffee shop attached to a bakery and a wonderful find right off "the strip" in downtown pittsburgh
1,rarely blown away by coffee  i mean mcdonald's and dunkin donuts make some reasonably tasty coffee at very affordable prices  i've never been a fan of starbucks too bitter and expensive  but when i can i will frequent local coffee shops looking for something amazing  well la prima is that something amazingi first encountered their coffee at coca cafe  i don't usually taste coffee and say "wow that coffee is really good"  but on the occasion where i first tasted la prima that's exactly what i said  that was months ago and i don't know why it took me so long to make it down to their shop in the strip  perhaps because it is the summer and one of the last things on my mind during this time is hot beverages  now every time i brew some of those fresh beans i feel like i'm treating myself and i enjoy the taste of just the coffee without adding sugar andor cream it's a very welcoming place if not a bit overwhelming with all the choices  but if you're in the strip and looking for a good cup of coffee la prima espresso company is highly recommended
1,best place for coffee i love everything about this place the atmosphere the neighborhood feel the baristas and the patrons (especially the little italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos) a huge favorite place in my book
1,prima is an excellent no nonsense coffee shop  it gets very crowded on saturdays but i always try to stop in for a double espresso  you're not going to want to bring your computer
1,little shop and delicious coffee they have all the regular stuff with a few specialty drinks the menu is mixed in with some fancy italian terms :) i decided to go with moka which was a really good choice and without knowing what egg cream (chocolate) is my friend ordered it out of curiosity we were told that it was made out of sparkling water (they use san pellegrino i believe as they also sell that as bottled drinks) chocolate syrup and foamed milk it was served on ice i have never had the combination of milk and sparkling water and it is surprisingly good good option for non-coffee drinkersthe best part it is 2 doors down from a popcorn store(which is also a local favorite too expect lines out the door) we ended up sitting outside enjoying coffee and popcorn for the rest of the afternoon
1,espresso i have had outside of italy
1,had a fantastic experience here i got to the shop just before they weer about to close but the owner was very gracious about creating an arrangement for me the flowers were lovely i would make a special trip just to purchase from this shop again
1,from the botanical emporium did my wedding flowers and they were absolutely beautiful they were so easy to work with and made me feel completely at ease my flowers were everything i ever wanted and more when i saw my bouquet it actually brought tears to my eyes the greenhouse is amazing  i very highly recomend the botanical emporium for all of your floral needs
1,a cool place i have no green thumb whatsoever but had passed by for about a year now since i moved to dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute now was my chance as i needed a last minute christmas present for my grandma the place is larger than you think from the outside they actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants i couldn't identify i thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase not in a pot and looked really cool and modern i loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself if i wouldn't kill it (which i probably would) i had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art they turned out to be flower displays for hotels but man where they cool if i was doing an event or having a wedding that's exactly what i would have wanted they just looked really modern but creative they also have some winged friends you can say hi to including one screaming one in the back that you can't see kinda creepy but i guess that comes with a unique shop i will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events i have coming up
1,floral arrangements for every occasion  her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school  you cannot beat the service here  when students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2  blooming dahlia is the best example of hometown service i could imagine
1,buy those old pre-made arrangements from the grocery store or the overpriced stingy bunch of flowers from other places  come here- the service is great and the price is very reasonable  without realizing it we walked in 5 minutes before closing time  regardless the owner greeted us warmly and said she would be happy to help us  i told her i didn't know anything about flowers so she asked for a price range and the proceeded to select and arrange a fresh bouquet  even though it was the end of the day the flowers were still perky and the arrangement was spectacular  couldn't have been happier and will recommend it to everyone i know
1,best bouquet of flowers i have purchased in years the store was closed but the door was unlocked and the owner gave me a warm getting and created a great arrangement i love that they do not sell pre arrangements all are made as you wait the so smells amazing well be my new go to for flowers
1,say that these guys go above and beyond is an understatement  my daughter was recently hospitalized and her boyfriend sent flowers  unfortunately they were delivered to the hospital the day my daughter was discharged (a good thing that she go out early)  jim from blumengarten called me from the hospital - which was a good 25 minutes away and offered to meet me halfway to ensure the flowers were delivered  he told me he would meet me in about 30 minutes  we both pulled into the parking lot at the exact same time and my daughter received her flowers  i know who i am ordering flowers from next time i need them  thanks again
1,chose them because they answered the phone after 5 i was originally going to use a nearer florist the worker i dealt with was incredibly helpful as i did not have an exact address to give him only the name of my girlfriends employer he said he would look up the address and number then call them for exact directions the flowers were delivered within 24 hours and were the best i have ever purchased i wish i could give them more than five stars
1,live in virginia and my wife's 72 year old mother lives in pittsburgh we typically send her flowers for her birthday but we've had some issues with the well-known national flower delivery businesses so i thought i'd see how things went if i cut out the middleman and dealt directly with a local florist it was a good move the flowers arrived on time and according to my mother-in-law the arrangement was spectacular and the flowers were so fresh that she was sure they'd keep for a good while i also was happy that ludwig's didn't gouge me on all of those extra fees that usually get tacked on at check-out by the big companies my advice from now on is to go local whenever you can with the internet that's no longer a problem
1,live in boston mabut my boyfriend lives in pittsburgh and i was in need of flowers for a funeral service  considering i know nothing about what is top rated in pitt i looked to the web to try and find a good florist  i saw blumengarten and glad i decided to use their services  the gentleman on the phone was so wonderful  i explained that i needed flowers delivered to the funeral home in a few days i told him the two flowers that were her favorite and said that they needed to be used but to do what ever else he thought would make the flowers beautiful  i gave him the amount i wanted to spend and left it all up to him  absolutely wonderful customer service   the day of the service i got a text from my boyfriend saying my flowers were stunning and and the most beautiful ones there  was so happy i chose jim ludwig's blumengarten florist and will continue to use them  on a separate occasion i also ordered some flowers online and had them sent to my boyfriends work as a surprise  again absolutely beautiful cheery flowers  i got a picture of them sent to me and couldn't have been more happy with what was delivered
1,can't say enough good things about jim ludwig's blumengarten  we hired them to do the flowers for our wedding in april 2012 and the flowers were gorgeous  my bridal bouquet was so beautiful and fragrant that it made me cry  what i especially loved was that jim and linda ludwig personally delivered the flowers to the venue  jim pinned the boutonniere on my husband and personally handed me my bouquet  such excellent customer service is rare these days and i highly recommend this business
1,a foreigner and wanted to send flowers to my girlfriend living in a suburb of pittsburgh i contacted jim ludwig's blumengartens florist after finding them here unfortunately they didn't deliver to the city i wanted my flowers to be sent to but the ludwigs have been very helpful and transferred my order to another florist that covered that area the contact has been fast and very friendly i'll recommend and would consider them again
1,ludwig at blumengarten is the best i had a last minute event for which i needed very specific flowers i called in to make sure they had orchids which they got just for me in less than a day i wanted to pick the rest on site but got there with a few minutes left until closing time and in a rush to deliver them myself bob made me a beautiful arrangement at a reasonable price very quickly i am going to go here for all my future flower needs
1,worked with sherry at jim ludwig's for our wedding flowers in june 2013 they did a truly wonderful job the flowers were stunning sherry was great to work with and they were very respectful of what our budget was many other places i went to advised me they could not remain within our budget and therefore they lost our business (and our budget was very reasonable) so i appreciated how much they worked with us definitely recommend them
1,just utilized this florist today for the first time my mum's bday is today and i decided last minute that i wanted to send her a bouquet of flowers for a reasonable price and same day delivery while looking thru some florists in the pittsburgh area i saw a yelp review that this florist delivers on same day service i visited the website and saw so many bouquets of beautiful flowers at reasonable prices i contacted them via phone- placed a same day delivery and overall was very pleased w the customer service my final review of blumengarten's comes down to the approvement & excitement of my mum- who was very pleased w the flowerskudos to blumengarten you've gained a new a customer
1,ordered from jim about 5 or 6 times and each order was flawless they do everything right - efficient in taking an order putting together a beautiful arrangement and getting it delivered when it is needed our most recent order was a few days ago for a funeral viewing and it was very nice as always  great people quality work and you don't need to wonder if they are going to get it right they are our go-to florist

1,little home decor shop in pittsburg  we stumbled upon this place while exploring the city  i posted some pictures for you to check out  they have a great selection even though it's not a massive store  people are friendly and well trained to help you find whatever you are looking for
1,this store  so beautiful and filled with many inspiration pieces very much on the pricey side but a check online shows me that their stock is not too overpriced this is def a room in heaven :)
1,love this store are you looking for -a selection of stuffed ratssunglasses shaped like martini glasses or dollar signs or heartscheap pittsburgh mugs or magnetsic light or steelers merchandiseold fashioned candyparty hatsok you get the idea this store is stuffed full of all kinds of things that you will suddenly absolutely need and it's reasonably priced it's also the perfect place to buy some junk to take home to your friends :)
1,is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the strip a wide variety of party favors and pittsburgh paraphernalia
1,is such  fun store  i mean what place can you go into buy a steelers mug a candy necklace and some plates and napkins for a party  want pittsburgh themed merch  they've got it  need party supplies  they've got it  need a bouncy ball  they've got it  you really need to step in here to get the full picture of everything they have to offerbecause it's basically everything  i've come in here looking for one specific item and walked out with twenty non specific items  that's just how it goes here  seriously if you're throwing a themed party looking for unique gift or need steelers merchandise this is the place for you because you'll more than likely find itand walk out with more than you planned on getting  but that's the fun of shopping here
1,freakin' love this place anything you could possibly want they've got it and probably a lot of stuff that you don't want i loved that everyone listed the crazy things they've seen there - they have all of that and so much more 2 gems a friend got while we were there: a giant bottle of sriracha sauce & a fake tattoo sleeve haall i got was a postcard this was the only place i found in the strip district that sold them will definitely be back and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time
1,holiday graduation breast cancer awareness month and other things they have it they have an assortment of things and it's an amazing shop they are real friendly and it's a great place to go to get party items
1,little store which sells italian (irish and some other) decor and home-y things rocks maria the owner also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs if i still lived in pittsburgh i'd live there
1,can't believe there aren't more reviews for this place i didn't get a chance to look around the store - i went for a meal in maria's kitchen upstairs  it really is her kitchen not a restaurant there is only one table that seats 8-10 people  but her cooking is amazing  lots of home-style italian favorites come out in a fabulous 6 course meal  i could have eaten just the antipasti alone as a full meal; the standout was a baked pumpkin full of gruyere herbs and croutons delicious  for dinner we had butternut squash soup with gorganzola and pecans homemade pasta with a pistachio cream sauce veal chops and an italian vegetable medely that was perfect with everything else  tiramisu for desert  everything that came out was delicious and perfectly prepared - plus maria was standing right there in the kitchen to answer any questions we had about the food or cooking in general  wine was byob and i think we went through ~10 bottles  no corkage feesthis is an amazing dinner for those who have patience  maria is booked around 7 months in advance for those looking for a weekend date  do like i did - make your reservation put it on the calendar and be patient it's worth the wait
1,can't say enough about merante's and maria the back of the shop has wonderful baked goods pies breads and of course the best biscotti around though the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week i heard about the private parties while at a food tour of bloomfield i knew i needed to get a reservation but i had no idea how difficult that task would be we scheduled a dinner in october for the first available friday or saturday which was 6 months later that's right folks 6 months in advance the menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website we ordered earlier in the week so that maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal the menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on fridays during lent to have another option when we arrived we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment the appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs bread shrimp spinach pie stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible bring along your wine as merante's is byob the next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where maria cooks your meal at first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and maria imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends but maria did a great job of giving us our privacy we hardly even noticed that she was there after the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone) then the entrees and vegetables then the salad and last the dessert this was a meal fit for a king the portions were huge luckily maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day if your lucky you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience i would literally come here every month if it were possible unfortunately maria is booked through the end of 2014 not one day available in the next 8 months my only complaint maria is in serious need of a clone
1,was actually looking for absolutely beautiful large silk flowers and had searched high and low  what visiting from my home in austin my daughter in law suggested i try this shop  what a find  their flowers are top of the line as well as lovely little nice gifts for loved ones doesn't get any better than this
1,for my july wedding turned out gorgeous i'd highly recommend mt lebanon floral  (my bouquetscenterpieces were faith roses with cream hydrangea)
1,i received without question the most exquisite bouquet from toadflax my family had been through a lot this past month but this arrangement was so colorful so diverse so beautifully orchestrated that it absolutely brightened my day and lifted my spirits for the eveningi'm hesitant to add a photo as i honestly cannot get a shot that does these flowers justicethank you toadflax you've got my business for sure
1,love love love this store it's a mecca of kooky gifts books cards calendars tshirts jewelry candles pretty much everything you could ask for i've spent over an hour just browsing and around the holidays or birthdays it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get you can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of harry potter hardback books and don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches you'll be hard pressed to not buy anything before you leave
1,the kooky spelling kards unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift the card selection is extensive so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed even better there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself it's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles
1,a great store they stock everything (everything) including: cards hand puppets necklaces books etc kards unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale definitely my favorite store on walnut
1,regret to say that i have walked past this store for four years and never went in that's four years of gifts that i could have found in one place the books staionary gift wrap and kookyfun gifts are all instant inspiration they have way too many things to classify the store or its demographic but if you need something unique and have no idea of what it is just go in and look around you'll find it
1,the best card and gift store in the east end of pittsburgh if not the entire city  even the picky and indecisive card shopper (such as myself) can find plenty of good choices  need a present to go along with that card  you can make a one-stop trip to kards unlimited  there are toys for both kids and adults gag gifts like beer goggles books bath and body products ornaments and what is my favorite to look at funky jewelry  if you're shopping for a literary friend a bunch of the paper collage-style necklace pendants incorporate literary references (why yes i would like one)  even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd the jewelry is beautifulthe aisles can get cramped with people browsing but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see
1,have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back but i've usually come here to browse the books (lots of kurt vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like "while you were out" but with snarky commentary) not only do you have a ton of options here but they're very well curated options one of the very best gift shops around
1,more than just a card shop a very unique store tons of pop culture stuff take your time and look around
1,have to stop myself from stopping here once a week and stocking up on cards i don't yet need great card selection and perfect for gift shopping they literally have something for everyone  i go at least as often as i need a card for some occasion and they always have new things a bit expensive but worth it to support this great store
1,door sign reads "hiring enthusiastic energetic and humorous employees"  so i walk-in immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she "kinda likes it" i couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds i walked through the door super savvy humorous and fun: this is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up i left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk witty comic novels and an irresistible coin pouch it's more than shopping in here it's a whole experience go in get lots for awhile
1,of the few non-people i have purposefully sought out and "liked" on facebook kards unlimited has the highest quality and variety of cards i've ever seen plus wacky tees plus random crap usually found in gift shops at the airport only with infinitely more edge and non-bloated prices i always stop in for a visit when i'm wandering around walnut and i rarely leave empty handed
1,for pittsburgh greats gene kelly and billy strayhorn this historic theater is a real gem  originally the regent built in 1914 the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater dance music and film  i have been to several fundraisers hosted by the kelly strayhorn and they have always been first rate  also i recently attended the kelly strayhorn's own fundraiser full bloom which was lots of fun  as a venue this place is definitely worth your attention and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch
1,often mistake pict for community theatre - this isn't so pict as the name implies performs pieces of irish and classical theatre seasonally at the theaters of the university of pittsburgh in the stephen foster memorial (attached to the cathedral of learning) productions are top notch and often sell out so pittsburgh theatre lovers may find it worth it to buy a season pass
1,is one of the best theater companies in the pittsburgh area  the actors are so very talented and the play selections are smart thought provoking and relatively inexpensive  do yourself a favor and check out a performance  you'll definitely be back for more
1,hate to sound like a broken record but i have to agree with my fellow reviewers: pict is a wonderful theater and production group it makes me so proud to see the talent in this city whenever i attend one of their shows i guarantee you that if you check back each season you'll find at least one show to enjoy every year their line-up changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows i've seen a classics such as "antony and cleopatra" to the interesting (but potentially uncomfortable) "in the next room (or the vibrator play)" my outright favorite evening with pict was during a premiere of a play named "our class" which was an incredibly shocking but important play about sadly real events: a wwii mass murder of the jewish community living in a town in poland no one wanted to speak during or after that show and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well kudos to them and all of pict for tackling such an imposing but important projecti have plans to see at least one more if not two more pict performances this year; not once have they disappointed me and their contributions to the theater scene in this city are always outstanding thank you pict
1,have been a subscriber to the pittsburgh opera for 5 years  i have also attended the opera in other cities most notably new york city and sidney and i feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in pittsburgh  the season usually provides lots of variety and the artistic standards are very high  the benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building  the acoustics of the benedum are also really excellent  the super titles are easy to read from just about any seat  the orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully  i also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the pittsburgh opera
1,is a cabaret old chumyou may come out singing "life is a cabernet savignon" after throwing back a couple here because yay you can drink and eat and eat and drinki encourage anyone who loves musical theater (or anyone who just likes to eat and drink in a fun environment) to give this place a try  it's one of my favorite venue's to see a show because it's a whole experience  there's not a bad seat in the house because it only holds about 200 tables  plus they have vip seating in the front which provides you with some comfy sofa's to sit oni'm very excited to see a new caterer come in since the companion restaurant closed next door  i wasn't too thrilled with the food selectionsi really don't know how you make pizza badbut they somehow did  i loved the big bang and i love you you're perfect now change  they honestly do a fantastic job casting the shows  i have my own personal favorites it's my own personal fan club of onekeep in mind there's discounts if you work for certain corporations you're a student or you come a in group  everyone loves a discount  go see something so you can stop singing the same cabaret lyrics over and over again every time you think of the place
1,had an incredible night here my wife and i were "guests" meaning we had our ticket food and drink paid for this was really nice as we have  a 7 month old at home (amazing how fast they can burn through clothes)however i have to focus on the actual venue and production i can honestly say that my wife and i had a blast we thoroughly enjoyed the topic the performer the view from our seats and the food was very simple and tasty we encouraged many family and friends to go (some did and were equally impressed) which speaks to the impact the evening made on us i now keep my eye on what is happening at the clo and look forward to returning soonhighly recommend
1,have seen quite a few shows here and every one was a great time forever plaid ruthless dixie's tupperware party forbidden broadway to name a few always professional and enjoyable you can order food andor drink or just enjoy the show one recommendation: if you are "height-challenged" sit in one of the elevated rows in the back because the main floor is not sloped
1,came here to see the play "you say tomato i say shut up" and what fun we had the stage is visible from any seat the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying we really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking great time and we can't wait to come back for another show
1,have been to the clo cabaret for several shows and for salsa dancing and have had a great experience every single time  i love live theater and the clo offers a fun and unique alternative way to enjoy that experience  the seating is set up in such a way that there is not a bad seat in the house  along the sides you are seated in high bar tables the middle section is typical table seating and the back of the house is raised on a platform to allow for easier viewingmost of the shows at clo are small ensemble casts or only one or two actors  the way the room is set up you feel like you know them by the end of the show  the quality of the productions is fantastic  i've seen both plays and musicals and the acting staging and sets have been great for both  it is amazing what can be done through simple stage sets and props to bring the show to life  the only down side is that drinks are on the pricey side ($8-9 for a class of wine $10+ for a mixed drink)  however you are paying for the convenience of drinking while enjoying a show and the drink prices are pretty comparable to some of the other bars in the cultural district  i look forward to my next visit to clo
1,great intimate setting to see some local theatre i went to a performance of plaid tidings and really enjoyed the show you sit at tables rather than the usual side-by-side audience seating and can order drinks and food beforeduring the showthey have a small bar which seemed to get quite overwhelmed during intermission we had to wait a while to get a drink but there were a lot of people there all at once so that is bound to happenthe ushers and other staff were all very polite i was also impressed by some of their past shows they had displayed on the wall and would definitely go back for another show
1,are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in pittsburgh  this unique theater adds so much to the mix  it's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays usually with one musical in the mix there's new works here like the original show the chief about what else but pittsburgh steelers founding owner art rooney  they bring in the classics like a midsummer night's dream and the important of being earnest  they also have newer works right off broadway like the rabbit hole and superior donuts  plus they bring in second city every year which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple snl cast members i absolutely love the theater  i'm a big fan of a theater in the round  that means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage  they've also been able to do some really cool things with the stageset like making an actual pool for the show metamorphoses  my favorite all time show was the secret letters of jackie and marilyn which was a world premiere  the show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other  it was a very cool concept they also do a lot of great events like the mix at 6 for young professionals before a show  plus they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's they offer $15 tickets  the great thing is there's really not a bad seat in the house again we have a fantastic theater district so take advantage and go here  don't make me tell you twice
1,just saw superior donuts fantastic show with a really talented cast this show will definitely go down as a favorite of mine
1,cool theater  different in that it is modern but still located in the theater district  it's easily accessible and in a great location  probably the best aspect is the intimacy of the theater  only drawback is that any noise made can be heard a long ways  (ie be careful with children)i went to see electra thanks to yelp's culture month  the tickets were half price  can't be that  we were 6 minutes late oops but the box office was still able to give us our will call tickets and we were lead to watch the performance on a monitor until we could be taken inside  we were lead inside with 3 other couples while the show was going on  the only drawback was that we kind of had to just sit wherever (instead of our assigned seats) so as to not make much ruckusall in all fantastic performance and lovely theater
1,just saw "as you like it" here and we thoroughly enjoyed it the cast did a great job engaging the audience it was a long show (two and a half hours) but i was surprised afterwards that it didn't feel nearly that long and kept my attention throughout my only issue was the difficulty in understanding all of the shakespearean english but it was easy to follow the storylinei think our usher may have been having an off-night we were led to two wrong sections before we found our seats ourselves we have been here a few times and have will definitely be back for more
1,saw shakespeare's "as you like it" great performance
1,the austrailian pink floyd show 2 times and a doo wop show once place was built when everyone was 5'5 150 lbsi am 6'3 270 lbs so its a toyt squeese for a 2 hour concert but the sound and just the atmosphere makes me forget my knees are loc ated behind my ears red carpet on the walls makes me get all giddy betcha a cat would go ape in a place like this hope its open forever
1,is by far and away my favorite theater in pittsburgh if you've ever been here you know how beautiful it is it's a historic landmark and was built in 1927 and restored in the 80's to it's original state it holds around 2200 seats and is the third largest stage in the country as you can see i'm a total nerd about this theaterso let me give you some big insider tips about seating avoid at all costs the outer sides of the left and right orchestra (the floor) in the front you can actually get a cheap seat if you sit in the back of the left and right sides but only sit on the aisle if an aisle seat isn't available go for first or second tier i would rather see the show from far away than half see the show the touring broadway pittsburgh clo pittsburgh opera and pittsburgh ballet theatre perform here so go support our local theater just remember it's right here in the burgh it's still a fantastic production and it's cheaper than a trip to nyc
1,valentine's day date experience i decided to book tickets for the dracula saturday matinee so that we could have a night out on the town after the show this theater is really exquisite prepare to go back in time to the decadence of the 1920'smarble sconces crystal chandeliers staircases and brass railings adorn the beautiful space take some time after the performance to tour the interior roomsthe ballet was immensely enjoyable in it's own right the back drops dark sinister and ethereal all at the same time the dancers floating gracefully around the stage as if their feet fluttered just above the ground classical music flowed into the hall and moved with the performers during the most intense scenes it was so romantic i can't wait to go againpricing is quite reasonable too you can go for the cheap seats for $20 on the top tier left or right of the center $50 for better seating towards the center or orchestra seating for $90 being the best seat in the house i love that on the website you can choose your own seats parking can be found two blocks away for $5 at the parking garage take some time out to visit this theater
1,benedum center for the performing arts was originally a movie theater called the stanley it was built in 1927 and was billed as "pittsburgh's palace of amusement" it's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built 65 cents would not only buy you a "photoplay" but you'd also get live entertainment too a two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the us department of the interior brought it back to its original condition the grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater only one is a replica in fact the main chandelier weighs 4700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide the sightlines here are awesome it truly is a masterpiece of theater design let's face it fellow yelpers you're not here for my architectural reviews are you okay i came here last night for the decemberists concert featuring justin townes earle as the opener there were only single seats left when i tried to get tickets so i ended up going by myself to the show hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion the portland or based decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their cd "the king is dead" has been doing quite well so much so that it reached 1 on the billboard charts in late january the decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called "progressive rock" and british folk but this new cd is definitely more of an americanaalt country sound so much so that the single "down by the water" reminds me of firetown's "the good life" for some reason (firetown later evolved into garbage--in both senses of the word but that's another story) so it was no surprise that after doing "the crane wife parts 1-3" colin meloy told the audience "i don't know who wrote the set list but they thought we were a prog band we're not a prog band anymore we're a folk band" hmmm that actually was a pretty apt description despite this they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue there was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though sam watkins of nickel creek played fiddle against jenny conlee's accordion and they did a rousing irish jig to the song "rox in the box" it was almost strange though how meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song "rise to me" they also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show and face it folks you can't keep a good prog band down but anyway this show proved that the decemberists aren't some flash in the pan their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul i should also mention that my 60-something father a music fan in his own right absolutely loves the decemberists now you know where i get those genes from as i mentioned justin townes earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar it should his father is the iconic steve earle (another one of my favorites) justin gets his middle name townes from townes van zandt of whom steve earle was a great friend justin townes earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father
1,always love coming to the benedum  we attended wicked on a recent sunday night  i am always astounded by the beauty of this theater  here are a couple interesting facts:  the mirrors marble and woodwork in the grand lobby are all original  there are over 90 crystal chandeliers torchieres and sconces in the theater all but one are original  the original cost was $3 million back in 1928  compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million  we had perfect seats row aa  how lucky is that  loved the performance  my first time for wicked  but just as entertaining is the view of theater  love it here  so beautiful and so ornate  and while the seats are showing some signs of wear the good news is the 2881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450000you know it always feels really special here  no matter what event we attend  looking forward to coming back during the holiday season
1,phantom when it came through grew up seeing nutcracker every year jc superstar was awesome beautiful place and pittsburgh is soooo lucky to have it
1,love it here it is like walking into a little piece of history i could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day furs and fedoras and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways this is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares i have not experienced large playhouses in other cities but my advice is pick a show you love a decent broadway one splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience i don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view and unlike heinz hall you have a little leg room there are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint the ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (grrr that pittsburgh parking) speaking of parking i would park at the 9th and penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can i appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions i think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other american cities has been left to decay cue in detroit sadly so props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going true pittsburgh beauty
1,was lucky to get a tour of the benedum last month and i was completely impressed  this is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details  it is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical the opera ballet or a concert  the staff is amazing and extremely professional they run this place like clockwork  i love the natural acoustics of the building although i don't recommend that you sit under the balcony that's the worst place to hear a good sound  don't worry about getting over-dressed for an event at the benedum this is a truly unique and beautiful landmark that exudes elegance
1,theater  absolutely beautiful  live the seating  seen book of mormon here  loved it
1,guys and gals   as you know i am a volunteer usher at the benedum last night seinfeld       tonight celtic thunder   i highly recommend buying a season certificate or a package deal to the benedum next year is great "wicked"is the the featured attraction    what a great christmas or birthday gift right      do check into it and buy
1,seen several shows and have always enjoyed this venue here is the breakdown of the 5 stars given 1 star for location- smack dab in the middle of uptown- an easy walk from my apt a lot of restaurants are right there so it makes dinner and a show a convenient thing to do 1 star for staff- super friendly and helpful whether it's where is the will call line or where is the ladies room you'll always receive a polite response1 star for ladies rooms- i have waited before- but never long i also like that they have tv's situated everywhere so you don't miss any part of the show if you cannot wait for intermission1 star for seat comfort- roomy enough for me- miles above ovens arena in my opinion 1 star productions- they have great productions and always have a few each year on the line-up that are must-see's it does everything i need an arts center to do 
1,loved every venue under their umbrella ie booth playhouse belk theater knight theater and spirit square the shows are great and you can find some deals if you visit their website i've never had a bad time at one of their performances i did not have a good experience volunteering for them though but this is about arts & entertainment
1,is an awesome cozy venue  get on their email list and see everything they offer  hilarious plays (just saw every christmas story ever told last nightso funnythese people should really pay me to come and see their shows cause i laugh nonstop)  they also have cult classic movie nights (like gremlins  hilarious  and free)  decent wine and beer selections and prices  go to the website and hunt down the pwyc (pay what you can night) and you can have the chance to see the show for a discount  if you do this though remember it is first some first serve  so get there early around 6:30pm and grab a number when they call your number go and pay what you can (suggested contribution can be around ten bucks)  awesome spot
1,love this place  the shows can be hit or miss (more hits than misses for sure) but still worth it  it is a small cozy comfortable place that really cares about being local and celebrating that  they also have lots of fun shows do a free cult movie monday each month and have many specials  check them out for sure
1,love this place  i personally love musicals enjoy plays so my 1st encounter with atc was when they're showing the great american trailer park musical in august 2010  cmon people how can anyone pass that up  the performance was great  the stage is small which turns out to be one of the reason i like this place  there is not a bad seat  you can see everything  by the way seating is not assigned and 1st come 1st serve  on a hit show that can be a problem if you want to sit with your honey (or whoever)  get there early enough to get your choice seating  then i found out about the pay what you can night which is normally a wednesday  that night you will get to enjoy the same show for whatever you can scrap up from your couch (or $10 is suggested)  for people who are on tight budget (hmm me & lots of my friends) it's a great opportunity and i am very very appreciative of it  (check their website for pwyc date for each show)  drinks & snacks (aka chips & cookies) priced reasonably $3-5 for beerwine $1 for a snack pack  parking is free and plentiful in the lot next to the building  since then i've seen 39 steps (hilarious though i don't think that's the original intention) and every christmas story ever told (not growing up in the us i totally missed all the references so not as funny for me)  i am looking forward to pageant the musical
1,local i love this place and they have a special showing of all their shows i think at least once a month called 'pay what you can night'  that's just icing on the cake  i went here last night with my girlfriend and our friends and i wasn't really looking for anything fantastic in terms of talent or venue  boy was i surprised  maybe not so much in terms of the venue but the talent was superb  the staff and opening host of the show were super friendly  the place really has a grass roots feel to it and i love iti would suggest anyone to come check out a show here and support this local theater
1,best show in town right now to see is original rocky horror show they are doing the 1973 stage production which the movie was based on and it is fantastic this ain't your mama's rocky the music has a great deal of nuances that are amazing and the dancing is great there is always something happening on stage so i just went and saw it for a second time because i know there were things i missed and i was right
1,didn't know this theater existed until i went to see their run of the rocky horror show  it's a great pace with an intimate feel and a good seating layout  there really isn't a bad seat in the house (unless you have visionhearing problems)  the beer and wine selection at their concession has much more variety than i expected and their box office is a breeze to deal with  seriously how many times can you go see phantom  avoid the tired mainstream stuff and check out the edgy shows that atc is putting together  you won't be disappointed and you might even expand your horizons
1,is by far my favorite local theater i have seen several shows here (hedwig & the angry inch rocky horror show the clean house the pillowman and most recently chaps a jingle jangle christmas to name a few) i always love their performances and their selections keep me coming back over and overi have also been lucky enough to meet some of the staff through a mutual friend and can say that they have the nicest staff imaginable the theater's success is no doubt due to dan chip robert mike carrie and mailethe tickets and concession prices are more than reasonable but if you're on a budget check the website for their pay what you can nights for each production another favorite of mine is cult movie mondays the last monday of the month which is free with free popcorn next time you're looking for something to do with your evening check out what's playing it will definitely be worth your while
1,just wow i mean can we say wildly entertaining i'm not going to lie i didn't know what to expect a  bbc western christmas i mean really what the heck from the rick moranis honey i shrunk the kidstwo and a half men looking sound effect guy to the animated and monotone straight faced band and cute lead woman singer (and no i don't mean one the guy dressed like a wench) to supporting singing actors they were all amazing and entertaininggreat acting amazing voices and just a feel good all around good time these guys are pros
1,went on friday feb 10 2012 to see the production of "cuttin up"  i really enjoy the quaint atmosphere the people and the craft  the production was awesome mr randolph did a wonderful job  i hope to see more from him  i will definitely put this on my "to do list"  ~
1,was recently privileged to receive free tickets for myself and a friend to the play "the divine sister" courtesy of yelp elite  i have been a fan of actor's theatre for several years  a big plus for this location is free and easily accessible parking  it offers snacks and drinks for sale that one can take into the theatre  sometimes they offer beer and wine whose names compliment the theme of that evening's production  atc also features cult movie mondays in addition to plays and musicals  this evening's performance of "the divine sister" delivered the bawdy irreverent humor that is characteristic of this theatre  another success in a long line of accomplishments  thanks to ben and jj for orchestrating a fun and entertaining evening
1,charlotteans don't realize that we have such a fabulous ballet company in residence here in our fair city it is led by artistic director jean pierre bonnefoux and his wife patricia mcbride who are world renowned for dancing in the new york city ballet under george balanchine what does that mean for non dance connoisseurs it means young dancers want to come to ncdt from all over the world (literally) to dance under their tutelage which translates to a better experience for patronsncdt has always has a great reputation for modern contemporary ballets but they also excel at classic storybook ballets like romeo & juliet and funny children's ballets like cinderella but their sweet spot (and why they attracted resident choreographer dwight rhoden who you may have seen on so you think you can dance) is the innovative contemporary works in fact their annual innovative works in late fall often sells out it features several short pieces that often have a theme or message  my favorite piece satto was featured again recently in director's choice was originally an innovative work another one they debuted this year had two male artists partnering with anna gerberich and never let her feet touch the ground the whole time the artists and choreographers ebb and flow but you're always going to see a great show with a wide variety of styles you may not like every single piece but at least they're conversation pieces similarly you're not going to love every painting in the mint it's worth seeing something other than nutcracker so dive in the water's fineif i have any complaint it's that every dancer has a different stylestrength and jean pierre seems to have favorite principals that he sometimes over casts kind of like john foxi grew up watching such dance companies as the sf ballet bolshoi joffrey ballet odc alvin ailey and the cincinnatisan jose ballets so this ain't my first rodeoladies one more selling point in two words: eye candy glistening muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless i'm just saying sue me
1,must go see the ncdt i just saw the fall show limitless and it was incredible i have enjoyed ncdt for years but this performance was on a whole new level
1,great historic small concert venue  lot's of great bands play here  i saw weezer on their pinkerton tour with nerf herder (remember them the van halen song yes i'm that old)
1,guthrie henry rollins toots and the maytals are just a few of the bands on the line up this month it's a great place to see a band and they have good beers on tap too
1,barrymore is a great mid-size venue great sound good sight lines plenty of room to stand up front and to top it all off a ceiling of twinkling stars parking can be a little tricky but after going a few times you learn the side streets some bands i've seen here include stars bright eyes she & him jonny lang the mars volta and the yeah yeah yeahs - one of the most memorable shows ever because karen o was swilling from a bottle of champagne fell off the stage and managed to keep singing the entire time without missing a note or spilling a drop
1,love this place i really do no rail so front row is right on the stage the ambiance here is great and there's some cool bars and restaurants to hang at before the show waiting for a reason to come back (umphrey's)
1,and friendly staff  their fruit slush is especially good  it's sweet but not too sweet and the ice they put in there is like fine snow  we are all fans of the lychee watermelon and cantaloupe
1,i totally love this place i am happy now that i do not have to go all the way to chinatown for boba but sad that they don't have more than one locationi order mostly from their milk tea menu but sometimes get the slushies with milk too---it is not on the menu but you can definitely order it the fishballs are soooo good i ordered them not spicy but they still have somewhat of a tang to themthe staff is friendly and their service is speedy but it depends on how many people are there i have never found this place emptyyou gotta go herenote: don't forget to get a stamp card 10 stamps and you a get free boba :)
1,boba place make my jasmine milk tea like no other i live 15 minute away from easy life boba tea but if i get the craving then i will do what it takes to get to this heavenly place it's just that ubersuperwonderfullydelicious so worth my hard earn cash (and gas) so worth it periodps this is one of the rare boba shop that accept debit cards woaaah
1,been to easy life a good amount of times due to the fact that i work super close to it and i have never been disappointed by iti'm working my way through their menu today i had a banana smoothie that was very good not sure if i'd order it again though i believe it was made with whipped cream in it which left a weird texture in my mouthall the teas i've had so far have been really good aand you can get different types of toppings instead of just bobalike pudding balls or coconut jelly and one of these days i'm going to try the aloe vera they also have lobster and squid balls which are really interesting and worth a try
1,lady in green you have graced the sides of so many cups of coffee and tea -- i have been unfaithful  i was lead astray by those yelpers i've been hangin' with online and sweetheart let me tell you i'm not going to stop  today was just the firsti tried boba for the first time today at easy life and wow is it good  i have read the reviews on yelp for a few weeks now  since this isn't too far from home i was going to stop before but i'm always going tofrom somewhere and never did stopi got the coconut white tea with boba  this is absolutely delicious and i'm still enjoying it as i write this review  i was such a babe in the woods i didn't realize i needed the large tube strawthe women working the counter were quite helpful and helped lead me as i strayed from my green ladyi will be back  this is such a great drink for a day like today that has temperatures above 100thanks fellow yelpers  and it's all your fault that i was unfaithful
1,of my favorite places to get boba the location is great because it's in the southwest part of town open one in the northwest of town and i'll be even more happy there is a wide variety of different smoothies and teas you can topping like boba lychee aloe and more my favorite is the watermelon slush and green tea slush green tea slush with boba and aloe oh man it's so over they also serve finger foods which are really good but if you order spicy keep in mind they really mean spicy lobster balls are my favorite it is am must try if you never tried it before
1,frequent easy life boba anytime we are in the area andor really craving a delicious refreshing drink  i always get the same thing which is a peach slush they are great for hot summer days and nights here in vegas  i don't recommend hanging out there in the shop it is very hot in my opinion   maybe this is just due to the sweltering summer heatwho knows or by design to give extra incentive to get an ice cold drink once inside  either way don't let that persuade you not to try one  definitely a must try for all boba lovers out there
1,i loved my boba  they make a great almond milk tea and are pretty cheap  clean facility ample seating and even outdoor available seating for low humidity nights  they have available punch cardsi believe buy 8 get one free
1,to 5 stars - cannot find a better boba (or bubble tea as i used to call it)   and to include in my update:  lobster balls  what are these fried balls o'goodness exactly - i don't care  went for medium spicy and i like spicy - don't want to try the really spicy as am afraid i wouldn't get any of the lobster taste  great combo with the boba if you want a little bite to eat
1, my boyfriend and i stopped in tonight for "dessert" after dinner  i got the thai tea slush and he got the coconut milk tea  i kinda wish i would have gotten the largei was sad when it was gone :(
1,spot has to be my favorite place to get boba out here you would think somewhere in china town would have really good boba but not so muchas much as i hate parking at town square and just being there in general i make it a point to stop here whenever i want boba and i know there won't be too much traffic [another plus point - it's right by sephora]its a small kioskstand in the center of town square service is always great even when they're busy however the last time i was there she made a small slush instead of a large [good thing i kept my receipt] she made another one for me right away so it wasnt that big of a dealabsolute favorites here - watermelon slush [they use real watermelon not the fakey syrup] and hawaiin sunset
1,is by far the best boba in town (unless told otherwise) but i love the original milk tea with boba and lycee jelly (light on the ice please)
1,friendly service
1,love lollicup  why can't one move to honolulu  they make the best peach iced tea ever  from now on whenever i go to vegas i will be sure to stop by lollicup and buy the biggest sized drink
1,place for a boba fix great milk tea with decent price drinks have the right amount of ice and syrup comparing to other boba places (which give u almost a whole cup of ice with either too much or too less syrup) location is central in town square and easy to stop by pick up a drink and continue shopping or whatnot workers are friendly and drinks don't usually take too long to be made and served overall if you are looking for a quick boba fix lollicup is the place to go
1,been here about 5 times already and every time the boba was really delicious i'm totally pushing the fresh watermelon slush  right now it isvery refreshing and delish
1,had some items here that i would easily have seconds on lately it's their watermelon cooler frozen watermelon all blended up and frozen fresh watermelon too i've seen them hauling a bunch of em in by hand good stuff for summer or whenever you need some tasty smoothies
1,place if you need youre boba tea fix always hits the spot
1,time i'm at town square i go and get a honey milk tea with boba   so yummythe prices are a bit much for the size of the cup but its that good yes  its really that great  some time there is a line for all the tourests but it can be fun to just sit and people watch as you sip pure pleasure
1,only place i go to for quality boba tea they're friendly and the place is a great place to hang out
1,just visited this super fun frozen yogurt shop today and i am totally in love  it is self-serve frozen yogurt that you add your own toppings to  they have a bunch of flavors to pick from so you can mix and match  they also have loads of fresh fruit chocolate sprinkles and even mochi & red bean paste to put on your delish frozen yogurt  after you pick out everything you want they weigh it and charge you per ounce  it is a really fun place to go and it tasted greati had pineapple mango and strawberry fro-yo topped with fresh pineapple mango coconut mochi and kiwi  a word to describe  scrumdiddlyumptious
1,am far too obsessed with this place it has cute seating and the yogurt is delicious i mostly veer towards the originalcalifornia tart and green tea i top with blueberries (antioxidants) mango kiwi mochi andor shredded coconut beware of the large cups and the desire to fill the entire thing after the first time i learned my lesson and now i usually leave with a $2-$3 cup of yogurt that satisfies completely
1,flavors great toppings i always stick to the "tart" flavors plain california mango etc and usually get mine topped with fruit the only thing i don't like is that it's "self-serve" so many people not washing their hands touching the machines etc ahh well  the tart frozen yogurt is delicious and a healthy addiction the prices are high too but that's typical of other tart fro-yo places; apparently the mix is pretty expensive compared to the 80's style fro-yo
1,frozen yogurt huge selection of flavors and toppings  the best part is that it is self-serve; so you can have as little or as much as you like as few or as many toppings etceverything is sold by weight ($047oz)  a very reasonably sized bowl ended up being about $5i wish they had one of these in ames ia
1,fro-yo huge selection of toppings and just the right ammount of different flavors to try from
1,i have been to a lot of froyo places in chicago the suburbs and even out of the states  let me tell you nothing beats cocomero  the best part about this place is that it's self-serve with fresh variety of toppings  the design of this place is pretty nice it seemed like a picture out of an ikea catalog  i wish my university had this lucky for uofi students they can get it anytime
1,been to a similar concept store in wheaton this place seems pricey (some $047 per ounce) like that one but the sheer amount of flavors and toppings is overwhelming compared to other stores like iti had a lactose-free mango frozen yogurt and some pomegranate-based yogurt both were very good and i had no complaints about them there were many other flavors available including the oddly-named "european tang"the toppings included yogurt chips mochi () a brownie very fresh fruit (yes the mango was ripe) and more the store design is very bright very pastel and very smart i might just be back here tomorrow if i'm craving more frozen yogurt hopefully i can try some of the more chocolately or crunchy toppings next time
1,my recent trip to california i made it a point to get to two froyo places - pinkberry and yogurtland  despite liking the tartness of pb's original flavor it just couldn't match up to the variety of flavors toppings and the cheap pricing of yl  unfortunately from what i had heard the only other froyo place with the "by-the-weight" model in chicago was pretty badi've known about the one in champaign for a while but i'd never goneperhaps due to a fierce loyalty to jarling's custard cup and the moonstruck that cocomero replaced  but as a lover of froyo i had to see what the fuss was aboutfellow yelpers yogurtland has come to the midwest  tons of flavors tons of toppings cheap price and super happy decor  and most importantly - it's good  especially the red velvet froyo  my friends described my reaction as if i had just saw the love of my life  in-freaking-tense  i'm happy i have a custard cup alternative to go to if i visit uiuc in the colder months
1,so good i go to school about 45-60 minutes away and i drove all the way to champaign for this ok well i went shopping toococomero is diy frozen yogurt and i love that concept there are a ton of different flavors pick one or mix and match they will also give you taster cups which are really hard to eat yogurt from i don't get it once you have your yogurt go to the topping bar and choose what you want they have all kinds of fruit nuts and candies i recommend mochi :) then you weigh your creation and pay by the ounce ($47oz i believe) sit down or take it to go yum
1,been to about a dozen different froyo places and i still use cocomero as my gold standard nothing beats this place the vast variety of flavors the great taste the decor the price -- everythingi'm dying to head back to chambana just so i can get a mere spoonful of my peach flavored froyo you would not believe how difficult it is to find that flavor anywhere else let alone some of their other ones such as kahlua and bailey's irish cream see what i mean by vast variety of flavors no one else comes close
1,tea available here
1,hot summer day and a nice cool fresh pearl drink it doesn't get better than this it can be tough to find real bubble tea that isn't made from that nasty powdered stuff; i have a hard time even amongst the plethora of places in the bay area jade mountain's bubble tea is top notch quality made from actual tea with love and fluffy fluffy frothiness on the top yum
1,good bubbleboba tea red is my favorite they also have stella's bakery scones and spicy cheese bread can't wait until winter to try hot bubble tea
1,here and tried not to get excited im from california and i know good boba when i drink itafter my first sip i was immediately satisfied with my green milk tea with bobathe tea at this place is taiwanese style which is better then hong kong style in my opinion now if only they can add their famous fried chicken and butter toast to their menuword of advise i like my tea not too sweet and the one they made was perfect for me however it is usually a lot sweeter so if you have a sweet tooth ask for more syrup
1,ordered a black milk tea for under 3 bucks which it's totally reasonable price it tasted pretty goodyou can tell it's made fresh with real tea - none of that powder crap it's not as richcaffeinated as hk style milk tea (what i'm used to in the bay area) but i would definitely come back here to satisfy my milk tea craving very comfortableclean seating area and the cashierowner is very polite (handed my change back with both of his hands) too bad it's so far away
1,food drinks and environment love the bubble tea and potstickers
1,mountain is a great little place and i'm really happy to have it in my neighborhood i've only ever had their bubble teas but they are quite delicious quite often then tapioca bubbles have just been freshly prepared and recently i've noticed that they have other options like lychee jelly for that matter it seems like every other time i go back there is some kind of new tea flavor or variety on the menuon top of the tasty drinks the staff is always super friendly and the environment is relaxed and comfortable great place to hang out on a lazy sunday
1,place is great the prices are super reasonable and the tea is just how i like it-- not too sweet with great tea flavor i wish i lived in madison so i could get bubble tea here all the time it's a great place to hang out for a bit; you can get your drink in a glass if you want to drink it while you're there the owners are really friendly
1,milk teas are perfect very subtle flavors with just the right amount of sweet and milkiness to tea ratio i think they blend their teas rather than shake but it comes out tasting smooth refreshing and cool i also appreciate they keep their indoor temperature at normal levels who wants to be ice-blasted by the air-con i can actually wear a t-shirt inside rather than have to bring a sweater with me on a hot summer day or i can sit outside on their cute furniture with my cool drink they're a bit of a ways from campus but whenever i'm in the area i try to stop by and support this unique find in wisconsin
1,cannot possibly say enough nice things about this place  their bubble tea is delicious - real tea lightly sweetened tapioca pearls; sweet and refreshing and never cloying  i particularly recommend the red milk bubble tea  i've tried bubble tea other places since jade mountain opened but nothing else comparestheir chicken and pork pot stickers are perfect snack food and the pork ramen is excellent - better than umami's at half the price  they have a tendency to run out of the various food items on the menu but there's usually an equally good alternative availablethrow in friendly staff casual atmosphere good prices wifi and a rewards program and jade mountain is well worth my commute from the west side
1,can't stress enough how great this place is  i've been coming here regularly since i discovered it last winter and will continue to do so the first thing i noticed about this place was their great customer service  the workers are always friendly - especially the owners - and you can tell that they try to get to know a lot of their regular customers  they're also very helpful in answering any questions about the teas and can give recommendations  thumbs up on the milk tea mountain tea (a really unique and great taste) coffee and the fruit teas  the little desserts are a nice touch and the one i've tried was good  their steamed buns are good as wellthe only thing i wouldn't recommend is the pork ramen  my friend and i both tried it and neither of us liked how fatty the pork was  the ramen is okay but i probably wouldn't order it again for the price  but overall i find their prices to be very reasonable
1,first i thought bosa had only in a couple locations in the valley but after we moved to central phx i've realized that bosa has become a dynastyi have always had a passion about donuts even when i was at my peak health there was room for donutsbosa just does it right the cinnamon crumb is clearly the best donut but even the cake donuts rock (please dont' make me regret recommending this flavor leave one for me from time to time friends)coffee is usually quality and black as night the dunkin's in the area seem to have a real problem with consistency but not the case w bosai too look forward to trying their take on boba tea but it's gonna be hard to beat the streettake it from a guy who could put away a dozen donuts but has the will to eat just one at a sitting why waste your calories on crappy cakes candies etc donuts are the way to go
1,like the box says best doughnut in town  can't stop thinking about the apple fritter i had  very friendly staff to top it off
1,best donuts i've ever had
1,opened one by my house and u wish they hadn't these ate the most delicious donuts i have ever tasted  i want to eat them everyday  friendly staff good prices and soooo very addicting
1,donuts boasts the best donuts i've ever had they are so good you cannot just eat one by far the softest and tastiest donuts around
1,drive-thru boba how can this be a bad thing well it just so happens that it can't thai iced tea taro and honeydew too this place is the best the lady who runs the counter is very nice and the donuts are delicious stopped in for a honeydew melon boba and a ham and cheese croissant and my kids spent the next hour munching quietly on donut holes which was just a reward in itself the prices are cheap the service is friendly and i will take bosa over krispy kreme and dunkin donuts any day of the week also an fyi ignore the bosa website - this location does not serve kolache's and they have their own hours which i believe are 5am-10pm every day
1,fresh and great tasting donuts  wonderful customer service  believe it may be family owned  a regular stop for us  by far the best donuts in phoenix
1,found bosa after an amazing meal at becketts table i know what the hell am i doing going across the street after a huge meal well with experiences at great donut places in texas i have always wondered where the great donut place is for azbosa donuts is that place they carry all the classic donuts and you won't be let down these are not like the large chain donut places bosa donuts are always fresh whether you are there at 6:00am or midnight yes i know bosa donuts is the donut place in phx
1, simply the best apple fritter i've ever had in my life  and cheapstrong coffee  you've been warned :)
1,over krispy kreme bosa has the best donuts i have ever eatenyou have to try the creme filled ones too a customer brought some in for my employees and i have been thinking of them ever since my employees have too found the address and am driving across town  to get some morethey must use all the ingredients of the old days to taste this good
1,stated: best bubble tea available in madison right now  bubbles are just right rest of the recipe is just right - they even have the little machine to seal the cup  perfect
1,been looking for a good bubble teaexotic fruit smoothie place since i left chicago and steepery tea bar met all my expectations fast and friendly service plenty of flavor options and delicious drinks i'll definitely visit again
1,bubble tea in madison above average compared to other places with more bubble tea shops
1,love this place i came here all the time the staff is always really friendly and even when there really busy i have never had to wait long for my drink to be made
1,tea bubble tea bubble tea bubble tea(can you tell i love bubble tea seriously it's like a drink and a snack all in one) i first tried bubble tea at bubble island in university squareeast campus mall and since that went south i've been searching for bubble tea and then steepery came and i found it of course there are other things to love about steepery too - mainly the multitude of flavors they offer as add-ins where else in the central downtown area can you get a lavender chai latte also steepery's refreshingly tech-savvy for a local shop - they've got an ipad cash register belly rewards app wifi all that fun stuffonly thing i don't like (and this may have changed since the last time i was there) no gift cards instead they do it by pots of tea - you can buy 10 pots 20 etc i'd prefer a traditional dollar-amount gift card option if they haven't started doing it alreadyedit: five stars five stars - they do sell gift cards thanks owner nick for clearing that up for me :)
1,had to stop a group of asians in the middle of a cross walk because i saw boba in their hands the people who works here were mad friendly and they gave me a great suggestions probably the best in wisconsin i would say
1,tasting bubble tea options super friendly staff  and right atmosphere for state st highly suggest
1,guava green tea with pearls today :) not a huge fan but still pretty good flavor my favorite is still the jasmine tea latte with pearls they just have the best pearls here and there is no way to resist lol
1,the only place in the world i have been where i can get hot milk tea infused with red bean and mung bean flavor heaven
1,great bubble tea and my favorite shake is the pumpkin chai shake which is limited time every year sooo good and made with real pumpkin
1,is semi new they've been open for at least the last month or so but it seems no one has really come out and checked it out it's located on ft apache and tropicana to the left of tropical smoothie or mashisoyo the sign says "grand opening homemade ice cream and boba" it doesn't have a name on the signs yet so it's hard to see it all the ice creams are all homemade and made right there in the shop the prices are not bad at all for a single scoop it is $250 double scoop $350 and every extra scoop is another $1 they have many flavors if you look at my picture you can sort of see the menu (i'll update a little later) the asian flavors are what stuck out to me the most they allow free sampling of the flavors so yes i did try them all and actually liked all of them one flavor that's not on the menu itself is durian but if you ask for it they'll give it to you now this was the first time i ever had durian and it was delicious (now i have to try the actual fruit) i've heard it was either a hit or miss with durian as some people really hate it or really love it the flavors aren't imitation which you can easily tell after taking a bite into it i haven't tried the vegan ice cream yet but it's non-dairy and it's worth a shot if you're lactose intolerant or vegan they have waffle cones  bowls which is only an additional 50centsthey have milk tea slush and hot tea which all the prices are very fairthey have a stamp card for the boba drinks buy 5 get one 1i'm not going to take off for service but i've had some bad run-in's with their service owner going on vacation and they close but when asked for a return date they either don't know or give me the wrong date as i love the ice cream i came back several times when they said they were going to be open to bring my mother who is visiting from out of the country and they weren't open or were rude the owner while he was working did not acknowledge me at all while in the store only acknowledged my friend which was rather rude but i'm willing to give him another shot if i based this review off of service i would only give them 1 star as it was a major disappointment but alas the ice cream is well worth it to me
1,love all the asian flavors that they have especially durian ice cream their ice cream is freshly made at the store and the owners are exceptionally friendly they offer samples and do not get annoyed when you want to try multiple samples in addition to all their wide variety of flavors they are also one of the few places that offer vegan ice cream too currently they have vegan vanilla chocolate and mango they are open to making more flavors if there is a demand for them i love supporting our local small businesses d
1,aside the fact that when i first went they had some bad impressions (owner on vacation closed shop for over a week no ingredients to make ice cream to replenish stock etc) if i based the review on that only i'd probably give them 1-2 stars but i gave them many chances to recoverlocated on the sw corner of tropicana and ft apache next door to tropical smoothie (take note the address from yelp on more than one occassion has led the person to the area down the street) easy way to get to this place would be turning right at the hobby lobby sign on ft apache and then taking a left i had first heard about this place from a friend saying they had durian ice cream i was ecstatic to hear this news and been waiting a long time to try this place there are 3 different "areas" of ice cream first is the normal type containing like chocolate banana chocolate pistachio etc second is the asian type containing green tea lychee taro black sesame ginger mango durian and guava last but not least something catered to the lactose intolerant 100% non-dairy ice cream with flavors of i believe vanilla chocolate and mango all the ice cream is made by the owner himself peter wong he lets you try as many flavors as you want and he gives you a decent amount (way more than other places for samples) something good to note is all the ice creams are not overly sweet they are sweet but very fragrant all of the ice cream are soft and very smooth i've tried most of the asian flavors including some of the normal and one of the non-dairy style starting by my favorite type asian flavors  my least favorite is probably the ginger there is a slight spice from the ginger that you can taste nothing spicy but its like a subtle but noticeable spice the taro is one of the lighter ones as well fragrant  light with very small taro bits no artificial coloring (not deep purple like you see in stores but like very very light purple)the mango and lychee are nice sweeter but fragrant depending on the fruit the guava (new) is nice really fragrant not too sweet out of the "ordinary" asian flavored ice cream the last two is black sesame and durian (so i just noticed ive never tried green tea hmm) first the black sesame made with actual ground black sesame very fragrant slightly sweet its like the ice cream version of the hot black sesame soup dessert i love it  and last but not least durian be warned this is one of the asian fruits where you either will love it or hate it it has a very distinct flavor and smell this is my favorite along with the black sesame the durian has a light yellow color gives off the actual durian fragrance that you'd expect from the fruit same for the taste as well very fragrant slightly sweet as for the normal flavors i havent had the chance to try yet ive been stuck on the asian flavors but when i visited today peter let me try a new creation of his which was the banana chocolate chip he said its made with real bananas  this flavor was really fragrant in terms of the banana not too sweet either honestly almost rather prefer it without the chocolate chip the chocolate chip makes it kind of weird now last but not least something a lot of places dont offer 100% non-dairy ice cream when i had first visited this place my uncle was complaining about not being able to try any because of his lactose intolerance luckily peter just created (that day) something new 100% non dairy ice cream my uncle was super happy peter was very careful made sure to not use a scoop that was prior used in the other ice creams as i had said earlier there was 3 flavors he had made when he was getting a sample for my uncle he said the ice cream was made earlier and has not completely set yet but because its been maybe 1-2 hours since freezing process started there are some areas he was able to get that was solidified i forgot which flavor was tasted but the texture and flavor was good of course its not as fragrant as if using normal dairy products but it was still good for what it is flavorful semi sweet and of course smooth highly recommended place for ice cream prices are very good as wellstarting at $250 for 1 scoop up to $550 for 4 scoops they aren't small scoops either  :d
1,took two attempts to come out here before i was able to try perfect scoop give them a call before you head over besides the after school crowd their business is not steady throughout the rest of the day and they tend to close early the second note; they make all of their ice creams fresh and will run out of the fun ones i had my heart set on durian or black sesame but both flavors were out instead my sister and i shared the pink guava and lychee both these light and sweet fruits complimented each other well we ended up taking a little of both in each bite if a bolder flavor was paired with either their subtle characteristics would have been maskedall of their flavors are made in house with no added colors or preservatives the scoops are generous the staff are warm and gracious all of these components made the disappointment of not getting what i came for bearable just call ahead of time to see if they are open and fully stocked
1,i'm going to tell you exactly why i gave this place 5 stars1star: customer service the filipino lady working here is pretty awesome i came in with 3 other friends and of course we asked for samples :p she pretty much gave us a scoop of all the flavors that we wanted to try honestly we could've had our fill from just the samples but they were just too freakin good she was patient and took the time to chat with us which i really appreciated2star: flavors this is no ordinary ice cream shop with your typical vanilla chocolate its exotic by exotic i mean pink guava black sesame durian taro lychee mango green tea etc etc no where else in the las vegas valley have i found these flavors at an ice cream shop annnnnddd all are hand made by the owner what i liked most about it was that all the flavors weren't overly sweet you mainly got the flavor 3star: price cheap cheap cheap 1 scoop was about $250 and the prices go up from there they also offer waffle bowls and other toppings and you can also get a pint to take home for less than $5 bucks thats freakin awesome4star: atmosphere though the shop is small there are table and chairs the lady honestly didn't mind us sitting for half an hour just chatting in fact she even came and chatted with us i can definitely see this as a hang out spot to meet with friends over some ice cream and boba especially during the summer time 5star: just because i feel like it they are greatplease don't let this place die this ice cream shop needs to stay open forever** my favorite was the black sesame
1,best black sesame ice cream ever i had a scoop there and wanted a pint to go unfortunately there was only enough for one more scoop so i took it
1,place is amazing one of the best impressions of a place from the beginningthe lady that works there is so nice and even opened the place early (an hour before it was supposed to open) when we were waiting outside to realize that it wasn't opened yet in addition she gives samples if you ask to try and she doesn't gip you off the samples either she lets you try what you want and is very patient and welcoming the asian flavors are so unique probably the only place i know that makes such interesting flavors from durian pink guava black sesame green tea lychee mango red bean ginger to taro what is even more special is that the lady that works there along with her business partner make the ice cream themselves you can definitely taste the different of homemade ice creamthe price is really good deal for the portion one scoop is 250 two scoops 350 and a pint for 450 i generally am against having anything durian due to its smell however if you get past the first 'impression' of the durian ice cream it is really good it has the durian ice cream with a mix of vanilla ice cream i think i had tried it during the sample and decided order it as one of the scoops of twoblack sesame is by far my favorite there if you have had the chinese sesame balls in sweet soup it taste exactly like that except in cold form it is creamy and not too sweet like other ice creams and if you are person who likes ginger candy or like the taste of ginger ginger flavor is definitely a must-try it does have a strong ginger flavor like durian ice cream however if you can get past that first impression it has a rather soothing aftertastealso if you are a person who doesn't want to try the asian exotic flavors they do have many other flavors to tryfurthermore this place is really cozy and the owner was willing to let us hang out there and catch up with friends the lady that worked there even came up to us at one point to chat with us last but not least this place is not just for ice cream they do sell various drinks as well definitely will come and try other flavors here again
1,eats ice cream in the dead of a vegas winter i do and i'll keep coming back for more all year round props to mr wong for making such delicious ice cream flavors with fresh ingredients especially the asian ones love that they have the typical green tea lychee mango taro and red bean but the ones that stand out is the black sesame ginger and the infamous durian coming from someone who almost kicked a friend out of the car for drinking a fresh durian smoothie i have to say that their durian flavor is the only exception i'd make for the spiky smelly fruittheir prices are so reasonable given the small mountain of ice cream they give you dishing out the $350 for two huge scoops is a bargain given how they make the ice cream in house you could get a pint here for $450 and it'd be better than the stuff at the asian marketsthe filipina lady seriously reminds me of my mom (in a good way i promise) friendly generous and personable she served up a sample equivalent to a whole scoop of all the requested flavors for my three friends and i to split not only that but she was genuinely interested in getting to know us too almost felt like i was at home there how often does that happen these daysyou might get brain freeze while enjoying their cheap chilly treats but trust me you won't get the cold shoulder here
1,tried their "non-asian" flavors and perfect scoop is still pretty solid tried killer chocolate and espresso during my second visit and damn it's freakin' frackin' good i'm itching to come back and try their ginger flavor i don't even care if it's 40-30 degrees out the cold won't stop me from devouring their ice cream i know they offer other stuff like boba drinks but for now i plan on trying all of their ice cream flavors i'm glad a business like this exists here in the valley i love privately-owned establishments compared to chains the attention to detail and quality is definitely better the filipina lady is charming and very accommodating just like jaimie y said she reminds you of that aunt (or in her case her mother) that is willing to feed you whenever you come to visit or something not to mention they have vegan ice cream i'm not strictly on a vegan diet but this option is quite nice
1,got to try a lot of different flavors as i kept going back i tried all their asian flavors i'm not a fan of the ginger it's a little spicy and not what i expect from ice cream but they added ginger candy into the ice cream which has a nice flavor the taro was light i couldn't really taste much of the taro in it but it was still good and fragrant the guava was good too it was made from pink guava really light in color but really good i loved it enough to take some home the green tea is good too tastes a lot better then the ones you find in other stores or prepackaged ones tastes just like the ones i find in japan black sesame is sweeter then the rest at least to me it is but it's still really good the regular flavors i've tried a bunch of them and they're all good not so sweet as i would find american ice cream to be but there is still a sweet sense to them all one that stood out was the banana chocolate chip but i don't like the added chocolate chip to the banana ice cream but it's still good i would actually like to see just banana ice cream by itself
1,where do i start the most moist fresh and fluffy donuts i've ever had at all times of they day you'll find fresh donuts here staff is super friendly this shop is the real deal and a must go for donut enthusiast
1,donuts
1,man az donut co is the best worst thing to ever happen to me these donuts are by far some of the best in the valley (especially when you get them fresh) and they're right down the street from my house so well i'm a regular now and i eat far too many donuts
1,are several great aspects to this company first i'll start with the downfall because i can only think of one the wait at the drive-through is extremely long it could be sped up quite a bit because it doesn't actually save time from what it would take to park and walk in i was the only customer in the drive-through after placing my order i spent about 5 minutes waiting at the window -- longer than expected but tolerablehowever on the plus side there's a drive-through  although it may take less time to just park and walk inside the benefit of having a drive-through is that you don't have to get ready in the morning or late at night the drive-through and shop are open 24 hours a dayhow many more ways can i say "amazing"next - i love boba tea and usually have to drive 20 minutes to chandler for a decent one from boba tea house in lee lee's market place complex not anymore this place also sells my favorite taro milk tea finally not only was the staff extremely friendly (almost overly friendly but in a positive way) the donuts are delicious and fresh -- i'd recommend this place over the big chains (dunkin donuts krispy kreme) any day extremely cheap but be aware: they will not accept credit or debit cards for purchases under $3  5 stars in my book
1,two data points--old fashion and glazed crumb the former was excellent the latter fantasticgotta get back
1,donuts and best price in town
1,sweet late night heavenlocated where the old kfc used to be on broadway and beck across from palo verde this place is a late night dream their drive thru is open 24 hours i rolled thru and was actually taken aback by their extensive menu after a few minutes of debating w myself i decided on the vanilla cake and boston creme the lady who was working the window was probably the nicest person ive ever dealt w at a drive thru she seemed genuinely happy to be there in minutes i had my donuts and was on my way homeand they were go-od cakey and gooey and delicious and *homer simpson drool*dont be surprised if they dont have the vanilla cake when you go in i was told they run out of it all the time
1,drive by it all the time on my way to work so last friday i stopped in the staff was super friendly which is a stark contrast from the fast food joints i usually get iced coffee from i ordered a ham and cheese croissant combo the price with an iced coffee was cheaper than any fast food place and the doughnut holes yummy it has that mom and pop feel and the staff was perky
1,found out about donut co through an admenu and decided to make a midnight run i noted it was within relatively easy biking distance of the asu campus which was exciting since i've been looking for a donut shop that can fit that distinction i asked my friends to choose which donuts they wanted off of the menu i found and despite the late hour at which i went there was an ample amount of each kind to pick fromthe donuts themselves were soft and tasted fresh particularly the donut holes i didn't heat them up when i got back since my friends didn't have a microwave in their dorm room but i'm sure they would have tasted even better warm and better than their donuts was their boba tea the special signifier for my 5 star ratingi went for a taro flavored boba smoothie which i've had before at other boba tea establishments while i usually enjoy taro smoothies the way they prepared theirs made it possibly one of the most delicious things i've ever had the pleasure to drink the taste was akin to the scent of a pumpkin spice candle but in creamy purple smoothie form they didn't skimp on the tapioca either absolutely perfect drink even on my chilly bike ride back to my dorm cannot recommend this place enough for fans of boba teathe cashier was friendly and attentive particularly for a late-night employee absolutely wonderful shop
1,very well might be the best donuts in the phoenix area  great price helpful and happy service  great variety (even though i arrived at 4:30 pm) and all items were light fluffy delicous fresh and not too sweet  worth every bite
1,local place to go for bowling and enjoy time with friends and family summer time is nice to sit out on the patio have a few drinks with friends and watch some volleyball
1,were trying to find somewhere cheap with some decent food in the madison area after reading some not so great reviews we decided on this promising joint it was a short drive from where we wanted to head afterwards and they're cool with you leaving any cars in their parking lot for any amount of time even overnightthe bar was definitely top notch especially for a bowling alley the food was fantastic  great sandwiches and burgers appetizers and more variety than you'd expect from a venue of this sort fast friendly service topped it all off bowling is super super cheap on mondays and most weekdays standard fare as that goes; plenty of lanes and balls to choose from and to those who make a big deal about them borrowing a shoe grow up highly recommended for some fun with friends or just a few drinks
1,go for the bar food and people can't say i have bowled there but i do frequently visit it's a good bar to stop in and just relax for a bit patio is nice in the summer time plenty of room to just relax with friends or family the staff keeps me coming back kitchen can be hit or miss depending on who's cooking but for the most part your bartenders will work with you enjoy some darts pool volleyball or some bar dice overall since i moved here it is like a hidden gem that reminds me of home defiantly worth a visit
1,instructors and staff
1,had my wedding here they were great we had correspondence throughout the entire planning phase however they don't offer many services for weddings we had to find our own dj photographer officiant ect however they cater there so we had limited choices on what we can choose from there is no way to taste test the food prior to your selection either same for the cake they make them there but they only offer whipped cream frosting and fresh flowers to put on top bring your own topper and ribbon to put around the cake as well i had my wedding upstairs where the lighting is not to good either but i have to say my friends and family loved the place they are still telling me on how that was the best and most fun wedding they have ever been to so for the price this place is the best but be prepared to do quite a bit of the work yourself its not an all inclusive package like you can get at some other places around the valley but to do it all over again i would still pick this place
1,used to go here up until i was seven years old then my family moved to bostonfirst the wave pool is completely amazing to a little kid growing up in arizona a kid who may have never seen waves before and the waterslide was scary as hell but awesome when i got up the nerve to go down itand then there are the ducks around the manmade arizona pond i loved all those ducks and one time this duck let me put him on his lap and i pet him and he just stayed there i looked for that awesome duck each time i went back to the park afterwards but never found him again
1,glad tempe has an area like this a few miles down mill and you feel like you're in another town nothing but green everywhere and waterlove itwent to the batting cages for $125 you get 14 pitches you got poolslakebasketballtennis courts you can even pay to join games i believejust an all around cool place for some physical activities and cheap at that
1,in the fitness center was a treat to work with he cared about making fitness a lifestyle habit and something you could continue with long term the gym itself is nice plenty of circuit and cardio equipment as well as some free weights what made it five stars though was suk checking in on you in your workout when she was around  thanks
1,every penny it's so nice to be able to swim without being out in the heat i have a pool and still go here a couple times a week be careful with small kids though the waves pack a punch
1,to family & friendsif you are in tempe you must visit kiwanis park this is such a beautiful park not only is it beautiful family and friends would love it here for the weekend fun or holding an event my first visit was when the boyfriend and i visited his house located in tempe and walking distance to the park i fell in love with the park there's a lake and a long sidewalk for runners out there best weather to run would be during the fall in the evening apparently it's still warm during the fall here no surprise since we're talking about arizona desert state right hahawhat will catch your eyes the lake who would imagine desert like arizona would have water i didn't haha great place to bring your kids and family here on the weekends of after your meals just to walk around and breathe what caught my eyes were the sign that says 'crossing ducks' http:wwwyelpcombiz_photoscsvmqusncacvhschoba1ggselectfek9gkxnbvigdqlp-fasfwfek9gkxnbvigdqlp-fasfw made me smile :)take a look at the website : http:wwwtempegovindexaspxpage774there's many activities you can do with your family and friends oh my did i mention there's a wave pool inside of the recreation center you heard me wave pool how cool is that :d there's also a fitness center (might need to be a member) tennis court volleyball (my favorite) batting cage and some rentals (ask them for specific rentals) seriously can spend a day here make sure to watch your children if you are walking near the lake because there is no barrier keep your kids by your side just for safely there are ducks and probably random fishes in the lake you can fish at the lake but i wouldn't suggest to take the fishes home to eat d: so glad this park is just 5 min walk from his place in arizona will come back maybe next time i'll bring my dog :)
1,really knew how amazing this park is it is a mecca of fun and good timesthey offer so much here it is hard to cover it allthey have a great little man made water way inside on the mill ave side it is a giant pondyou can take little water crafts on it  it has ducks and fish as well they also have a lot of covered picnic areas with grills so you can have birthday parties and such all well lit also along with clean(as clean as you can get for a park) toliet areas lots of rolling hills for exercise or to bring your dogour dog loves coming here it is like disney land for heron the other side is the grat wave pool and a great gym the park offers all sorts of classes and sports leauges for all ageslots of places for kids to playit is just great the only thing i am not crazy about is on the weekends they sometimes also parties and get togethers here that drive me nuts because the music will start early in the morning and go all nightit can really be loud at times even with your doors and windows closedunfortunatly i live close enough to hear it but if you have kids or dogs it is a lot of fun and a great place to explore
1,more i come to this park the more i like itit has every thing you could want for so much fun the other day i was there and they had horses there doing maneuvers they were police horses that was so coolit is a huge place with so much to offerit has a wave pool and a huge man made pond in there you can fish and boat or just sit and enjoy the waterbathrooms arewell park kind i do not use unless i absolutely have to but at least they have themlots of areas for parties and get togethers i do not know if you have to get a permit for that but you can check their websitelots of places to park and you can ride bikes all around in there as well
1,must start this by saying i am spoiled ever since i moved to tempe in 2008 i lived super close to tempe town lake i was in love with running at that park but now i live on the south end of tempe and ttl is really not convenient in the morning rush hour traffic once i discovered that kiwanis was basically my "down the road neighbor" i have been going regularly i love to run in the mornings with my dog before the weather gets too hot for him i think kiwanis may just be his new favorite place because he loves to chase ducks this park while much smaller than ttl has a ton of ducks fish turtles and other types of birds that call the lake their home you see people with nets and fishing poles out there fishing all times of the day there is also a huge playground for kids many pavilions and grills for family get togethers and sometimes they play a movie on a big projection screen in the park if you're an outdoorsy person definitely check out kiwanis park
1,has everything a rec center needs to be considered one of the best right to the point if you ask me i'll cover it all but regardless of age they have all the bases covered lets dive into kiwanis (we can dive into the wave pool later)~what to do~what can't you do if you are a child they offer sports classes up the ying yang like the non-competitive program sportball all the way to fun swimming classes in the huge pool no matter the skill level for adults the tennis courts are outstanding as is the fitness room too finally for the older crowd they have many fun programs available for you to stay active and happy~the good~i really feel that to be a true recreation center you have to be able to provide a large variety of programming for the masses kiwanis in my eyes offers just that and more they offer the largest variety of programming i have found in the valley with me personally being a sports coach i have been to many city rec centers and no center is the same this center is at the top of the food chain they also offer a batting range a batting range do this equation: batting range + wave pool + gym + tennis courts + awesome staff  bonkers good facility just stop by with your child sit down to the left and look through their program guideyou will see the breadth of their course offeringsthen you will see the huge wave pool behind the desk and be sold~the bad~it is an older facility and being so there are some visible areas where they could do some minor renovations however they just re-did the bathrooms and also touched up the walking areas near the softball fields so you can't say they aren't trying my biggest complaint is parking which is situated in bulk on the opposite sides of the center it makes for a relatively long walk no matter which side you park on they have a minor row of parking right up front however if you come anytime really after open on a weekend don't bother trying to find a spot up front in the hot summer months that can be a bit of a nuisance but really that is worst it gets hereparking haha :-)~the down low~this is my favorite center to teach at i prefer it over all others it is the largest has more options than others has spacious grass to frolic on (i said 'frolic' in a review life is complete now) and the staff here are extremely helpful and courteous each time i converse with them like i said earlier just come down and grab a pamphlet with programming info you will be very happy message me if you have questions about programming i am glad to help
1,this park is huge my boyfriend and i were looking for a birthday party today for almost a half an hour no ones fault though we just didn't know where to go we finally met up with our friends and had a great time there was a lot of shaded areas around the park some huge ponds i think i saw people walking with poles so fishing definitely would of been a fun thing to do the kids loved feeding the ducks but we had to watch out for those 4 seater bikes the park rents out those and cute little paddle boats all around a very nice park for any family and friends get together
1,can i not give my community clubhouse 5 starsa couple of pools hot tubs basketball fitness center party room and it's all included in my hoa score
1,reviewed rhodes ranch instead because i noticed that this place didn't have any reviews but here it is again anyways just in casemy friend's family has a vacation home here and we got to go to their recreation center on saturday afternoon it wasn't as crowded even for a 4th of july weekend you can bring up to 4 people into the recreation center for only $5 per person per day not bad the recreation center has a pool and water slides it's like your own mini water park there lots of tables chairs and shade area really big pool i was very impressed they also have indoor basketball courts badminton tennis courts weight room pool hall and workout rooms it was really nice also the area is beautiful very green and well kept for pictures of the water park here it is:http:wwwyelpcombiz_photos-mwzji5foqcuyaa-fv_cagselectuvtmrkqa-zesvtejz-pw2ghttp:wwwyelpcombiz_photos-mwzji5foqcuyaa-fv_cagselectbnzsw9h1bnnie0w7mcamnq
1,of the perks of living here is that we have a great recreation center called the r club the r club has numerous amenities from a resort style pool water slide park lap pool outdoor basketball tennis and beach volleyball inside there is a decent gym with lots of cardio equipment free weights and cross training machines there is also an indoor basketball court and racquetball court for residents all of this is free of charge and as the other review stated for guests its a nominal $5 fee for such a large community i'm actually surprised that more residentsguests don't use the rec center but i guess it's a good thing so it's not crowded all the time
1,- 2 mile walk around the golf course all manicured lawns flowers etc the club house is great and included - best place in vegas area to live
1,owners are free to use the facility  it's very clean compare to lvac  the rec center include full basketball court outdoor swimming pool water slide for the kids pool table cardio section weight train section kitchen for you to rent out lobby is huge for family and friends to hang out even a library  i really think they did a fantastic job  hoa is not even high compare to other place  i am a happy home owner :)
1,love the recreation center at rhodes ranch when you arrive it looks like a hotel the plants the floor the furniture basically the interior is really nice if you do not live in rhodes ranch then you have to be brought in by someone that does they sign you in and you have to pay $5 to get in inside of the recreation center there's a gym dance room basketball court racket ball rooms game room kitchen basically everything i love the gym the most there are a variety of machines weights and balls to choose from there is also air conditioning two tv's and mirrors the game hall is also nice you can play pool and ping pong there is also a water park that's a part of the recreation center i honestly think it's better than wet n wild to be honest very kid friendly and it gets you wet for sure
1, 2 pm alina smith is such a sweety why anyone would give her attitude is beyond me she was so helpful with our registrations  i can't wait to enjoy the recreational center  we're new residents at rr everyone was so welcomingonce we get moved in i'll be able to update this & review the pool fitness center & etc i found out the water park is just for kids waaaa :l i'll get over it
1,awesome awesome you walk in the gate and there is an area to lock up bikes the pool is large and inviting there is a large resort style pool a spa a lap pool and the splash zone (kid area) the kid area is a small wet and wild- these kids nowadays are damn lucky to have this during the summers they have lounge chairs and a couple areas of shade to relax downside : no booze allowed the inside has a nice sitting area with a tv and fireplace they have rooms you can rent for parties and also a bunch of ping pong and pool tables the rest room has lockers (bring your own lock) a steam room room and showers there is an area for dance a huge basketball court racquet ball courts and a small gym i have never had a problems getting machines they only stay open till 9 but it makes me get in there sooner they have vending machines with cold drinks if you get thirsty after your workout it is free for residents new residents must get your photo taken and they will issue you a resident id $5 for guests to use facilities all day the rec center is a huge selling point for this community
1,have been going to the black mountain rec center for a while now and yesterday i went here and it is amazing its huge and has every class imaginable did a drop in spin class having never gone to a spin class ever the instructor was nice enough to help me with my bike and told us do what we couldwell we happened to drop into an intermediate spin classit kicked my assthe customer service here is great the girls that work the front desk are patient and took the time to help us i will defiantly keep going to this rec center it makes the black mt rec center look super ghetto
1,the activity pool here we are new parents and it is so kid friendlyjust be ready for the jerks who are in the parking lotespecially the ones who think that they and their children are just too fragile to walk they will mow down just about anyone  including the handicapped and the elderlyand 15 minute parking should be enforced there's signs up but so many people abuse it
1,my husband and i were looking for a place with an indoor pool and i found this place on yelp we checked it out and it was huge they had an indoor track indoor basketball court indoor and outdoor pool rock climbing and they also do activity a for the kids (all different ages) and adults there zumba cooking classes karate swimming classes and even classes for the little kids i think 11months and up (i was happy about that bc my daughter is 14 months) anything you could possibly think of they do it there yes this place is pretty popular soo expect it to be packed with people :p
1,clean for the most part i use the indoor pool on a daily basis and i do find some bugs on occasion im sure it is because they leave the doors open which i don't quite understand but whatever locker rooms are kept very nice and usually smell clean at 5am i hate germs and am very paranoid but they take care of the facility staff is pretty friendly & helpful lifeguards seem to be high school students which kinda worries me if someone were to have an accident but i suppose they have had proper trainingoverall its a good place
1,swim classes events and dance class we have a 4 and 2 year old so we are here almost every week
1,place is great  i've had my daughters take tumbling classes my son do the seasonal sports and all five of my kids have used the swimming facilities  it's affordable safe and diverse enough that we all look forward to trying the different classes  my spouse loves cooking and is excited about the different types of food courses offered  my daughters are interested in learning guitar and piano  my sons may take karate or any number of age appropriate classes  there is a limited day care that i haven't used yet but am excited about the potential  the gym is small but has what you need for a pretty good work out  the indoor track is really nice especially in the summer timei just can't say enough good things about them  i really am glad that it's here
1,was actually the highlight of my last vegas trip i know not the gold not the girls or the alcohol but the one day to really unwind here and get to use the facilities here i loved the pool tables basketball courts were amazing it was cool on a 97 degree day my friends and i loved it coming here  i had not really been hitting the gym lately so i had the best time ever grabbing one handed rebounds with my old and new friends showing them i still have some basketball game left my jumpshot was still really nice  i hit a lot of three pointers and my team won more than 80% of the games we played here  it was really relaxing i mean we could have been stuffing our face again in a buffet that day but this really workedit is the best place to visit leave the strip next time you are in vegas and drive over here i wish the exact same facility was in ny i would go all the time-swimming pools here looked amazing but didn't get to go
1,place with a variety of activities to do
1,place is awesome it has a indoor outdoor pool area exercise room indoor basketball court rock climbing wall dance classroom kitchen room pilateyoga room dance room exercise room indoor track playroom for children minutes away from public library shopping center 4-5 star hotel resort and office buildings and parks and trails  there are many outdoor and indoor activities for all ages  definitely a must see for new residence and visitors

1,am amazed at the quality and luxury of this place my 82 yr old mother moved in about 3 months ago and is the happiest i've seen her in years enjoying  the great living spaces wonderful staff and fabulous food she has made new friends and tells me about all the activities she is participating in  i wish i were old enough to get a plac e here
1,mother has lived at westminster for over 5 years  it has been the very best experience possible  the staff have been tremendously helpful and caring  when the time came to transition from independent to assisted living they demonstratedgreat caring and patience in helping her through that lifestyle change  every department from marketing home health nursing housekeeping and more have continued to offer every assistance  our entire family would not hesitate to highly recommend this wonderful caring community
1,parentsboth of which are 92moved to wmv two years ago they could not be more pleased
1,care center gave me back my life  i have been here over a year and plan on going home soon i have received great care from my doctors nurses and the staff here the physical therapy folks are the best  god bless you and thanks tlc 
1,mother has been at four different rehab centers in las vegas over the past 1 12 yearsand for the last several months we have been at tlc we could not be happier with the service staff and environment there is always a doctor on staff which is very hard to find in a rehabthe nurses are very knowledgeable courteous and attentiveand have been dedicated to giving my mother consistent attention i would highly recommend this facility to anyone who deeply cares about where their loved one is placed we can't be grateful and thankful enough
1,am a physical therapist and prior to my current position  i used to work in home health during my stint with home health i had many patients at this facility the facility is very clean and beautifully decorated with lots of open space they have an extensive activity program and have nice exercise and game rooms even with all of this the th that i was most impressed with was the care and professionalism of the staff the staff here was truly caring and attentive as a health care professional i notice many things on facilities like this that others might miss and i must say that prestige is a fantastic place if you are considering assisted living for yourself or a family member
1,102 year old mother in law was here at prestige for a couple of months and our experience was excellent mostly because of the very compassionate caring and understanding personal they treated her and us wonderfully
1,gardens of scottsdale is a very well-kept place on the inside and on the outside i included photos of the grounds near the northwest portion of the complex at 60th st and thomas rd as of today the map shown at yelp for brighton gardens is not accurately showing the location of 6001 e thomas rd the three staff members that i had contact with were very friendly and helpful this hospice of the valley location is located on the valley metro (602-253-5000) bus line 29 (thomas rd) there is a fry's food store across the street on the north side of thomas rd the room i visited was very comfortable and cleanhttp:wwwsunriseseniorlivingcomcommunitiesbrighton-gardens-of-scottsdaleoverviewaspx
1,to face the unfortunate fact that we may have to move our mother to a care facility i checked out brighton gardens on thomas and 60th street  i showed up a half hour prior to my planned meeting and was able to sit and observe the staff and what was going on  working in the medical field for over 25 years i know the signs to look for  i was very pleased my the joy i saw on the employees faces  i knew it was a happy place to be for everyone  after meeting with ginny the coordinator i felt really good  i don't feel like it was a "nursing home"  the place was very nice  i felt like i was in a hotel  having helped at a nursing home as a teenager i could never forget the smell of a nursing home i can tell you this is not a nursing home  it was wonderful clean active and happy  i would recommend it for anyone looking for a great place for a loved one
1,father died quite a few years ago of als it is a cruel painful way to die fortunately he spent his last few months getting hospice care while living at brighton gardens the staff there were unbelievably kind and thoughtful i didn't realize this until much later when i started looking for a place for my mother and realized how pitifully few places match this kind of quality end-of-life is cruel it can strip every last bit of dignity away from a person but brighton gardens staff understood this and did everything they could to help him and us if we lived in arizona now i would definitely consider this place for my dear mom
1,a lengthy stay in the icu my mom was brought here and spent three weeks  we visited  a couple nursing homes but the one we selected couldn't take her  she was brought here but we were a little anxious after seeing it only had 25 stars    this place far exceeded our expectations  its the only nursing home we went to that didn't smell like pee and poop  the rooms are comparable to a nice hotel very clean  she enjoyed the food  and most of the residents seemed to be in good spirits which to us says a lot  the nursing staff was fantastic  she especially enjoyed her time with ian her speech therapist  physical therapy team did wonders  she spent a month in the icu sedated for 2 weeks on a feeding tube and suffered icu phycosis before she was brought to freedom plaza care center  they had her up and walking and taking care of herself in a few short daysthank you freedom plaza care center staff for giving us back our mom
1,anyone is looking for a place for their parent or friend you need go no further  we were struggling with my father going through the stages of dementia and general failings of age medication etc and we were referred to this fabulous care home sunrise home facility managed and owned by lida cubillos  he is now there and doing so well we are able to breathe a sigh of relief and all the anxiety about him is now gone for us  lida treats everyone like family but with respect and privacy  she makes it all clean and comfortable for the 10 residents she and her staff care for  she was a registered nurse and is a great patient advocate she understands meds and the aging process -  coordinating well with doctors while at the same time  also spending time with the residents herself making them all feel special  if you have any questions or want to hear more please email me at lsscottmaccom as i know how hard it is when trying to find good care
1,the moment you meet lida you know that your loved one will be taken care of she's a dedicated and caring person who respects and understands people - and is involved with making sure operations work to her standards highly recommended
1,amazing home services i have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees residents and the owner lida beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family i wish there was 10 stars to rate them :)
1,am not a resident here(still have a few years to go) but this place is awesome i was lucky enough to visit and have lunch with some of the residents the facility is absolutely beautiful and the staff are some of the friendliest people i have ever met all of the residents i met told me how much they loved living there and everyone seemed so happy they allow redident to have pets (under 30 lbs) wich i thought was really cool they even have happy hour in the on-site barthe food was great and the activities they offer residents are amazing the day i was there they were setting up for oktoberfest and beer tasting niceif you have a loved one that needs a friendly safe and fun place to live i would recommend you check this place out
1,husband and i just returned from dinner at mcdowell village with my mother this evening having had a lovely experience of good food excellent service and engaging residents who stopped by our table to say hello  we've seen mcdowell village up close and personal for the last 8 months attending special events and dropping in regularly  my mother has enjoyed concerts outings to restaurants that we would love to experience fun card playing participation in an art show warm interaction with staff new friends among residents and a happy environment that feels like a mini-resort  the staff has a great esprit de corps with fun warm and caring attitudes; the residents have universally spoken about how happy they are there  i would not hesitate to recommend mcdowell village
1,cannot say enough wonderful things about mcdowell village including debbie kristen and jay  my parents after searching the area for the right senior residence decided on mcdowell village and they couldn't be happier  there are activities all day long and special events for many of the holidays  the restaurant's ambience is really nice and the food is delicious  there are summer concerts happy hour outings and shuttles to doctor appointments local grocery stores banks etc weekly  the staff is outwardly caring and attentive to the resident's needs  i live out-of-state and several months ago my mother had a health incident early one morning while i was talking with her on the phone  i called mcdowell village immediately and they sent an ambulance and a staff member went up to their apartment and stayed with them until help arrived the staff's quick response time and ability to handle a potentially life-threatening situation allowed me time to get on a plane and get to my parents without nearly as much stress as i would have felt otherwise  i could go on and on but suffice to say if you are looking for a senior residence i highly recommend mcdowell village without hesitation
1,is a great retirement community i cannot review it much because i do not live here; however my grandmother is very happy here and well taken care ofthey have a daily list of events in which residents can partake in including things that are not on site meals each day as well differ and that gives residents chances to change things up i've ate here several times and the food is very good especially with the plethora of different things cooked up on holidaysresidents are allowed small animals on premises as well which helps with companionship there is a gym and activity center so that residents may also get exercise lastly my grandmother's favorite----a beauty salon
1,treat my mom great
1,company i've gotten to know this team pretty well and totally recommend
1,at agritopia has an a+ team  they are super friendly and knowledgeable  i would highly recommend them if you are looking for senior retirement communities for your loved one

1,is a state of the art retirement center the team is great and top quality i highly recommend them for your family members check them out as soon as you can
1,used all the best catering for a business luncheon and had a great experience  cheryl was very friendly and patient with my various questions and accomodated all of my requests  i'm definitely bookmarking all the best catering for all my catering needs in pittsburgh
1,was recently married at a venue that listed them as one of their four caterers to choose from my partner and i did a tasting of their food thinking we'd try to meet with at least two to three of the vendors but after tasting the food (and getting zero response from the other caterer we'd outreached to) we decided to go with all the best and we were both so glad we did they were the most reasonably priced of all the listed caterers and i have to say  going with all the best we really felt we got a lot of bang for our buckthe food was delicious and plentiful and the service was truly great - they thought of things my partner and i never would have all of our guests raved about the food even though we got the stereotypical "wedding food" it was good wedding food i highly recommend them for catered events - plus as a bonus they own pittsburgh bbq company so we were able to get mini pulled pork sliders as an appetizer which everyone loved
1,experience we had a string quartet for our wedding (steve ehrlich strings) and they did a very nice job were subtle but present and definitely knew what they were doing contact and communication before the wedding was very good too definitely recommended - and our guests really liked the live music
1,hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful there were a few customer service issues i had that i'd like to mention so that others are aware 1- i booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website i have a military id and requested the military discount i was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told i only needed to present my id upon arrival unfortunately when i arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that i could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate that i could only have two of them i pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that i was quoted bad way to start a fun occasion2- i emailed back and forth with tracy bernstein about specifics that i needed for this gathering i was hosting (ipod player microwave fridge early check-in) i was told these things would be ready and they were not we never got the ipod player microwave or fridge bad customer service tracynow i'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at holiday inn city center 1- very clean and modern i loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography2- the rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle3- jay jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful he arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price i've been told he has the "hookup" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special 4- adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me he offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for free are you serious free he even came by the room to make sure we got all that i requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm we very happily toned it down by that point the stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great i really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special
1,stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  if you check my previous reviews i always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when i travel (ihg brand)  while 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake  based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)at least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay  after parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (i wish i remembered her name)  she told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel and i truly believe it our room was 15th floor room 1534  it was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel) and the ceilings were over 12 feet high our king bed was comfy as always and i always fall asleep quickly on themthe hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people  it is located one block from the epicenter and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting    the one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 35 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw wicked and it was fantastic)  other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown  in the beginning of my post i said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the holiday inn brand hotels  for anybody looking into hotels i suggest you sign up for their rewards system whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it  hotels reward loyalty and will do a lot to keep you loyal  we did our research and liked the ihg brand (everything from holiday inn express to intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points and price-wise they stay competitive  our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create)  so as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs then stick to it  if you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year they will do a little more to keep you happy and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way when i first started out with my priority club membership i highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost)  the room was only $97 and that really can't be beat  for this location
1,wife booked my son and i for a fatherson weekend to the giantspanthers game i had no idea a holiday inn could be so nice it offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling the decor room location were all 5 stars the front desk and valet parking were top notch i needed to charge my phone and ipad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it after we were done he parked it again with a smilewe will absolutely be back thank you for a wonderful stay
1,location with a warm friendly staff  what more could you ask for  everyone from the valets to front desk staff were wonderful  our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years  when we mentioned we were in charlotte for a sick relative kids in tow and that it was our anniversary they delivered chocolate covered fruit to our room  if you book through their website the prices are very reasonable
1,had a birthday party here about 5 years ago and i brought about 9 of my closest friends and we dressed up in ballgowns with fancy jewelry and took pictures then i got this super delicious vanilla cake with pink flowers on it of all of my birthday parties this one wins hands-down i know little about their food-but their cakes are pretty amazing adorable little place to have a party or sit down and drink some teakind of like a fairytale cafela-tea-da's is the coolest party place for girls in town
1,me: female new yorker foodie design-loverla-tea-da's did the reception catering for my wedding kelly matthews was my catering lead and jessica also helped on the day of the eventmy expectations were dramatically exceeded i would recommend them to anyone for these reasons:1 flexibility - as an out-of-town bride kelly was quick in responses edits to estimates and suggestions to queries via email since i couldn't attend in-person meetings too often2 professionalism - team worked so i didn't have to think about anything on the day of the wedding they even prepared plates and drinks for my husband and i so that we didn't wait in the buffet line and had a few minutes at our table to eat before crowds arrived jessica helped by directing us during the event as well and giving us heads up on timings in addition to food they helped set up decor - even lit lanterns and candles on tables3 fair prices - i wanted interesting food combinations which doesn't usually go hand-in-hand with reasonable pricing for a big event however kelly was great in offering many choices and speaking to the chef several times to ensure we had great variety4 presentation - food was displayed beautifully kelly gave helpful suggestions on how to set up the buffet for good crowd flow throughout the event my favorite presentation was a small bamboo plate with a bbq slider and homemade potato chips - delish5 quality - i received a lot of questions about who did my catering from friends who are also in the wedding planning mode guests loved the food and flavors were appealing to allagain can't recommend them enough - definitely add them to your list when interviewing caterers
1,tea da's catered both my rehearsal dinner and wedding this past april and i don't even have words to express how amazing the whole experience was being a foodie and someone who works in the industry i have pretty high standards i certainly didn't make it easy on them we brought la-tea-da's on as our caterer at the last minute seriously last minute - like a week before did i mention my wedding was multicultural and i wanted to include a good amount of venezuelan and spanish inspired dishes janet met with me to discuss the menus only days before the wedding and she put my mind at ease instantly all of the challenges i thought would be insurmountable namely my eclectic taste in food only seemed to excite her more as she threw out creative solutions and suggestions with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store in the end i wound up with my dream menu incredible passed hors d'oeuvres paella tapas shrimp & grits ceviche gazpacho tacos sushi a venezuelan parilla station late night philly cheese steak sliders and more somehow all came together beautifully to create one of the best food experiences i've ever had my guests consistently echo my sentiments as well my only regret was not taking the time to eat even more (though it wasn't for lack of trying on the part of the staff we arrived to the reception venue to a lovely candlelit sampling for two while the cocktail hour wrapped up and the amazing staff diligently kept our cups and plates full the whole night) i could go on and on but let's just say i'm anxiously awaiting a ten year vow renewal of some sort so i can call la-tea-da's up and do it all again
1,will never be able to say enough about elizabeth and the staff at la tea da's they are beyond amazing they catered our wedding reception and i have never heard so many compliments about food from guests at a wedding they also created a signature drink that was a huge hit and went above and beyond to make sure me my husband and our guests were enjoying ourselves elizabeth is a dream come true she helped me from the initial stages of wedding planning and served as my day of coordinator she is truly outstanding at her job we love them and will be recommending them to all of our friends
1,food was absolutely delicious but the service was even better hats off to debbie service with a smile and great conversation
1,used waiter's choice for dozens of catering jobs mostly corporate lunches at work for 10 to 120 people i have used their white tablecloth formal setup as well as their express style service most recently they catered breakfast  2 days last week and lunch 3 days last week each for 20 people each delivery was perfectly on time and exactly what i ordered they are always professional and the food is great in the last week alone i have eaten their fried chicken beef brisket pulled pork sausage egg and cheese croissant sandwiches cookies brownies and a variety of sides keep up the good work we need more place like waiter's choice that understand how to manage good food and fantastic customer service at reasonable prices
1,catered our thanksgiving office party and did a nice ob we ordered a traditional turkey and trimmings meal everything tasted delicious the turkey was not dry as it sometimes can be and i was a big fan of their mashed-potatoes and tea (i mix sweet & unsweet together) high marks for a great job
1,c how can you review a place that you've never been to i'm sure the great barrier reef is worth a 5 star review but i can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter) anywaysaw crandalls in madison magazine and the photos stood out to me i didn't want to drive to the east side for the esquire club i was reluctant to try take out fish fry because i was worried about fried food getting soggy i gave it a shot and i was impressed first the fish to beading ratio was really good big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense probably corn meal based and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter) it was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish served with a lemon the fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning the slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy which was good contrast with the fish the server gladly gave me extra the bun was just as you would expect from a supper club cheap white and doughy served with a butter chip everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beersthe service was fine the take out window was nice it takes a few minutes for the order but i think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus any you cut it it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in friday fish frya little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners that would be more than fair if i could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat it's worth it though and i'll be back
1,fish fry is awesome  loved it long time  the red potatoes with cheese are delishit's carry out but that is finetake it out pop in a movie and have a brandy old fashionthe latinos working their are hot too
1,has moved to state street and is now serving authentic peruvian food we went there for dinner tonight and it was fabulous i highly recommend the cheese empanadas solterito (fava bean and corn salad) and the chaufa de quinoa (like fried rice but with quinoa) they make chicha morada which is a drink made from purple corn and is super refreshingcrandalls is owned by a very sweet family from peru and i'm so happy to see that they are now showcasing their roots with their new restaurantthey do still have their famous fish fry and it looked like the lunch menu has cheese curds and sandwiches as well as ceviche
1,our wedding here and it was fantastic absolutely loved working with stacey - she answered all our questions and got back to us in a timely manner they were totally flexible and the serversbartenders were phenomenal we have had nothing but compliments about our wedding i would recommend windsor in a heartbeatbecause we booked our wedding reception on friday night we were told we would be receiving a "complimentary" champagne toast after the wedding though we received a bill charging us for the service fee and gratuity for pouring the champagne we paid it without any grievances but it would have been nice if they would have informed us of this when we were going over the preliminary invoice other than this minor issue windsor was wonderful
1,have no complaints  my brother and i were throwing a 50th anniversary party for our parents and i was looking for some decorations  the woman who first helped me explained the pros and cons about paper vs plastic plates  then another woman came to help and she said why don't i rent the plates  they are totally cheap and i got the white with gold rim china plates  i picked them up the day before the event and they loaded them in my trunk  when i dropped them off they took them out too  they come in a closed plastic banquet plate container and you don't have to wash them  to me i was being green as well as making it a very nice looking table
1,place around for anything rental or for party decorations their inventory is very large and everything is in great shape and condition staff is helpful and friendly we like to support local businesses
1,thanks to liz and the team at party people for their help through this process  i live in san diego and have been planning a party here in phoenix  i picked up the rental items today and am so happy with the superior customer service and products  this shop is by far the best party rental shop i have ever dealt with and would recommend them to anyone in the area  and oh boy the store is full of wonderful party supplies  even fun just to walk through for party ideas
1,love seeing local businesses succeed in this market the store was extremely organized and the show room gave me amazing ideas on how to decorate my party their inventory is staggering from linens to silverware dance floors electronic equipment dishes center pieces chairs even canopies not to mention every kind of paper good you could ever imagine  *like the person below me i have driven by it for years happy i finally went in it was easy to load up and drop off and the staff was very helpful i will definitely go back in to use party people again
1,is a great place i pop in here all the time they always have what i need and the prices are usually lower than elsewherei rented tables chairs dishes silverware and goblets for my son's outside wedding everything looked wonderful the lady who helped me gave some wonderful suggestions  we had no problems with delivery and there was no problem with the orderi highly recommend using them for all your event needs
1,live in california and was looking for a local florist in phoenix to send a friend an arrangement i looked on yelp and found the garden of england flower shop and decided to give them a call i want to thank all the people that recommended this florist when i called the owner answered and was very friendly she made some suggestions for the arrangement and scheduled the delivery for the same day i didn't see the arrangement but i did get a call from my friend a few hours later thanking me for the "gorgeous floral arrangement" i will definitely use garden of england again if i ever need so send flowers in the phoenix area again and i highly recommend this florist
1,been to the glass center perhaps 5 or so times now i've gone for a toursdemonstrations and two "make it now" classes i have thoroughly enjoyed going each and every time some of the art they have on display is fantastic it was interesting the last time i went because local artists were there to sell glass work they madethe make it now classes are well worth $25 you get to be somewhat involved in creating the object (you get to pick the color blow the glass and do a couple of other things you never get too hot to the ovens or do anything dangerous at all if you want to be more involved there are other more advanced classes that you can take) plus you have a wonderful piece of art to take home i've made an ornament and pumpkin so far and will be making a flower soon the instructors have all been very nice and helpful as well making the experience even betteri can't wait to go back
1,love the glass center i've been lucky enough to attend quite a few events here and also do a small class where i was able to make an ornament the staff is always friendly and fun and i always leave feeling grateful that we have such a unique place here in pittsburgh
1,glass center is a marvelous addition the pittsburgh cultural scene  they are a gallery a place to take classes a center for glass artists in residence and much more  whether you are taking a tour a class or visiting the gift shop or gallery there's a lot to see and learn here  i've taken tours several times with different groups but i always learn something new and i am always impressed by the great work takes place at the centerthey will take students at every level  their facility is well run and professionally staffed  i was delighted to meet their enthusiastic staffthere's a hot shop a cold shop a flame shop and a gallery so there's lots to see and learn
1,went to a yelp event here where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery everything in the gallery was amazing the demonstrations were neat and the fused glass was something i would go back to do againi really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time and if you go there on any random day you can watch whatever is going on i think that is pretty cool they also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want i can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class
1,here with my girlfriends last saturday  they were having a girls night event  a small bar & desserts were included in the price  it was $40 per person we loved it  we worked closely with a glass artist  we didn't just watch we were acutally doing it  we made glass flowers i can't wait to pick mine up  (it takes a few days)  i definitely recommend this as something different to do with friends or on a date my one friend did a glass blowing event there & said that this was much more hands on than the glass blowing was
1,jcc has a great gym i highly recommend going to lyn's zumba classes which are free to all members she has a strong dance background and she's very energetic and easy to follow
1,wonderful place to workout and swim - a true vibrant center of culture and jewish life in charlotte
1,family and i love everything the jcc has to offer i use the gym pool and basketball courts quite often and they are always clean and very well maintained
1,isn't  a review of the museum itself but of the special exhibit they were hosting - jim henson's fantastic world  i couldn't find somewhere to post a review of jus the exhibitthe exhibit is traveling around the country for the next few years - and if you are a henson fan you should definitely try to see it  here is a list of where it will be http:wwwsitessieduexhibitionsexhibitshensonmainhtmthe exhibit includes original posters drawings and notebooks video clips as well as muppets  kids will enjoy seeing the muppets adults will enjoy the whole exhibit  at the end was a place for kids to put on a puppet show make a storyboard and make a face for a muppetit was very interesting to get an insight into the genius henson was and how if he didn't use an idea in one place he would try to get it incorporated into something elseits at this museum until march 9th
1,museum is fantastic we recently visited it on vacation i have a 8 year old and an almost 5-year old they have a pretend area for younger kids  it is a bit young for my kids but of course they still loved it the exhibits in the museum were well thought out with opportunities for children to experiment in all different mediums for example one of the two exhibits was called table manners we could read books about table manners experiment with chopsticks and play food make table scapes and then draw them and much more and then of course there was the art they had a nice selection again in different mediums museum was clean staff was friendly and overall we will visit again if in town
1,was told about this place a long time ago and finally went with my son this week  it was awesome  we spent our time in artville where it's totally kidproof and touchable  it costs an admission fee for kids over 1 so it made sense for us to buy a membership if we planned on coming a few more times  we'll definitely go backupdate 2011:we still have a membership here it's not too busy on the weekdays which i have off in the summertime  on saturdays it can get kinda crazy - go early if you can  bring a sweater if you tend to get cold because the ac is cranked  watch out for the people who don't pay attention and let their kids go bonkers in artville  that area is meant for ages 0-4 and occasionally you'll get some bigger kids in there andor one of those jerkface kids that is a little brat while their parent is in a corner texting obliviously  you know what i'm talkin' about  if you're a member they have early admission days usually on a thursdaywhich would be nice if i wasn't working :(  i wish they would do that on a saturday
1,place was fantastic  he held our organization's holiday party and silent auction here  what a great place for kids  my twins had a blast and the space lend itself so perfectly for our party  the staff was very helpful and accommodating  we moved furniture around since we had to use several tables from other rooms for our silent auction items  the event was fantastic unfortunately i was so busy running around making sure everything went well with the silent auction that i didn't get to enjoy the space with my twins  good thing i had a sitter help my hubby  i guess i'll have to come back soon
1,son absolutely adores this place there is plenty to do they have made some good changes to their layout and also their exhibits and play areas if you haven't been here in a while a lot of hands on activities for the children and the adults can participate too definitely a nice place to let your children explore their creative side in the east valley
1,came here for a birthday party  it was so much fun  we were greeted by the front desk  they informed us that our host were not there yet but we were welcome to roam around the place  they had arts and crafts everywhere  interesting facts and information on the walls  when our host arrived we follow our guide to a back area (filled with trees and tableschairs for outdoor activities) and then to a building in the back for our party  we had the whole back building to ourselves  it was nice  tables chairs and art canvasesart supplies all set up  signs wishing our birthday girl (with her name on it)  the room has it's own bathrooms so you do not need to run back to the main building  we had 1-12 hours in the back room  then we were free to enjoy the museum  there are two separate areas artscraft & playlearn room  i had fun along with the kids
1,music store should be the example for all music stores the staff are knowledgable friendly and professional i've had a few guitars set up to perfection that were supposedly set up previously highly recommend
1,quaint little music shop is a secret find of mine  great prices fantastic staff and knowledgeable staff (important in this business)  i love coming to this music store because they always seem to have what is needed and having three musicians in our house that is important  we recently took an instrument to be looked at for repair and the guy fixed it on the spot no charge of course we ended up spending money in the store anyways so it was a win-win for buchanan music and myself  i've me the owner a few times and he's always willing to work with me on prices and helped order me a personalized product once highly recommended
1,music is an authorized takamine dealer and russ is the guy that we've dealt with in the past year  he is completely awesomesometimes calling whomever picks up the phone if it's a woman it's a bit hard to understand her but as long as we get russ there's no issues  he was our go to when we needed to get our takamine replaced russ helped us so much in sending our guitar to kmc music but also receiving it which is another story in itself  he made sure we got a good guitar this time  and about 6 months later the guitar needed some adjustments and russ did it  the guitar plays beautifully and we appreciate russ' talent in working on guitars  you can tell he loves the instrument and is a master craftsmanwe appreciate your work russ  thank you for helping my husband develop his passion and love for the guitar
1,attended a class at scottsdale art school and was fabulously happy with not only the class but the staff as well the school has a warm friendly atmosphere that makes you want to come back  it was a great experience and i absolutely would like to return for more classes
1,artist's school is a great place for a workshop it was an elementary school at one time and still has an interesting traditional quality with beautiful tile floors generously sized classrooms a lovely patio and a professional staffthe school brings notable artists from all over and students also come from everywherethe friends of the school organization gave a reception on thursday with bountiful food & wine that night there was a gallery walk in old towni enjoyed my week there scottsdale itself doesn't have great appeal though there wasn't time to explore much and that is just as well
1,this internationally known art school  whether you are a art workshop junkie or enjoy the open studios this is an amazing place to learn or improve your skill  the staff is super helpful  due to my work schedule i have only taken one workshop from one of the famous instructors (although i regularly droll through the online offerings) but drive down to scottsdale for the evening or saturday open studios  pay $10 for hours of a variety of models in short & long poses  the school has decades of great reputation for a reason
1,tempe center for the arts  700 w rio salado parkway is where i went to see childsplay last weekend what a beautiful venueferdinand the bull was showing & it was fabulous kudos to the entire cast folks this place is really a treasure i know you've heard people say that nonchalantly about stupid stuff but this is for reallike all of our other theatres in town this place deserves our patronage and support if you don't have kids go alone or take your niece or nephew you won't be disappointed
1,no business like show business as any of my friends will tell you i am a theater junkie i could sit in a theater all day all week all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent lol well in actuality hmmmmmmm i really could i am not even joking on that i probably would if someone brought me water every now and again lol  ok seriously now childsplay is my favorite organization in az for a host of reasons    my dear friends of childsplay know who they are this is children's theater at it's best the q and a sessions after each show is a plus the kids love it i have to admit i do too since i get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show i also learn more techniques that i can steal when i teach drama to my inner city students teehee  ( yes i am a teacher and yes i would die to have some of their costumes and sets)    i have seen so many wonderful plays literature remakes and original scripts performed at tcpa and by childsplay fernidad bfg and new kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces i have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors debbie scott katie jodi; well all of them love you   childsplay also has an artist in residence program for schools we have had an artist at our school for several years it is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future time after time i have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage     of importance to note tcpa is a beautiful facility you can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent what more can you ask for     the only negative i can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families but if you like them on facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets a great way to start viewing them and get involved    i do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in az as i have stated in my other "arts" reviews i do worry about cultural program survival in az with recent state budget cuts soooooooo as a famous circusrodeo person once said "go on with the show"
1,went to see a show at the tempe center for the arts with my son few weeks ago rock the presidents was showing and it was highly entertaining the venue was incredibly beautiful the music was fantastic the cast was incredible and the presentation was just phenomenal we loved it my son learned so much about the leaders of our country in a 70 minute show there were students screaming and dancing fist-pumping having a blast rocking with the presidents thank you for providing such great entertainment deserves 5 stars
1,have never been to a show i didn't like  childsplay is the creme de la creme of children's theatre  the actors are phenomenal and the bees knees at their craft  their costumes and sets hypnotize me and reel me in from the get go  i love their q&a sessions at the end of each play and the fact that they have a set of questions you can take home with you for the car ride back  they use literature for the majority of their plays and have new shows every single year  but what is even better is their traveling shows they send to schools around the valley and country  if you are lucky enough to get a grant for them to come you get shows that are just as good as those in the tempe performing arts center  their sets are smaller but they have their amazing costumes props and music along with them  they still do q&a sessions after these traveling shows and give us teachers those same questions that they do at the tpac shows  it doesn't matter if you are an adult without kidseveryone should attend at least one childsplay show in their lifetime  you are missing out if you don't
1,programming for children's theater they also run acting classes for children on weekends and during summer camps my child has participated numerous times and we've seen incredible progress in his talent and skills
1,really cannot write enough good things about this studio and its teachers my son has been playing violin since he was 3 he is now 8 and starting his second year with the las vegas youth orchestra he has learned an extraordinary amount from ms berns and other teachers there who have really guided his ability he has fun and really loves to read and play and compose music my daughter has been  taking piano lesson for a year now and i appreciate the humor and patience of her teacher he has gone the extra mile to find material to really teach her all about piano
1,drink specials during happy hour fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious wing night on tuesday and thursday
1,up near here the family would always go once a month haven't stopped in for a few years until last friday with a few friends to grab a drink the sandwiches are always amazing just as i remember the staff is amazing and friendly great place for lunch as well
1,there be no question: alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades try a burger on italian bread the service is flawlessly friendly the food is amazing and the wings oh the wings but it's still about the cheeseburger the atmosphere is inviting but you can't eat atmosphere so go right now grab the car keys you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger maybe some wings and a cold beer easily hands down the best bar and grill in pittsburgh
1,sandwiches the wings enough said alexions can best be described as a home-style primantis before they went mega commercial you really can't go wrong but for my money i would put alexions fish sandwich up with the best i've had that's not to take away from other selections but if you come here i recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich reuben or wings you'll know you're in a pittsburgh bar when you walk in for someone who lives in atlanta now and only makes it to pittsburgh a few times a year i have to say it is refreshing feels like home i haven't had a trip back without making it out to alexions at least once
1,not the closest kings to us but we often will travel the extra miles because the service and food at this location is always the best
1,was great
1,you are searching for a go to fish place for lentlook no further  this place will give you the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh  the sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches  you will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seatingenjoy
1,dinners american endless soup and salad bar is great most food for your dollar i highly recommend great bar good place to watch a game the bar can get quite noisy in the evenings but it adds to the great atmosphere at rocky's
1,love their stakes and i come here every week just to get the t bone steak it is completely delicious great atmosphere there is always a lot people and the waiters are nice; food portion is great as well
1,time with hubby after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal waitress was such an adorable girl her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great jobstrawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) strawberry milkshake nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop orderingits always nice when u go late at night like us it is not crowded not noisy nice music playing and always nice people around if you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say denny's
1,location never disappoints food is always consistently great and if you come at the right time (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back and it is awesome  love this place
1,place for a birthday party  a family gathering  a work retirement party  or even a double-datea combination watering hole great place to eat and great entertainment for adults adult gamesthe homestead (pittsburgh) location of dave & busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from new york to florida to california - - from canada to mexico  the dave & busters idea was conceived in little rock arkansas back in the 1970s two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other the two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense so they opened the first combined d & b in      no not little rock but dallas to this day there are no d & b's in little rock not sure what is up with that but lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businessesthe one in pittsburgh is the only one i have ever been to  when i lived there a group of friends and co-workers (and me of course)used to go there for happy hour & power hour     at least once a week we had a blast  a great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt awaywonder if they'll ever open one in marin county ca shucks  probably not not a marin county scene for sure what a blast it was though i miss going to d & b they have all the classics like billiards & shuffleboard plus over 200 interactive & video games a rechargable power card provides an easy way to access all the games  power hour is game happy hour - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks  a great bar wonderful food and service a relaxing and fun way to spend a friday or saturday evening you'll never want to leave meet your friends here grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games time will just evaporate     while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl your best friend or even your boss  dave & busters lots of parking lots of funfun fun fun fun fun fun     bring on the beer
1,and busters is the best place to eat and play games there is many fun games and prizes to win i highly suggest if you want to plays games go wednesday when all the games are half off food is pretty good and a nice bar the downside is that the booze is pretty pricey
1,love it  love it
1,& busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attendthe main squeeze and i always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) attend on a wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules) we'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food and we only drink cheap drafts or drink cocktails during happy houryour visit is largely determined by time of day expectations and whether or not you eat their food if you come on a friday night the lines will be long you'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouththe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee note the "drinks are weak" reviews also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person that's typical white trash behavior bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests all of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well i have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed loud guests and address me and take my order first this is rational logical behavior also note the "prize center games suck" comments you're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize like life delaying gratification nets you bigger returns every other visit i've seen someone walk out with a video game system (wii xbox360 and even a few xbox one's) the thing about dave & busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day sunday afternoon it's all families and friday and saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings the atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the placethis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3monthly visits most visits are 5 stars some are 4 starsusing survey receipts for buy ten get ten avoiding wednesday friday or saturday evenings (and sunday afternoon families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply you'll have a great experience for $25-40personi really enjoy the staff too they split the difference between fun and professional special shout out to riley gave us info on possibly hosting a party there
1,is good food but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks & watch sports on the big screens it's great for adult fun after 10pm great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxed
1,having a few 'less than memorable' trips to d&b in years past my wife and i  decided to go back for a pittsburgh happy hour anniversary party this past thursday  pgh happy hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 247 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job  anyway- pgh hh was celebrating an anniversary and chose d&b for the location  the d&b staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low  our server carla was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point  the other server back there was working equally as hard but i never got the chance to get her name  i had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but i never got the chance to give them any credit  i think d&b is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event
1,off let me say that i find the people who usually work at dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job a friend and i went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time the manager tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok every staff member we talked to was extremely nice this is by far the best dave and busters i've had been to
1,am a big fan of rock bottomthere are several dishes that are moneyappetizer:  seared ahi spinach artichoke dipentree :      fire steak pub tips or chicken fried chickendesert :      carrot cake (to die for)bar food:     pizza or ball park pretzels  both of which are sprayed with brown ale  half the menu is really good the other half is great  the beer is good  ask for the sampler  they usually have a velvet and something on cask  ask for one of those if you are looking for something different  they will also have a scotch ale an ipa whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which if its still matt the mood is grumpy)   if andy is still working there he is sure to please and molly is great in the cocktail areahead over to sing sing after dinner and its a wrapi used to work there several years ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly candon't go to the one in charlotte though its not really a rock bottom
1,love this place  great atmosphere and friendly service every time i go
1,would have to say i'm pretty partial to rock bottom i have been going almost every thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic "team trivia" my friends and i love the atmosphere the dj (todd) and the service that we get at rock bottom every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new as an avid rock bottomer hands down i have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have had here at rock bottom whether i have eaten dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant my favorite and my food of choice is the enormous ball park pretzels with the cheese dip it is a meal itself the mixture of onions cheese spinach and tomatoes is perfection another favorite of mine is the barbecue chicken pizza it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people the service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff a truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people come to team trivia every thursday at 8pm
1,tacos were excellent great brewed beers on tap as well
1,egg rolls and fish tacos mmmmmmmmm ohh and the amazing brews
1,rarely give a business a superior rating but i have to say my wife and i had one of the best dining experiences at the rock bottom brewery   the food was delicious  the beer every recipe sampled  was amazing and the service was wonderful  the staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant please support this business  i guarantee you will not be disappointed
1,food was delicious portion size generous atmosphere good our waitress lindy was outstanding have nothing but good things to say would highly recommend to everyone 
1,husband and i got here a couple times a year    always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price   i love their side salad which has raisins and sunflower seeds    burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken mac and cheese   recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat
1,a glorious day in the month of may  my love and i stumbled hungrily into rock bottom  ha just kidding i realized darren w hadn't reviewed here so i had to start it cheesy  the rock bottom line: monday for lunch we had awesome service by ashley  we weren't rushed and it was quite  the burgers were great and half off  the beer was very good  we will be returning for sure
1,a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off service was extremely helpful professional and on point all night lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process if anyone is looking to plan an event i would highly recommend rock bottom couldn't be happier
1,been to fridays i am sure but i enjoy the yucatan salad it's delicious my children love fridays it's usually there 1st choice i also love the cajun chicken & shrimp pasta very very good
1,visiting relatives in somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of homestead  my aunt insisted that we have lunch at uno's pizzeria & grill as the food was delicious  when we arrived i had to admit that i was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place  it was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes  the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease  i settled on a turkey bacon and avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times  they have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages  the food arrived in no time and was delicious  the portions were just right for lunch i was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping  the four of us had items off the two for u lunch menu our bill was less than $30 which meant that i might could afford the shoes i wanted to buy  my aunt was right you cannot visit homestead without stopping to eat at uno pizzeria & grill it is fantastic
1,gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory back before pizza hut turned into a fast food restaurant the pizza hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant and this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out so this is the old style pizza hut very family orientated dining style you can sit here for hours and so we did we had a heap of use in a long tablei ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free disappointed in the selection of that seeing other choices i regretted going on the cheap prices are moderate 12 for a little pizza but with all the dough you get full can't say i walked away hungary nor did i finish my second mini pizza i want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza
1,7 ounce house sirloin is the bomb 'nuff said
1,wife my daughter and i went here for breakfast i got the breakfast special: $5 for french toast and eggs clean great service delicious food you can't beat it for breakfast
1,has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate you get a really big side of home fries too this is probably my favorite place for breakfast in pittsburgh i generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting service is usually fast and friendly two downsides to the place 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience i never remember to have cash until i get my bill so i have to run to the atm 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast the lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either
1,has been a great experience for my kids sean and his staff are amazing can't say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids
1,you for changing my life
1,being disappointed with a karate school on the far north side i began looking for another place to train i happened across arizona family karate academy and i must say the instructors there are top notch they take the time to work with you to educate you and to make you feel special i can make up classes whenever needed and  in the three months i've been going there i haven't yet found them to be closed due to some family emergency or out of school function both ms pam and ms angelica are dedicated to ensure that you get the most benefit in your class they work with you one on one and make sure you are comfortable during class they genuinely care about you i've also seen what they do with children of all ages and i am very impressed the school also has great specials (a "try before  you buy") and participate in most local community activities (and never need to close the school to do so) i'm impressed and proud to be a member of this "family" and feel that i have made good friends with both the instructors and fellow students
1,like the fact that the karate classes are structured so that they cater to beginners as well as to kids with advanced belts some of the belt requirements are even posted on the group's website i also am impressed with ycoa's emphasis on self-defense in case kids get approached by strangers who wish to do them harm
1,love the programs offered at yong champions of america they keep the programs affordable while still giving great attention to each member of the class the coaches seem knowledgeable on the arts and i trust their abilities to teach the classes are affordable but we all know life happens sometimes and the scholarship opportunity has been a huge help i am so thankful that the focus of the program is on each student's opportunity to perform and improve not on creating competition and tension with karate cheerleading soccer and dance i know there are plenty of opportunities for trying new things
1,programs offered at young champions of america are incredible for so many reasons  they are very affordable and the instructors pay great attention to each student  it gives each student a great amount of confidence and there are so many different activities to try  there is so much room for personal growth and development for all students  boredom is not ever a possibility for anyone here
1,was beyond impressed with the level of dedication these coaches have  the programs are top notch and the kids actually learn to develop inner strength along with their physical strength  so much better than babysitting them with video gamesthe fees are so reasonable i really am amazed at the quality of what these kids are learning  i love that this is available in times like these and especially in this kind of weather
1,techniques that my nieces and nephews learned were amazing they were a little apprehensive at first but the staff was very professional and made them feel like they were getting better the work ethic that they instill in these kids is simply incredible they are patient kind and most of all affordable i was not sure how long they would be apart of the program but they and the teachers both surprised me i've always believed that knowing how to defend yourself is something everyone should know and this is place to start for younger kids
1,writing this review as a alternate perspective of mmac because one star in my opinion is grossly underrating the value of the dojo sensei rick is dedicated to the art of martial arts as well as the sport he focuses on the basics knowing that a strong foundation in karate is what leads to strong fighting in this dojo there are many philosophies but the essential one is to always "kick punch sweat" the dojo is made up of hardworking individuals and the path to a blackbelt is not for everyoneif you were to talk to sensei you would see he is dedicated to the community; each year the dojo participates in toy drives and hosts a karate kamp; which is an opportunity for kids to participate in karate during the summeri believe the best way to get a sense of the dojo is to visit it yourself; it is kept neat and clean and even features a study center so that students can also focus on their academics between training i highly recommend mountainside martial arts
1,son has been in attendance at mmac for more than 5 years now and changes have certainly taken place within the organization  this dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata kumite (sparring) and basics  it is also set as a traditional japanese dojo teaching wado ryu karate  this is not a cut-throat plaza mall dojo like the cobra kai in "karate kid" that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation  if you are looking for a fight club look elsewherethat being said my son specializes in fighting here and does very well  he has participated in over 30 tournaments in az ca ut co and nv  he has won several of these and usually medals at every event he is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing  i am confident in his abilitiesthe dojo is restructuring and growing and all for the better  it has the best workshops training clinics guest speakers and real tournament training by far  i couldn't be more proud to recommend it to anyone looking for polished and professional traditional japanese technique and practical self-defense instruction
1,is an asset to the ahwatukee community providing traditional martial arts training where discipline is learned and advancement is earned this is a traditional japanese dojo where everyone doesn't get a medal and you don't buy your child's blackbelt in 2 years; enablement entitlement and excuses are not tolerated my son has been training with the sensei's of mmac since 2006 starting in their program held at the ahwatukee ymca at the age of 7 anyone who has met my son will attest to his maturity balance and discipline and i attribute much of that learned behavior to his dedicated training at mmac
1,dojo with patient sensai my son's have been going here for three months now and love it they are an easy business to work with and are great with kids highly recommended
1,say enough great things about this place my 14 year old son has taken jujitsu here for the last 2 years  the instructors are amazing and the staff is very professional
1,used to train in this dojo as a teenager a couple of years ago ray hughes sensei has got to be one of the best role models in the martial arts community both hughes sensei and tyler sensei are incredible with kids they keep their attention make the classes fun but most importantly they properly teach their students how and when to defend themselves the programs are not only for children but for all ages including adults in fact there are several intense seminars dedicated to adult training focusing on developing both the mind and body to properly defend itself basic class setup: starts of with stretching cardio basically a quick warmup next a quick meditation (the dojo is a stress free environment meditation is to help calm your mind) then you go through basic form drills (to ensure you have correct footing hand placement and momentum) towards the end there might be sparing drills (safety first all students are required to wear padding for arms legs and a mouth guard) class is finished off with another meditation to unwind the body the main focus of the dojo is teaching wado but there are other floors dedicated for jujitsu and other martial arts programs great clean facility near the ice den so plenty of parking located in a safe area quality wooden floors in the smaller rooms and padding on the main floor to ensure maximum safety clean cold water fountain air conditioned fans to circulate air well lit spacious locker rooms clean bathrooms well stocked inventory with padding and gis (uniforms) for all sizes no contracts just a monthly payment if you dedicate yourself to the classes and really want to learn then it is well worth the money
1,was a wonderful dojo for our family my son was there through his purple belt my daughter through blue we spent many many hours there and i cannot sing their praises enough i appreciate all of the teachers especially sensei tyler and sensei ray they are patient yet firm their traditional dojo is the real dealafter years of practicing there when my son decided to leave the dojo to try something else he went to sensei ray to talk to him about it ray was gracious and encouraging to my 10 year old son it made all the difference in the world that is the type of outstanding character sensei ray has my son still remembers what they talked about and knows the door is open for him to come back anytime
1,love love love this place and i'm grateful to yelp reviews for sending me in their direction it's only fitting that i add to the reviews my 4 year old daughter attends the pee wee karate two days a week and she loves it the two teachers ray and tyler are incredibly funny entertaining and know how to relate to kids phenomenally truly i enjoy watching the entire class just to see the teachings and interactions between the sensei and students the price is reasonable for classes especially if you partake in the twice weekly option they're flexible about makeups toomy daughter is learning karate but also gaining confidence in a beautiful way it's hard to describe but her experience is so much more than just karate she's learning to speak in front of a group getting exercise having manners instilled more and having fun at the same time from what i gather talking with other parents there are a lot of satisfied families who have been customers for many many years i look forward to doing the same oh and they had a halloween party (2014) and i was blown away at the event they put on it just goes to show how much they truly love these kids it had so much (tons of food light show music contests awesome prizes laser tag in the parking lot and more)
1,young and his black belts continue the professional karate center tradition in henderson  his abilities as a leader and a teacher are second to none  i have known and trained with c-d young for 18 years and he is one of the very best and brightest martial arts instructors aroundyou and your family will receive the very best in self-discipline self-defense and character building  you'll also have a great time as part of the professional karate center family
1,am a 53 year old woman i began taking karate classes at c-d young's professional karate center in september of 2012 i started as a white belt as everyone does in the beginning i resoned that karate would be a good physical outlet for my well being before long i recognized so many more benefits i began to notice a growth in my self confidence along with a sense of accomplishment which sparked a feeling of pride in my acheivements i began to have higher expectations for myself i started to push myself towards goals and on feb 2 2013 i earned my yellow belt that is when i realized that karate is much more than a physical work out it is a joy to witness the level of respect between the instructors and the students at any age young or old i am a firm believer that karate teaches focus it helps with self confidence and self-esteem and it pushes you to set and reach your goals through perserverance and it all happens in a fun atmosphere with instructors that are dedicated to show you how to achieve such self growth
1,place is like my family  my 2 kids girl (12) and boy (7) have been apart of this karate center for almost 2 years both kids have grown so confident and continue to learn  this is a the real deal in town  mr and  mrs young are incredible with all age groups   we are so blessed that we found cd young's professional karate center    we love this place
1,to reviewbeen coming here for a while and love it couldn't ask for more family ran place always feel like your welcome and never feels like your just a money sign well worth the investment raising good humans here
1,and mrs young are absolutely amazing they are professional loving creative and it has been a pleasure sending my son to their classes it's been a sad day since we had to move and i couldn't drive the distance any longer if you are looking for a family environment to learn from the best then go see mr young  -chelsea and lincoln sheaffer
1,karate center everhighly recommend attending teachers are firm but fair facility is good and students are friendly
1,recently moved to the neighborhood and my 9 & 16 year old had no friendsjoining cd youngs karate class not only boosted their self esteemthey were also able to make friends mr young has made us feel like family
1,love this place mr and mrs young are phenomenal unfortunately we were only able to stay a month due to unforeseen circumstances but my son improved so much in that month i was hesitant on group classes but each student gets the perfect amount of time spent with them my son truly developed in one month i will also say the atmosphere here is just as wonderful as the owners this is definitely the place to go for karate in henderson  you will not be disappointed
1,started at go for it usa because of coach ed he was my then 4 year old's coach at a community center class and when classes stopped for the summer my son wanted to keep going so we went to the gym and signed up for ed's class my son loves coach ed and the gym he always enjoys his classes and is growing stronger every day i only intended to keep him at the gym through the summer months but then my 8 year old saw the boys team practicing and decided he wanted to do join too so here we are a year later and my boys really love the gym we live in south las vegas but i drive there because that's where they want to be compared to other gyms with the same programs their cost and class selection can't be beat tammy at the front desk is really friendly and always helpful as is the whole staff they really care about the kids and it shows in everything they do and in all the programs they offer this summer (2013) we've had the opportunity and need to use the drop in day-camp and my kids really had a great time and look forward to every chance they get to attend the camp and really any other activities they offer we also did a birthday party there for my youngest when he turned 5-he chose the gym- and all the families that attended had a great time and couldn't believe how much fun it was to have a party at a gym and what's more the older kids (12-13 years old) in attendance had a blast too my now 9 year old started with coach ed too it was his choice and he really enjoyed ed as his teacher he's now on boys team and likes his new coaches dave nalani and kyle who always encourage and challenge him  if you're looking for a gym for your child go for it usa is the best place for the perfect balance of fun and structured learning they have so much more to offer than just gymnastics
1,daughter has been in go for it for several years now and they have been so good with helping my daughter j'lyn xcel in gymnastics the staff are very friendly and easy to work with i would recommend gfi to all my family and friends
1,have two children who have attended classes here with the matthews and all i can say is they are part of our family now and forever my children respectadmire and truly love this family they have given so much to us and really have helped raise our children to be dynamic indiviuals with morals and respect i recommend them every chance i get
1,accepted my tiny tiger at 25 years and mrs matthews is awesome with the kids especially my little one if there is one thing i have to complain about is the class running late from time to time in some cases understandable but most cases just a little frustrating not enough to take a star away
1,we first started almost 4 years ago i thought it would be a great way to keep the kids active and learn self defense  it turns out much more than i expected not only is their bodies strong but so is their mind  they learned life skills like respect loyalty discipline perseverance  integrity to name a few the kids have worked their way up in ranks and one made it to a state champion and is working extremely hard to make it to the worlds championships both kids are straight a  students and were not when they first started with rico's  what the kids have learned is to have goals in life and they must work for it (short or long term) i am proud of who they are becoming and how they are dedicating themselves to a life of successi would highly recommend rico's martial arts to any parent
1,checking out other gyms throughout the valley it was clear that rico's martial arts was where we wanted to be we chose mr rico not only for the martial arts aspect for teaching self defense but the leadership program he offers the lessons in life skills are nothing but superior students are taught self defense respect self discipline and confidence mr rico is not only concerned about progress in his program he takes high interest in his students education  this was a very wise investment for us and we recommend it to everyone stop by and watch one of the classes you will not be disappointed 
1,your child is timid lacks confidence and you want them to be more disciplined respectful and active rma is definitely what your child needs  they have the best instructors my now 5 and 7 year old boys have been attending the classes for almost a year now  and wow what a huge improvement in all the areas mentioned above my boys love attending the classes and they are pumped about being in the leadership classes now thanks rma  this has become part of our family and lifestyle now
1,son was never interested in any sports  when a friend invited him to an open house at rico's he really enjoyed it  for this summer we thought we would give him a few weeks to decide if it was for him  on his first day of instruction it was clear it meant he fit in somewhere and was welcomed  now he's learning respect and honor and his behavior has really improved  he is not only learning self defense but gaining the confidence that will keep him from being a target to be picked on  he comes home from school every day with the focus to work on his studies so he can get to class at rico's martial arts  i could go on and on about the many things our family has gained in such a short time with ricco's help but what i love most is how all the instructors and even the parents of all the kids are so pleasant and really make your whole family feel like you are part of something great for all the kids
1,a difference this has made for my adhdvery active son it has given him focusdisciplinerespectconfidencemotivation he is in leadership program so he is there almost every weekday mrr and mrs rico's obviously are passionate about martial arts and kids yesit is pricey like all martial arts but well worth having a son who is focuseddisciplinedand respectful
1,son jacob has been attending rico's martial arts for 4 12 years sincehe was 3 years old we feel that because of being a part of this rmafamily that jacob has become extremely mature for a 7 year old and haslearned to appreciate all types of people despite their age or abilitythe students at this studio range from 3 to adult and all have a mutuallove and respect for each other it is truly a family my husband and iconsider mr and mrs rico to be second parents to jacob over the yearsas in times of trial they have shared in helping us set goals andconsequences for our son and they provided another solid example forhim to follow of what is right and wrong the children learn disciplinehonor integrity and the importance of helping others and doing well inschool i highly recommend this martial arts studio to anyone
1,really great traditional chinese martial arts school definitely the most prominent in las vegas as well as the most complete welcoming and inclusive the students range in age from 6 or so to elderly people and the breadth of available classes ranges from gentle qigong and yang tai chi chuan through more challenging chen family tai chi and ba gua zhang all the way to the most challenging acrobatic northern shaolin and praying mantis kungfu it's not chopsuey kung fu or one of those stripmall colored belt factoriesit's the real deal and they really do serve the local community with lion dancing at the new year as well as outreach programs and a strong spiritual emphasis at the center of the curriculum not just a meathead asskicking school but i wouldn't recommend you starting any shit with them either
1,about lohan schooli went there from a suggestion of a friend of mine this place is run by sifu steven baugh and i knew that nameit turned out sifu my friend in jr high school's dad raul teaches there as well it's a very welcoming environment people there are friendly and teach many aspects of kung fu lohan is a non profit school which made it very appealing because they weren't trying to sell me a 200 dollar outfit or buy weapons in the black market i loved going to the spiritual warrior classes the community service they do is very admireable i've seen them on fox 11 news and doing lion dances during chinese new year they have been to clubs to ward off the evil spirits and promote prosperity and health i think sifu is a great spiritual and community leader this will be good for kids to help build their self esteem and get in shape for the great war with the outlandersuh whoops this isn't mortal kombat
1,have been studying with sifu baugh since 2003  my only complaint is that i didn't find him before 2003  i have been studying since the 80's and i have studied with some disreputable teachers  sifu teaches: chen tai chi yang tai chi northern and southern forms of kung fu praying mantis xing yi ba qua and other forms of traditional kung fu  unlike other teachers and schools i have attended sifu baugh is approachable and humble  he teaches the majority of the classes and his only concern is helping you to get better  he is respected by other martial arts teachers in town and he even teaches some of them if you are looking for a traditional kung fu school with: experienced and qualified instructors reasonable monthly fees no annual contracts many different styles and classes no ego and a place that you can train for the rest of your life then this is the place to train
1,have been a part of the lohan school of shaolin for 4 years now and it has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life when i first heard of the school my father took me in to watch the kung fu class and when i walked in i felt this really strong positive energy and right then and there i wanted to join the school is like a second home to me and the students are like another family if you are looking for a good traditional kung fu school this is definitely the place to go
1,really into this bar but only every now and then they get a lot of the same kinds of requests and they usually play them on rotation each weekend so i wouldn't recommend coming every weekthe musicians are good and have lively personalities to make a request you write the song on a bar napkin and walk it up to the stage and drop it on the piano top with a couple of bucks (or more depending on how badly you want to hear your song)ps unless you're a dummy dont' fall for the uofa v asu fight song battle they do this every time i go in and basically drunken bros try to "outbid" one another to hear one song over the other (during the rose bowl etc the respective teams are inserted) anyway i've seen some poor way too drunk fool plop down $100 in effort to have his team song played over another - pretty smart gimmick for the players pretty crappy for the dude who has to to realize "wait did i really pay $100 to hear a song last night"i think the drink prices are steep here but it's a fun time and you're getting live entertainment
1,gotta sayi've been in here a few times and each time i had a great timereally great timesinging along at the top of my lungs to billy joel songs great timehoweveri've always stopped here after bar hopping a bit  this was kinda the last stop and we were all pretty buzzed each time we visited this placei dunnoi have fond fond memories of this place though
1,coworker told us to go here because we are from out of town loved this place the music was awesome everyone is so talented and amazing i was going out with a friend for a couple hours and ended up staying here until closing i definitely recommend visiting this place
1,love this place its great for a fun relaxed night out or for a friends birthday party or what have you the music is good and interactive with the crowd they help get you in a good mood they take requests and do the best they can to sing everything they are asked only once have they turned down one of mine because they just didn't know itif you go early between 5-8 they have fantastic drink specials aka happy hour beers wines wells are 2 bucks everything else is 3 bucks can't beat that :) also the earlier you go the easier it is to find the seat going after 8 it is almost impossible to find a table and standing room is kind of limited people some times say they play the same songs every night and they do because they know them people request them all the time and they are good group singing songs and you have to admit to be up there playing the piano drums or guitar and being to play a song on the spot with no music sheets is pretty awesome
1,big bang is my happy place seriouslyno matter what is going on i can drag some friends out to the big bang have a drink and sing along as the stresses of the day just drift awaysing me a song piano man- i'm in the mood for a melody and you've got me feeling alright
1,place great atmosphere i've been there a couple of times on the weekends and in the middle of the week not exactly a place to mingle as it gets really loud but if youre with a bunch of people you know you should have a nice time last time i went there was on a tuesday and it was actually kinda busy it was my friend's 21st bday and he did the whole getting on the stage thing he tried to dance but he wasnt that drunk yet afterwards someone gave him a 252 which he threw up almost right away it wasnt chunky and it wasnt a lot but rules are rules one of the bouncers followed him to the bathroom a little later and nicely asked us to leave i have never been kicked out of a place in such a polite way before (not that i get kicked out very often) we ended up running into the same bouncer at the cue club a few minutes later and he was cool and took a picture with usall things considered we had a good time don't stop believing piano man and ymca were some of the songs playing and i'm pretty sure i ordered 3 drinks but only got charged for 2
1,i tried coming here one time before and the line was ridiculously long to get in now i have a good understanding of why so many people want to come here it's poppin' i wish they had a place like this in san francisco where there are dueling pianos and drunken college folks who just sing along whether or not they know the lyricscover was $6 i think but well worth it since the drinks are fairly inexpensive (from a city girl standard)$6-7 roughly you can request songs to the pianists but they'll really only get to your request if you throw in a few dollars for tip one lady threw in $20 and her song was automatically played she even got to sit up there with them i would definitely come back to the big bang when i'm in town next bring a few friends get a table in front (if possible) and enjoy the entertainment
1,here with the gf fun and entertaining place to drink and have a good time first of all good luck finding any eating whatsoever two pianos duke it out with classic songs and you can request songs with a tip don't think they only play cheesy showtunes they do at times and sometimes you can just sit there laughing at grown men belting out every word like they are own stage other times they drag unwilling people to stage and make them sing the words all in all a good time minus the arizona heat
1,is way better than karaoke and a thousand times more fun definitely not the scene for people who weren't raised on classic rock if all you love is r & b and the only songs you know by heart are rap you're not going to like it here (as much as i do)i'm always stoked to come here and get to sing a little diddy about jack and diane while together we lament the day the music died and have one last dance with mary jane until the midnight hour when we cried more more more in the very end we'll put bread in their jars and say "man what are you doing here"the big bang is a huge hit with the entertainment truly making this place i've come in here by myself with a large group of people and with just a significant other it doesn't matter who i'm with we're all in here to get great drinks and shout great classic memories along with the (very) talented pianists who all also double as drummer and bassistsguitarists i highly recommend this barrel-of-monkeys type entertainment but beware the language gets foul and we all get a little rowdy and if you didn't understand my paragraph on what gets me so stoked about this place you're not going to "get" why so many people love it here
1,love this place music is great and the artists all provide endless hours of entertainment and fun
1,been a big fan of the shout house basically since they've opened but now it's even better  cover has been reduced only $8 after 7pm and ladies (woo that includes me) are free after 10pm  there's no cover during the week and all the same great entertainmentthe service has also improved big time  i think they got rid of the bad ones and got some good ones in there  they even have a jello shot girl now you can get them with whip cream and everything  another great thing is family nights on sundays my friends have a youngster or two and its always great to find places to take them  it's so cute to see them rockin out to the pianos  oh and so you know its a g-rated show on sundays :) i love the shout house  every place has got its bumps but nothing severe enough has happened to keep me away from this place
1,is a great piano bar great vibe and drunk people falling at the drop of a hat gotta love it
1,rarely write reviews but this is my favorite place in glendale especially if you like live piano playing (i am a pianist my self and these guys are so talented; i could never in a million year do what they do and i have played classic piano for about 12 years)i grew up in glendale and know of only a few places to go on certain nights  however this place is great  i assure you the musicians are great if you have a musical ear and a sense of humor  they can pretty much play anything you request finally they have pretty good drink specials and have very nice bartenders  a sense of humor
1,live this place great drinks awsome entertainment not for the faint of heart profanity a plenty but oh so damn funny the singers will commemorate engagements wedding anniversaries birthdays and promotions (for a tip) such great interactive fun
1,favorite place to go  great happy hour on friday
1,have wanted to go see a dueling piano show for forever i had heard there is a place in tempe off mill but that it gets crowded unless your super early and that didn't strike my fancy  so when a friend said she is getting a group together on a saturday to go check out the shout house at westgate i was all for itwe got to the shout house about 7:30ish and my friend who has been here before had reserved tables for the group and after been there for while a noticed that that is the way to go the place fills up pretty quick and turns into standing room onlyfor me it was a blast i love the look of a baby grand piano and to have 2 on stage next to each other man that was hot and to watch the guys fingers just fly over the keys yea it was a good night for surebut they have more than just piano playing going on they even bust out with the guitar and beat some drums and this amazing chick comes out and just plays her heart out on the violin she was great made playing the violin look cool maybe i should have played that instead of the flute haha  they have good drink prices and even serve food service was kind of slow but she was handling a huge crowd but i suspect that to be the same size crowd every weekendthe crowd had a great vibe everyone smiling and singingshouting along i am a music person so this place was for me but if you don't like loud music or the neighbor next to you singing along as if she is adele but really more like sanjaya  or some impromptu dancing and shouting happening then this might not be the place for you but me it was a great time and i will be back
1,it here best bar at westgatei'm not usually the bar going type but i really enjoy this particular one and i don't feel like people are bumpin' and grindin' all over the place (uncomfortable) came here with some friends last weekend and we all had a great time and its enjoyable for the designated driver as well ;)
1,personally loveee this place me and my friend come here every wednesday for the $1 drinks and sometimes on the weekend the bartender pours really good drinks the pianists are really talented and great at singing and playing the other instruments overall its a lot of fun (:
1,this place getting older (25) not about the dance clubs anymore the music is good the beer is cheap and i always have a good time the staff is awesome to
1,drunks singing public insults friendly atmosphere con: upstairscame here late hour wondering phoenix solo on a business trip stumbled upon this gem by chance i already know the shout house well from the sd location and wouldn't you know it one of the player on the piano was on loan from sd so drinking and singing i managed to get a song in (part of the your world) too bad it was a weeknite and the place closed early next time i am in phoenix i would be coming back for more
1,new favorite breakfast spot in montreal no lineups spacious & most importantly delicious i ordered the crab cakes with eggs oh so good my friends ordered the mexican dish and eggs benedicts their verdicts excellent
1,suggested meeting for brunch at griffintown cafe and we were not disappointed  the wait staff were tremendous and actually let us in out of the cold a little before the restaurant opened  we were there with an infant which tends to complicate things at most restaurants but they were well set up and didn't give it a second thoughtwe tried the bacon and eggs mac and cheese as well as the eggs benedict  the mac and cheese was made with about 4 kinds of cheese and topped with their homemade bacon (which is amazing) and two perfectly poached eggs  it was heavy but delicious  the eggs benedict was also incredible  not too much hollandaise and homemade bacon instead of ham  the kicker was a homemade biscuit for the base  it all came together very nicelygriffintown cafe was very kid friendly with amazing food and excellent staff  we couldn't have asked for a better brunch and will definitely be back
1,boyfriend and i found this place on yelp and went for brunch during a weekend trip to montreal  it was fantastic  he ordered the huevos divorciados and i had the bacon egg mac & cheese  being from texas we were leery about ordering a mexican inspired dish- but we were not disappointed  the dishes came out piping hot- a very important factor for a delicious breakfast  we ate at the bar and we spent a couple of hours lingering after our meal visiting with the staff the chef and his wife  we had plans to go visit a couple of museums but we ended up spending the entire afternoon just hanging out at griffintown a happy accident and a very memorable sunday afternoon
1,been here a few times for breakfast and once in the evening so i'll split the review in to two: breakfast - while there's always a line up it's well worth the wait the place is noisy but that's just because it's one big space (including all the seating the bar and the kitchen) and popular i don't find it a problem but if you want a quiet spot to escape the noise then you don't want to come herewhile you're waiting for a table try to squeeze in at the bar to order a coffee (it's really good here) - it makes the wait that much more bearablethe g biscuit with bacon is my favourite savoury meal - it's not too big super tasty and cooked to perfection on the sweet side i really like their french toast - nothing too crazy just solid french toast goodnessevening - much more chillaxed i had the burger and pint wednesday special for $18 and wasn't disappointed the burger patty is a mix of beef lamb and duck and tastes as good as it sounds i can't remember what beer they have on tap but it's good
1,me up for a weekly eat here please someone please arriving starved after a morning train ride from ottawa i was seated on the terrasse snuggly wedged into my seat (which was also propping open the door to the restaurant) i got down to brass tacts: bennies and bevies i ordered absolutely positively correctly the house cured wild salmon benny was a perfect blend of salty sweet pickled and smoky flavour and the mountain of potato mash with bites of onions i could have easily eaten double griffintown seems to be a restaurant that enjoys homemaking their wares much to my joyful surprise they also had homemade ginger beer and yes it too was delicious i searched for something wrong with experience but truthfully it was just a big breakfast-at-lunch-time love fest
1,don't mean to bump crystal's review - but we loved this place we love the food the service cannot wait to return again this is an amazing gem we discovered through yelp in montrealgood for groups: if you sit inside it is a small quaint gastropubdinner: i ate the griffintown cheeseburger which is a delicious monsterbrunch: crab cakes with eggs  divine
1,bloody caesar in montreal  yes we were visiting but we had many in different cafes and restaurants we could have drank 20 did we who knowsbreakfast was good i tried the homemade gravlax and yes so good with my poached eggs egg sandwich the scene cool hip and mellow the background music was wonderful loved it i also liked the neighborhood
1,of my favorite spots (: awesome food awesome drinks even more awesome staff
1,great place to grab a tall glass of wine great appetizers and even dessert the atmosphere is relaxing and the hummus is outstanding the cappuccino and the espresso are magnificent
1,don't know anything about wine but i like to support any business that moves into the area so i though i'd check this gigino's outthe ambiance is good and the night we went there was a live guitar player that was really good he played almost the entire time we were in the restaurant the food was fantastic in fact probably the best quality food i've had in the city of goodyear the hummus was great (and free thanks to a coupon that came in the mail) as was the warm pita bread the hummus is a house recipe that is made on site for dinner we got one of their boards and everything was great it was a combination of your choices of meat cheeses and bread that was of the highest quality and tasted fantastic i also had the wine that was recommended by the waiter which was a good fitgigino's is really a one of a kind place in goodyear and hopefully they will be around for a long time
1,who lives in phoenix's west valley knows that our side of the hood isn't exactly err bustling with independent local businesses everywhere you look it's big box stores and chains and while many of the employees are lovely and personable they're just not invested like they are in good old mom and pop shops enter gigino's owned by a real deal italian dude and his lovely wife this place has some crazy good food i'm fairly picky when it comes to my eats so i don't say this lightly -- they made the best panini i've ever had in my life let me back up and set the stage for you a bit i came here with my husband on his birthday intending to have a glass of wine and some tapas -- the valpack coupon offering a free hummus drew me in we entered this restaurantwine bar which is nicely decorated and has a variety of fun different seating options (you can eat at the piano) and were surprised to find it fairly empty on a thursday evening happy hour was going on so we enjoyed some $5 bruschetta a glass of their house wine special for me and a big craft beer for the birthday man the italian owner whose name i can't recall was very attentive and chatty without being overbearing and when he found out it was my man's birthday he proceeded to bring us two comp glasses of champagne nice after enjoying our sips and snack we decided to dive in to the paninis we ordered two -- one with prosciutto sun dried tomatoes and a few other things i can't recall which was great and one manchego cheese some type of delicious meat fig jam and pears grilled on sourdough that was out-freakin-standing oh my goodness eat this right now i savored every bite of this panini and told pretty much everyone i know and work with about it for dessert we had a pastry with nutella which was also tasty but didn't compare to the panini overall i'm a huge fan of this place great service authentic people and food and locally owned i sure hope they make it here because i am looking forward to years of paninis mmm
1,a wonderful and cozy little wine bar just around the corner from home with a warm and genuine owner-operator staff that are more worried that you have a pleasant experience than giving you a check and the door  a constantly changing wine list with suggestions and pairings that come from a staff that learn to know your likes and dislikes  want to buy a bottle but don't want to get a dui on the way home  they'll mark your bottle and keep it there for you or recork it for the ride home  the food is all fresh ingredients with well matched flavors  love it
1,great place to grab a tall glass of wine great appetizers and even dessert the atmosphere is relaxing and the hummus is outstanding ps the cappuccino and the espresso is also delicioso
1,great local family owned small business find  i just happened to be driving back from la was hungry checked my around me app and found this little jewel  fantastic wine list great lite bites met the owner and her (willing to work harder than most adults i know) kids  loved the piano playing in the back ground  it is not often in az you find this kind of stuff with out spending an arm and a leg  in this time of financial uncertainty christy and her family are making it work  if you live or are visiting the goodyear area for spring training a wedding or what ever reason please check this place out   it is small businesses like this that keep our country runningmy personal thought please leave your kids at home this is very much an adult night out kind of place
1,thought it might be odd to write a review about a spiritual spotbut sometimes i feel macy's is my personal heaven so here goes for those of you looking to connect deeper with yourself and the world and want a non committed affiliation check this place out its not your typical church experience- the place is founded on science of mind which is nottttttttttt scientology or even close if you have seen the secret read books by louise hay or hopped on the power of now wagon you understand the basic teachings of the law of attraction and changing your thinking changes your life anyways it is a perfect place to set aside an hour on sunday to get back to basics you can believe in any higher power and be cool here the people are nice don't corner you and the talk is always relate able to real lifewishing you all the best on your own journey
1,uncle rick is a member of this church so when my grandfather passed away naturally he wanted to do a memorial to grandpa at his place of worship i'm not a religious person but i did come here one other time with my uncle (i took a world religions class and rick took me here) my first impression is that its such a beautiful church with symbols of various religious icons and a laid back atmosphere the people seem to genuinely love it here and feel comfortable being in the presence of their pastor() rev mitzi lynton she was well spoken not pushy and not saying "god this and jesus that" she told the congregation my family to take a deep breath and say your own prayer for him as he was a fatherhusband brother grandfather brother-in-law father-in-law etcyou get the idea i found that t o be super they put up a few appetizers with water tea and wine and gave our family room to mingle and greet eachother etcthe girls who helped were on top of everything they respect one anothers  faith and belief system i definately think i will be going back and checking out a real service thanks to my uncles friends who helped with everything from food song choices flowers and loving support
1,place is amazing they welcome every human being there was no judgment just acceptance there was no negativity just positivity i went in with apprehension i usually go by the philosophy "take what you like and leave the rest"when i left i actually took 100% of my experience with me which included a smile
1,people open their hearts and welcome everyone your not just tolerated you are accepted and loved they don't shove religion down your throat they teach love they are science of mind not not not scientology not anything like it if you are lookinng for an up beat spiritual experience go there i am so happy to have found clf
1,my beliefs are different than them as i am christian the attitudes and behaviors i have seen here are heads and shoulders above what i have experienced at many christian churches i have attended on a regular basis and greatly enjoy my time and experience here on the sundays that i am able to attend they are open and accepting of all people there are different lifestyle's that i don't necessarily agree with but it is not my place to judge but to treat with respect and dignity that each human being deserves this is what i see here rev michelle is a class act and a genuine caring person life is to short to condem others and that does not be occur here
1,psycho jock my company was having a hard time finding someone who could embroider one of our logos and still make it look classy not only did psycho jock pull it off they did it in a very short time frame john one of the owners actually came all the way down to our office (a 45-60 minute drive) on a saturday to bring us samples then one of the employees met me half way to deliver the shirts great customer service plus high quality work i'm a fan
1,experience with psycho jock on my low volume order they make good on the customer service claim that they service "needs as small as 1 hat to 5000 shirts" as i only wanted two shirts done and they treated me as if i was getting 200 hundred neal is awesome he listened to what i was looking for and his communication was fast and professional the whole thing from first communication to finish was done in around a week which met our extremely tight deadlines i had never had embroidery of our logo done and neal created sew-outs in two sizes so i could pick the best one for my project we selected the one that met our needs and the final product turned out great very proud of the shirts that psycho jock created for us can't wait for our next trade show when i can show them off hoping we can find some more stuff to do and come back to psycho jock

1,needed a single item printed and forrest was super helpful he even had me email him the text and had it ready to go when i got there with the sweatshirt i'm sure single items aren't the norm but next time i have a bigger order i'll be bringing it to them too
1,great shop in a great part of townyarnhouse has it all a great selection of needles (chiagoo dpns are my favorite) fantastic yarns and very fair prices  the best thing about it is when i go to yarnhouse i get to visit with chris  he's fantastic down to earth and not at all pretentious as some yarn store employeesowners seem to bei especially love how many great local yarn lines and indie dyers that chris stocks  in a city with so many choices as far as yarn shops go chris is always the first one i visit
1,love this place i found it today and had a one on one lesson in crochet chris was so patient and kind i left with some great new tools to help me stay on track and a boost of needed confidence this place is so awesome they have crochet and knitting circle meetings on wednesday nights at 6pm i can't wait to try it out thank you chris i am so excited about my new project
1,adore yarnhouse i've taken two classes there that have been incredible really small class sizes with great individual attention for your needs i've also just walked in and asked for help with a pattern before even though i didn't buy the yarn at their store chris helped me figure out the issue i was having and let me sit there for more than an hour while i took out my stitches and tried again he's also helped walk me through what kind of yarn would be good for different products and even helped me fix a crochet afghan that was literally falling apart at the seams even though i know that i could find cheaper yarn online or at a big box store i would never get the help advice and great customer experience that yarnhouse gives me
1,amazing serviceand really cared  my sons team lost his jersey and we were scrambling last minute to get him a number on the only one left i called bowdacious and they took such good care of us last minute i would highly recommend them
1,bought two "members only" jackets and took them here to have a family member's race team's logo embroidered on them for christmas gifts spectacular finished for less than half the original quote and the embroidery is perfect
1,have been a customer since before chad took over in 2009 i have always received excellent customer service and my embroidery has always turned out perfect he is very good at matching the stitch color
1,in a dress i had made for my daughter that i wanted monogramed they were wonderfultook the dress and matched up thread and they showed me a couple of designs on computer even though it was a small job they took the time and made sure it was exactly what i was looking for picked up dress and couldn't be more pleased it was just what i was looking for excellent customer service
1,about going the extra mile  i sent the owner (chad) some clipart that he couldn't use and had to redo  he added detail to some of it when he redid it and it looks fantastic  he charged me what i consider to be a very fair price  i placed my first re-order yesterday and since he kept my designs on file i know that my second order will come out as well as the first  i love supporting a local business (8 miles from home) and i especially love supporting a local business that does great work
1,order varsity tennis uniforms every year and their product is great they are always on time and never have any excuses the guy is very professional and never gets upset ;) if you need a reliable place go to this one
1,recently had to go to american stitch due to a huge mess up on about 50 out of 150 football jerseys wrong names misspelled names wrong numbersyou name it and it was wrong after going to 6 different sports stores giving me ridiculous pricing we found american stitch matthew fixed them for less than half of what other places quoted and they looked great he put a rush order on them so we could have our players in full uniform before the next game great customer service and great price
1,love this place the work they do is amazing quality fast and cheap matthew is always so nice and everything he does is fantastic i first took my jacket in to him and it turned out amazing and whenever i need something else needed to it it just keeps getting better he is so caring and nice and you know he will go beyond what you expect i love this place if you ever need an embroidery or anything go here
1,customer service i needed 12 shirts embroidered for march madness and found this location on yelp due to a slight meshap chad informed me 4 shirts tore slightly he offered to order exact replacements overnight no charge ($180) or gave the option of nike replacements i chose the nike and they looked great the fact that chad didn't try to pass the cost on to me showed how he was all about service- kudosi recommend his business- thanks again chad
1,was great i love american stich 2 needles up
1,of the few places i found to do small embroidery jobs  i've used american stitch for the past three years for name embroidery on school provided backpacks  they've always been professional and they've been willing to accommodate a rush order during back-to-school season when they're swamped with uniform embroidery  end product always looks good and they even show me the setup on the software they use so i have idea of how it will look before hand

1,is a review for holiday inn express- greentree (april 7th)it's the remodeled best western inn the new holiday inn greentree is beautifully remodeled and closely located to all the fun in downtownthe rooms come equipped with a microwave & fridge balling tired of take out there's a giant eagle (grocery store) in walking distance can you say convient free breakfast buffet for the guest say what think p diddy status when you walk though the door and everyone is your fonzworth bentley when i return back to "the burgh" i will definitely return back to this hotel
1,place was great the rooms were clean and spacious the decor was modern and fresh the staff were all great and would bend over backwards to help anyway possible plus they had a free shuttle van to take you back and forth from the ball games
1,have been a subscriber to the pittsburgh opera for 5 years  i have also attended the opera in other cities most notably new york city and sidney and i feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in pittsburgh  the season usually provides lots of variety and the artistic standards are very high  the benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building  the acoustics of the benedum are also really excellent  the super titles are easy to read from just about any seat  the orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully  i also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the pittsburgh opera
1,the past five years i've been to this convention center four times and have enjoyed each time here it's an impressive and well maintained building that provides both locals and out-of-towners with a good impression of the city the first time at the center i lived in nc and was attending a big work event here i was very impressed by the architecture of the center but sadly wasn't in an area where i could see beautiful views of the city after moving to pittsburgh i came for the annual home show and auto show though i liked both shows the auto show was a bit more impressive i hear that the home and garden show is a must-attend finally i came here for the boden liquidation sale yesterday the views from the line to enter (where i sat for a looong time) were absolutely stunning the section of the center overlooked the river and the north shore with a bridge flanking both sides of the view i didn't mind the wait just because i could admire the view i look forward to coming back for the home and garden and auto shows in 2014
1,love this place  it is less expensive than area hotels:  for less than the price of one normal hotel room at a hotel located in a less desirable area you get your own apartment nestled comfortably in shadyside  you really become a resident of the area and don't feel much like a guestthe customer service was great over the phone  we were given the university rate for the room due to my father's affiliation with pitt and that made a good deal even better  there's fancy cable enough room that a family of four won't trip all over each other and one of my favorite hoods within a short walking distance  i love this place  i recommend it without reservation  truly
1,husband and i went to visit my nephew at carnegie mellon  it was our first time in pittsburgh so we wanted something close to him  the shadyside inn was perfect for our stay  we are very very well traveled and are extremely selective about where we stay  i can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back  in fact we tried but the dates we wanted were completely sold out :-(the location is perfect and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on walnut street  you don't even need a car  the inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings so they are all equipped with well-stocked kitchens (my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that)  the front desk person was sweet and friendly  not only did he check us in immediately he gave us a "breakfast bag" full of muffins juices and granola bars  then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite even tho we only booked a studio   well when we got into our room not only was it a suite but it was a 2 br suite  i couldn't believe it  it was bigger than our apartment back home  right then and there i wished we were staying longer - like a monththe suite had a giant flat screen tv a big dining area with room service menu free wi-fi and super comfy furniture  the bed was to die for  the only thing that didn't go was the older un-renovated bathroom tiles & fixtures but it really didn't bother us at all because the shower water pressure was great  there is ample parking out back and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteouswhen we checked out they were renovating the main office so it's nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve  checkout took less than 30 seconds  i handed her my key and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill since i used my credit card to book  everything went so smoothly and the staff was so wonderful  we loved our stay here and would come back in a heartbeat
1,you first drive up to shadyside you don't expect much but we were very much happy with what we got  the parking lot does have a steep driveway but not too bad  we went to the lobby and we were met by two ladies who immediately offer us water and cookies before leaving the lobby we were given a bag for a sunday breakfast  in the bag bottle of orange juice apple juice two small muffins two granola bars and mints  the room we were put in look like a small  apartment  living roomdinning area and kitchen  it also had two separate bedrooms one was a single and the other was full  this place was very clean and comfortablethis is my second time in pittsburgh the first time we stayed in a hotel we had to pay for parking go to an elevator to take us up to the lobby and take another elevator to get to our room and had to pay for wi-fi  i would recommend shadyside and would love to stay there again and again
1,a year for the past 10+ years we've been staying here  you cannot beat the location  you can walk to shops and restaurants and the area is safe  the staff has always been above average  a few years ago the rooms were rundown but since they have renovated and the rooms couldn't be better  a hotel doesn't give you that much room - you literally have your our own apartment  i was there last week because a family member died  we were having relatives visit us at shadyside inn and the staff went out of their way to deliver chairs to our rooms  our rooms were cleaned every day and there are very few places that allow dogs - and they do  their prices are reasonable and i wouldn't stay anywhere else while in pa  thank you shadyside
1,got a great price from expedia similar to hotels in the area but here you get a great apartment style place with full kitchen living room and two bedrooms (great for kids)  fresh cookies and bottled water on check in and a small breakfast bag for the morning parking is tight but within walking distance of some decent restaurants and shops well recommended
1,place is awesome immaculately clean lots of natural light in every room of the enormous suites modern decor great location and amazing customer service you really feel like you are at home such a wonderful experience i will definitely be a returning guest
1,stars all the way front desk attendant "christian" went above and beyond the call of duty he has a great attitude and is very personable he is an asset the the holiday inn brand we were grieving the loss of loved one and he was completely compassionate we can tell he loves his job  i will always stay at holiday inns for now on
1,hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful there were a few customer service issues i had that i'd like to mention so that others are aware 1- i booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website i have a military id and requested the military discount i was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told i only needed to present my id upon arrival unfortunately when i arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that i could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate that i could only have two of them i pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that i was quoted bad way to start a fun occasion2- i emailed back and forth with tracy bernstein about specifics that i needed for this gathering i was hosting (ipod player microwave fridge early check-in) i was told these things would be ready and they were not we never got the ipod player microwave or fridge bad customer service tracynow i'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at holiday inn city center 1- very clean and modern i loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography2- the rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle3- jay jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful he arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price i've been told he has the "hookup" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special 4- adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me he offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for free are you serious free he even came by the room to make sure we got all that i requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm we very happily toned it down by that point the stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great i really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special
1,stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  if you check my previous reviews i always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when i travel (ihg brand)  while 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake  based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)at least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay  after parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (i wish i remembered her name)  she told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel and i truly believe it our room was 15th floor room 1534  it was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel) and the ceilings were over 12 feet high our king bed was comfy as always and i always fall asleep quickly on themthe hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people  it is located one block from the epicenter and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting    the one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 35 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw wicked and it was fantastic)  other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown  in the beginning of my post i said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the holiday inn brand hotels  for anybody looking into hotels i suggest you sign up for their rewards system whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it  hotels reward loyalty and will do a lot to keep you loyal  we did our research and liked the ihg brand (everything from holiday inn express to intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points and price-wise they stay competitive  our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create)  so as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs then stick to it  if you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year they will do a little more to keep you happy and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way when i first started out with my priority club membership i highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost)  the room was only $97 and that really can't be beat  for this location
1,wife booked my son and i for a fatherson weekend to the giantspanthers game i had no idea a holiday inn could be so nice it offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling the decor room location were all 5 stars the front desk and valet parking were top notch i needed to charge my phone and ipad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it after we were done he parked it again with a smilewe will absolutely be back thank you for a wonderful stay
1,location with a warm friendly staff  what more could you ask for  everyone from the valets to front desk staff were wonderful  our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years  when we mentioned we were in charlotte for a sick relative kids in tow and that it was our anniversary they delivered chocolate covered fruit to our room  if you book through their website the prices are very reasonable
1,not one of my more timely reviewsst mary's apparently began its life as the chapel of an orphanage (which itself is no longer standing)  now it is just the chapel which is used for weddings - i suppose other events could take place there as well but weddings are far and away the most popular event at the chapeltake note of that if you plan to get married there (as we did)  we went in late january and they were booked through august  this means that every possible slot was filled - in two-hour increments - more than seven months in advance  in other words plan aheadas luck would have it browsing one page at a time we managed to find a single slot that had been canceled so we grabbed it and that lone factor is what sealed our wedding date (a mere two months from our engagement date rather less than that from the time we went to find a venue)  but we are very glad it did because the location itself rocksnestled just outside the 277 loop on the grounds of thompson park (also the site of the vietnam veterans memorial) the chapel and the park offers a nice respite from the busy-ness of uptown while being close to everything  the trees provide great cover so you barely know you are so close to the city and inside it is like you have stepped back in time  you can even have your organist play a harpsichord (if they are able)since our wedding party was intimate - just the immediate family - we had the whole group entirely on the raised dais which provided a nice treat to everyone rather than scattering them in the pews which would have separated everyone far too much (for larger parties it would certainly be fine)  big thumbs up
1,littel chapel not a church this facility is now only used for weddings and it is pretty good idea and location for that small chapel with large grounds and the weather was great for photos i was a little hurt that i was not shooting my first wedding then later releaved and glad my friend and yeas he is a jock of course explained that his brides mom needed to be the one to chose the photographer i gleamed so ideas from himback to the review this place does have that historic look and fell to it and the cordinator was cool as she could be for our group or one half of to be so disorganized bet she did not plan on being a zookeeper that day she remained as calm as ive seen so she gets high marks totightly scheduled for a party known for lateness not me a caught a ride with the puncual few wich means the groom picked me up ok they give you more than enough time if you get there on time ive said too much about my friends wife and her familymmmuhwhat about the honeymoon good question and i do not want to know my friend is 19 and his bride is in her 20s so they could have stayed in matthews or pineville and saved some monetthanks to everyone for liking my reviews i'm back
1,was my favorite joint in the clt  i have never been to new orleans and because of katrina i probably  won't for awhile but i imagine that this is a pretty good joint even by looziana standards  i always get the blackened platter with chicken and the fish special with one of their rotating toppings usually  one with crawfish and corn and a side of gumbo  mmmmmmmmmm
1,new orleans flavor and great family atmosphere  not pricey and the portions are huge  the fish is fresh and the service is friendly  live music some nights
1,oft favorite joints in charlotte between the jazz band etoufee and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake
1,an excellent meal here last night with friends and family the blackened catfish was delicious and so was the cajun  scampi appetizer  my husband said his pork etouffe' was amazing and he had a large delicious drink to take him through the entire meal  i will make this place a regular when visiting charlotte
1,love this restaurant so far i have only been twice but boy i wish i could afford to go weekly my boyfriend and i just went for valentine's day had a reservation got there a little early and were still seated immediately and in the jazz room too (side note: the female singer they had on valentine's was incredible wish i got her name) my boyfriend and i absolutely love the rolls they give everyone possibly the best rolls i've had at any restaurant for my drink i ordered the chocolate martini my favorite oh and of course a hurricane later also deliciousfor my entree i had the special tilapia with the crawfish topping oh first let me mention the gumbo that comes before the entree is amazing i don't care if it's not authentic who cares about authenticity when the food is that good i ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like "slow down it's not going anywhere" it had a little bit of a kick to it which i don't normally like but the flavor was just too good now back to the entree last time i ordered the same thing but i didn't even try the crawfish topping; i just gave it all to my mom this time however i realized what a mistake that was i've actually never had crawfish before so i have nothing to compare theirs to but it was delicious and i'm already craving more the tilapia like the first time was also to-die-for i will admit i'm biased because i like tilapia pretty much anywhere i go as long as they cook it right but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well he also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did i)unfortunately neither of us were able to leave room for dessert so i have nothing to say about that overall this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in charlotte now the only problem is the parking which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there it's such a tiny place with barely any parking but i'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location the tiny old building along with the jazz music playing makes me feel like i've gone back in time it's such a cozy romantic restaurant definitely a great choice for valentine's day and even my extremely picky high-maintenance boyfriend (i love him but he is) agreed believe me he wasn't lying he wouldn't hesitate to tell me if i picked a bad restaurant lol
1, fried oysters were nice and crispy on the outside and delightfully gooey on the inside the perfect spice for both the oysters and the shrimp  on the main course lay down a bed of rice throw some "jerk like" chicken and two different kinds of red bean delicousness and bam you are set   now i like my food to have a kick but this was what i would call a controlled kick  just enough spice to get the tongue and mouth salivating and begging for more  you could always add some more louisiana hot sauce if you wanted  then to top it off bread pudding oh lordy lord lord the bread pudding soooooooo good  i would go back just for the bread pudding  atmospherestaff:  bo the bartender made a mean hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful  everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely decorated and made you feel comfortable and relaxed  the upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy touch  overall simply wonderful  please give it a try you wont regret it   enjoy-ian m
1,love the cajun queen - the food is great and spicy the live band is awesome and jazzy and it is fun to celebrate and dine with close friends in this bourbon street atmosphere on the second floor (minus the flashing of course)i have been here many times over 20 years and will keep coming back as long as i'm around
1,shrimpfried oystersrbrall brilliant
1,had our first visit last night fun jazzy band great atmosphere but the food was the star of the show fried green tomatoes bbq shrimp shrimp and grits fried oysters all excellent fast polite unobtrusive service too we'll definitely be back a+
1,etouffee  it actually isn't as spicy as i thought it'd be  i got the shrimp chicken and crawfish combo  actually wish i didn't get the chicken (even though it was super tender) i just didn't get as much ricewhich probably would have been really good with the sauces  other than thatpretty cool music by local musiciansgreat ambiance and good times  )if work sends me back out here again i wouldn't mind coming back
1,pretty particular about 'where' i see shows  a crappy venue can kill a good artist and put up a good fight against a great onefortunately the rhythm room needn't worry about quashing the entertainment value of one of their nationally touring acts  and the rr really does get some of the best independent acts on tour  for artists worthy of smallish venues this place should be as legendary as the whiskey in hollywood but unfortunately its located on like the kiddie ride portion of los angeles central phoenixfor a venue they have really smokin deals on alcohol like pbr for $250  considering that you couldn't get that deal anywhere playing live music i consider it a humongous bargain  they have a smoking patio that you can still hear the music during those 5 mins and the venue is easy to get in and out ofit does tend to get crowded once the main act is on especially near the bar but i've never waited more than a couple of minutes for a drink and i can always find a good view of the stagewhen acts like bob schneider come around the place is rowdy  indie acts like vhs or beta and midlake are near priceless to see in such a small jointand sometimes shows that pique too much interest will be moved to their big cousin marquee
1,rhythm room how i adore theei have seen some of the greatest blues legends play here and have never been disappointed   whenever the rhythm room all-stars play i definitely try to make it  they are rockin'  i dig the dancing the bbq (mmmmmm)  and i enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floori do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair  for bands i really want to see i get there before they open get in line get a table then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start  i always have a great time here  and now that you can't smoke it's even better
1,have yet to find a better blues jump blues swing etc venue in phoenixso on the phoenix scale of music venues it gets 5 starsyes it's a dive which is a good thing  no pretentious personalities at the rhythm room cheep beer a decent dance floor decent sound and great music are all that really matter  rhythm room has them all  it kinda reminds me of the foothill (rip) in long beach ca and that's a good thing i miss the foothill dearlyalso what is possibly the best show (mates of state) out of hundreds i've ever seen in many cities across the us  was at the rhythm room
1,place has a great little vibe and fantastic music i have to admit i'm not very hip when it comes to the blues but i definitely enjoy listening to it when given the chance it was a nice change to look into the crowd and see 21-year-old college students to middle age moms to retired couples all getting down and dancing you rarely see such an eclectic mix of people from every color of the rainbow and all ages just enjoying the music the few times i've been there have been quite an experience and i always leave very happy to have found a place like this in phoenix the drinks are super cheap the sound is good and the music is wonderful
1,rhythm room was the first blues bar i visited when i moved here to arizona i randomly showed up for their fall music festival  i saw so many great local acts that i had no idea existed and it was my first introduction to big pete pearson  that guy puts on a great show and always interacts with the crowd and will talk to any random bar patron who wants to praise his performance or just talk music the rr is also really good about showcasing newer bands from all over the country of all genres the drinks are cheap the bartenders are awesome and always show ample cleavage the crowd on any given night ranges from the young hipsters to the aarp crowd who still dress up for a night on the town with cocktails and dancing there is no pretension here  i love this place and everytime i go i wonder why i've been away for so long
1,room- by far phx's best venue it will be no shocker in 2010 when every concert goer in phx becomes acquainted with rhythm room it's going to pick up the slack for phoenix's lack of venueswhich is good b this place is great way better than the clubhouse21+ can actually see the stage i'm rooting for you rsquared
1,to the gallows plays there sometimes my favorite band the place is great cheap drinks and great sound
1,on more than one occasion i found myself coming to this place some acts are quite strange but that's what i go for  also cool bartenders and cool vibe throughout matt white once was playing his show shoe-less just real laid back kind of place although the crowd did get a little crazy during some mean theremin playing by a band whose name fails me at the momentalso if you like pabst blue ribbon look no further
1,to the gallows plays there sometimes my favorite band the place is great cheap drinks and great sound  it is the great musicians that make this place what it is if you get a chance check out the place and 13 to the gallows of course too along with some of the other great western swing and country acts that roll through there
1,went here years ago when i was young and enjoyed dancing i always felt sort of exposed the way the seating was there is that long row of bar stools that makes you feel on display now i prefer listening to music rather than dancing to it (except at home where i often break into dance for no reason whatsoever) so now i say i love you rhythm room you make me feel like goldilocks except without the long walk in the woods and home burglary part you are not to hot not to cold you are just right not to big not to small again you got it right and i haven't even broken a bar stool yet nor have i fallen asleep while at the rhythm room i am done with the young hip scene i use to visit at the emerald lounge before it was turned into a starbucks if i go someplace like that now it always seems too loud and my personal space always feels violated i still feel to young for the lounge act at scottsdale's blahblahblah so where do i fit in where do i fit in where can i go for good music and not stand out like a well just not stand out i dislike big crowds and arenas small venues are fine if you are not the only audience member and will be missed if you need to get up to pee  the beer is cold but my friends who prefer a gin and tonic can also be taken care of the people who work there are nice no attitude and are actually very cool if it gets a little crowded or if you feel like chatting someone up they have a patio finally i have found a place where i can blend in and listen to the music i love bowerbirds check st vincent check now if you could just book grizzly bear it would be true love and i would live happily ever after
1,this place is great  on my first visit i walked in and was immediately greeted by 4 different "hello"'s "welcome"'s and smiling faces  what a warm welcome right off the batit was a little hard to find but once you find it you will be so glad you did  their food is amazing  i have been twice now and have had their pork chops hot links and chicken wings all were perfectly seasoned perfectly cooked and tasted excellent  i was a bit hesitant with the hot links as often they come way too greasy for my taste but these were grilled to perfection and not overly greasy  i was very impressed  i have also tried their dirty rice (spicy and dirty with ground beef great) black eyed peas and their french fries  the fries were just fries but seasoned well everything else was spot on  i really enjoyed their dirty rice  i've had a lot of different types of dirty rice and this was very unique and very tastytheir chicken deserves its own paragraph here  seriously  i order their fried chicken "not battered" so they basically season the chicken and drop it in the deep fryer  omfg  i've eaten my share of fried chicken but their chicken by far is better than anything i have ever eaten easy  in fact my mouth is literally watering as i type this  go eat their chicken the environment was nice low light dark decor great old school tunes being spun by a dj on the 1's and 2's don't worry if you don't eat wheat or gluten just tell them and they will make sure your meal is made without no issues here  very accommodating
1,place had the most amazing meatloaf fried chicken and mac & cheese i also ordered a side of greens which were good but a little too salty for me i don't order meatloaf at restaurants mainly because i know it'll probably be dry or have no flavor but i had this feeling that bobby c's would make it perfectly i wasn't disappointed it had this slight crunchiness on the outside that was like little heavenly crunchy bits the fried chicken beat the pants off of any other soul food restaurant i've been to it was so juicy and to die for the mac and cheese was another hit next time i'm going to order the mashed potatoes and gravy as well the staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was loungy with great old school tunes being played on their nice sound system
1,you like blues this is where you go  period  there's really not much more to say  blues and jazz bands play here almost every night of the week  drinks are cheap and the music's fantastic  check out local favorites andy walo and the surf rock band thee swank bastards playing here  they won't disappoint
1,change a thing about the sand dollar  great music check dive bar check out of the way location check  all these elements make for a true blues bar in a city where artifice has been wrongfully escalated to an art form  music that feeds your soul in a no-frills environment that won't bastardize the experience  out of the way for most tourists if they're any there they love the blues  that's what it's all about so good you can almost taste it
1,great local bar with live music great place to hear rock and jazz off strip so it's easy for locals to avoid the strip traffic the location on spring mountain just west of i-15 also makes it easy for lv visitors to get a local vibe (and cheap beerdrinks)  about a 5 minute ride from center strip they'll even call a cab to get you home
1,absolute coolest place in madison no make that wisconsin  make that the entire midwest  it's not hard to understand why it's called le tigre when the entire place is covered in tiger stripes and fur there are seriously cats everywhere  and the drinks are strong and cheap and so was the beer  it was a little stinky even though no one was smoking it was obvious this place had years of smoke stuck in it's tiger fur which they should maybe steam out or something  or maybe that would ruin the atmosphere  when my buddies want to go out this is going to be my first pick from now on
1,now the purple dusk of twilight time steals across the meadow of my heart high up in the sky the little stars climb always reminding me that we're apart"as we entered le tigre for a night cap "stardust" played on the old jukebox and i was overwhelmed by orange and the comforting smell of popcorn my fiance and i ordered two rum collins cocktails to celebrate our "pre-anniversary" he's been frequenting le tigre and telling me all about it for a few months before i moved here--although he likes to pronounce it "lay tigray" i'll forgive him it's probably not the local style to pronounce it all frenchy-like anyway voila"the medody haunts my reverie and i am once again with you"there was a jolly group of friends sharing drinks around the lounge piano table and another group behind us choosing lots of great oldies on the jukebox fresh popcorn overflowed from the machine in the corner and even after a big dinner we couldn't resist the free snack we had a great chat with the bartender and by the end of the night dare i say we almost felt like regulars that's the kind of bar i lovebring cash--no credit or debit cards leave your ailurophobia at home hit up the jukebox
1,place has great character i've been here at least 5 times and i've only lived here for 2 weeks
1,tigre is a hidden gem i found out about it through a friend who pointed it out to me when i first arrived in town he told me david lynch famously said this is the "best bar in madison" what's most awesome about le tigre are the bartenders the owner has owned three iterations of the bar since the 50s and his son bartends most of the time his son is one of the nicest most genial and quickest bartenders you'll find in town the bar attracts many locals and regulars who come in just to talk with him this is another place you can feel safe coming to if you feel like having a drink on your own (and as a woman it can be difficult to find such places)i don't want to ruin the suprise of le tigre's decor too much but if you are a lover of kitsch you'll love le tigre the bar also has a jukebox filled with songs that have been in it since the owner opened the bar in another location in the 50s some notes: you can't swear in the bar if you have a potty mouth and need to exercise it go to another bar le tigre also is cash-only and there is no atm because the owner doesn't feel safe having one so if you forget cash you've got a bit of a haul to an atm also don't expect draught beers; you can only get beer in bottles here though there is also a full barthis is a local's bar an oddity a place you go to for a kick it is not a  bar that caters to the jet set
1,feel like saying that this bar is a reported favorite of david lynch should be review enough but i'll try to gussy it up with usefulness or some such thing  the odd location in a strip mall with an unassuming storefront seems just right for some reason  as do the numerous tigers tiger prints and tiger carpet which lend themselves to the name  the bartender was friendly the atmosphere cozy and the music classic  drinks were good and cheap  a decently sized (and poured) tanqueray and tonic and a spotted cow will set you back $8  other than the free flowing popcorn there's no food no credit cards and allegedly no swearing though i did manage to catch myself saying "ass" and i didn't even notice i'd said "bitchass bitch" and nobody tossed me out on my can  that doesn't mean you won't be given the bum's rush for your potty mouth  i'll try to do better next time  no log lady to be found anywhere
1,fact: all of the tiger decor is donated my husband and i have been wanting to go here for a long time mostly because of the camp factor it seemed really cheesy and fun turns out it is amazing here is the low-down of why i love this place atmosphere - outside of the very obvious and corny tiger decor this is the kind of place you could come to in a cocktail dress or jeans and a t-shirt and fit in (i know because we saw that exact combination while we were there) if you stay for more than a few drinks you might forget where you are or what time of day it is because it is quite dark inside other than than it is a standard townie bar dressed to the nines complete with obligatory free stale popcorn there is ample parking but you might not want to drive (see drinks)drinks - i got a tom collins my husband got a manhattan these are the types of drinks you should order at this place they make a fabulous no frills strong mixed drink as it should be this is wisconsin after allstaff - i've only ever been there when a younger man was bartending but he was fabulous he was chatty and friendly without being annoying and he had a sense of humor about his white shirt and bow tie take home - le tigre is not only special because of it's camp and decor it is fabulous because they put some crimson lipsick on tired old hole in the wall and made her look like scarlet johansson
1,must go to le tigre  i just love it i do wish they had tap beer and a better selection in  bottles but everything else about it is fantastic  this is the most loungy lounge i've seen inmaybe ever - i don't imagine they've changed anything since the day they opened in like the sixties - including the music in the juke box - 7 plays for $100
1,place is for people who get it if you don't get it you definitely won't get it
1,do not even know where to begin  this might be the greatest bar i have ever been too and i have been to couple  our madison friends wanted to take us here after our early show at indie coffee  they enticed us by saying it's a tiger themed bar in madison's oldest strip mall and it's david lynch's fave bar  so we said lets do it  when we arrived we were the only patrons in the place it was pretty dark inside but not dark enough to hide all the amazing tiger photos paintings furniture and real taxidermfied tigers  the bartenderowner was amazing he looked like al from happy daysjust like this http:the701levelfileswordpresscom2010126a0105349ca980970c011571508c8b970b-320wijpg so you can imagine my excitement he was super nice and just looked like something out of a gangster movie  you know like the guy who knows everything the drinks were cheap so you could get a round for 5 people under 20 bucks  which is amazing and yep you guessed it i was drinking tiger beersthe jukebox was out of this world 7 plays for a dollar and all the records were old and scratchy  which gave the place a really wonderful vibe songs by louis armstrong elvis frank sinatra and tina turner were the soundtrack to our amazing and very memorable nightso the next time someone wants to take you to a bar in a strip mall you better hope it's tiger themed and in madison
1,best little hidden gem in the city they have a classic jukebox bartenders that mix excellent drinks and tigers everywhere i love this place so much just don't swear
1,scottsdale is one of the few areas in the phoenix area that lends itself well to walking and every thursday evening from 7-9 pm for the past 30 years (except on thanksgivings) that's exactly what art-lovers in scottsdale have been doing walking the over 100 art galleries along main st marshall way and throughout old town participate many with artist receptions hosing one giant informal open house several times during the year look for special themed art walks with live music and entertainmentthe perfect way to get out and see scottsdale
1,it is art walk or just any day i love shopping or looking at the galleries in downtown scottsdale i cannot yet say i have even been to most of them because there are so many all of the galleries i have been to have been really cool with amazing one of a kind pieces all of the owners have been very nice to me which is cool i guess i have this stereotype that all people who work in galleries will see i'm young and can't afford anything and will be snooty to me not the case though great way to kill a day and really fun to do the art walk at night which has a great energyollie the trolleyfree
1,per 'season' (yes i know phoenix doesn't have seasons just hot and less hot yet i love it) they have a super art walk  there are street performers free food radio stations  most galleries have wine to sample  makes for a good time not to mention some amazing artwork  i have been known to window shop on a somewhat crooked walk home from the bars its even better when you get to go in
1,of like a warm outdoor version of the national gallery in dc  i would even be willing to say you'll see more interesting collections than what is housed at our dc gallerythere's plenty of southwestern scenes of native americans and the grand canyon but i did manage to admire 2 pricey picassos and multiple paintings of faraway landscapes  the galleries on main st are amazing and have an ecletic collection
1,must do on thursday evening if you're a tourist tons of art galleries feature lots of native american culture sculptures jewelry and some of the galleries have wine expensive- but a great way to appreciate art if you're staying at a local hotel find a golf cart driver they work off tips
1,do i love about club redred owl  it's two venues in one  i am there just about every weekend  if i don't like one band i just walk to the other side of the buildingthe bathroom is clean  retro decor too  nice staff  really hot guys behind the bar :}
1,live music venue in tempe cheap drinks and great bands
1,my girlfriend's birthday i took her to mary elaine's which is a super fancy french restaraunt in scottsdale az my brother has worked there for a few years now and he's been suggesting that we experience it the staff was extremely attentive and pleasant addressing us by name and taking a moment to replace my girlfriend's blue napkin with a black one to match her dress they even brought over a small stool for me to set my digital camera on the restaraunt is situated on the top floor of the phoenician resort and every seat at mary elaine's has a spectacular view of the valleywe let the chef prepare a tasting menu for us and their sommelier (wine expert) paired wines with many of the tastings i will have to consult with my brother to fully explain the dishes served but the food was so fine tuned to perfection that i can not imagine improvement i highly recommend everyone eat at mary elaine's at least once as it is truly the finest experience in dining i can imaginei posted images of our food here  http:wwwsecretstrandlandcommaryelaines
1,can't believe that i am the second person to review this restaurant i may be the last; mary elaine's closes its doors for good sometime this month (feb 2008) perhaps i am the second person because a proper dinner for two (and i mean that that includes a _real_ selection from the best wine list in the city) will cost you $700 to $800 easily the cost of a coach ticket to paris for the real thing but make your reservations in advance dinner at guy savoy must be planned 4 to 6 weeks ahead in case you don't realize it by the time you finish this one i _am_ a food snobi feel a very heavy burden here because mary elaine's has stood for everything i have hoped for in the finest of service and detailed preparation in a dining experience since i was a member of the plaza club also now defunct that i could presume to review this establishment and the professionals who take each and every part of their job as their personal quest in life is totally ludicrous instead of a review i can at best present some of my fondest memories of this wonderful place ok now that i have set the bar high enough for myself let me begin]i can't remember if the team that comprises the army of staff that will serve you at front of house numbers 12 or 21 people but by the time your dinner is over you will have had a dinner to remember for the rest of your lifetake your pick from one of two seatings 6 to 6:45 or 8:30 to 9:15 give the reservationist every last detail of your preferences some of my favorite requests: (1) seat me as far away from that wailing wanna-be lisa addeo who thinks she can replace nancy gee -- she's still singing the exact same songs in the exact same order she was eight years ago in the lobby if i have to hear her make those time-to-say-goodbye octave leaps one more effing time i'm going to kill myself; (2) give us relaxed timing on the courses we're in no rush; (3) my guest does not drink alcohol and is from iran find a formal drink for her that she will appreciate; (4) my guest loves chateaubriand could you scrape some upamong my most memorable experiences:the time todd (manager) knowing my love of late 80's california cabs found a bottle of '88 heitz martha's vineyard and surprised me for my birthday dinnerthe time my guest surprised me by calling in and requested hot sourdough for my bread choice knowing how much i love itthe time our party sat at chef's table in the kitchen and i watched first hand the quietest kitchen you can possibly imaginethe bottle of '62 chateau gran larose that left my mouth black and from which i was still drunk the next daymy one and only ever sliver of louis xiv cognac at $750 a slicethe way nancy gee used to sing angel eyes my favoritethe time sommelier paul introduced me to the rasiney sweet pleasure of lusteau emilin cherrymary elaine's took pride in finding the most extravagant yet excellent ingredients in the entire world it would not be uncommon for the special to include some extremely rare fish that had been flown in that afternoon the wine list boasted 5000 bottles where else could you splurge on a $10000 bottle of champagne (the answer is etienne's different point of view at pointe tapatillo cliffs) what if you feel like having a '60's bottle of lafite rothschild paul and his staff were always happy to obligei'm talking about the subtleties of food preparation such that a single course may have but six or seven bites but each of those is a symphony of tastes that overwhelms the senses on my last visit the sauce chefs had perfected their entries to each course to such an extent that their excellence sometimes overshadowed the main ingredients themselvesit was fun to gulp my entire glass of water to see how many seconds it would take to be noticed and refilled (no more than 15)mary elaine's celebrated what might be called a sacred relationship between a host and his guest you will be missed
1,been going to mary elaine's since it made its debut years ago and it has never let us down when it closes its doors april 5th it will be the end of an era i agree with mike's comments and remember well the plaza club but mary elaine's has always been in a league of its owngreg the master sommelier became a friend through the years and never failed to introduce us to exquisite wines that he would often set aside for us or give us a call when something special arrived so we'd be sure to make a reservationthe chef's table todd greg nancy gee -- we still miss her and we'll continue to miss them all  the last i knew years ago when todd departed he was going to launch a restaurant somewhere on central does anybody know if he's still in town and was his then-new venture successful i was surprised and a bit disappointed that mary elaine's is closing with a whimper i thought perhaps one final blow-out on april 5th would have been a wonderful way to bid an appropriate farewell to a grand ladyformal elegant dining is clearly on the wane and while there are many excellent restaurants in the greater phoenix-scottsdale area mary elaine's will always stand alone it will be missed
1,elaine's was like nothing my boyfriend and i had ever done it's not really our style but we had a great time nonetheless the service was of course very good i thought it would be too stuffy for our tastes and that i'd feel out of place but this did not happen as a matter of fact after our server warmed up to us we had a great back-and-forth same goes for our backserver who we came to call the bread-pusher because the bread is incredibly addictingi had the tasting menu and other than the rabbit it was awesome i didn't like the rabbit not because of how it was prepared though i just don't like rabbit too cute and fuzzyour server brought us some great wine pairings that were not on the menu and included what we dubbed the "adult" framboise so delicious it was a cherry sparkling wine  and tasted amazing with chocolatethe whole night was opulence perfected i will probably never eat here again (oh except for that whole gift certificate thing) especially because it's closing but it was fantastic and really a wonderful place to take someone if you need to either impress them or if you're apologizing for something you really really screwed up
1,french restaurant in scottdale 55 thanks to aj and j we got a chance to dine and wine there last year it is a super nice french restaurant in phoenician resort my first fancy french dining experience :) all four of us had the tasting menu that evening with great ridge wine the tasting mene has small portion but amazing food as expected it took us ~4 hours to get done with the dinner it was the only drawback j could come up with i think that was perfectly fine for me since we are dining in a french restaurant just enjoy the process i would definitely go there again
1,wander around trying to find the perfect place to have dinner overwhelmed with options and unsure how to pick well we trekked to old montreal and perused probably ten menus of all different restaurants to inform our dinner location decision by the time we found jardin nelson we were hungry and getting punchy i looked to the back and saw the outdoor patio and large canvas coverings and said "oooohh let's go here" we were led to a quaint table at the back a jazz band playing lovely music the greenery and flowers hang all over the place and the whole atmosphere is warm and inviting our server was super nice friendly and courteousi got the leek soup special it was creamy savory a perfect soup i got the veggie crepe for dinner and gobbled every bit it was so delicious for dessert we had the cheesecake crepe and it was heaven you have to get this thing topped with graham crackers and strawberries totally decadentexquisite dining experience from top to bottom would return anytime and recommend to anyone
1,husband and i were big fans of this place not only for the great food service and jazz but for the experience as a whole we sat outside in the garden (after a 10 minute wait for a  late dinner on a friday night) and marveled at the design of the place the giant umbrella-like contraptions probably allow for outdoor seating when it rains and made you feel like you were sitting under giant flowers the south wall and the foliage definitely made us feel like we were in a garden the sounds of a jazz quartet wafting through a fresh summer night definitely capped a most romantic eveningnow the food: we started with the estivale salad (intricately prepared mixing refreshing fruit and vegetables together in perfect balance - one of the best salads we've ever had) and for our main course had the charcutiere pizza and the saddle of rabbit crepe the pizza was amazing - thin crust with the tastiest meats on there the crepe was also very tasty but difficult to isolate all ingredients within (no big deal)for dessert we shared the pouding chomeur and omg was it incredible it was very sweet (because of the high quality pure maple syrup) and the vanilla ice cream balanced that perfectlyone of the things i really liked seeing was that on the comment card there was a question for rating pricequality ratio indeed this place had an excellent pricequality ratio they could easily charge more for the setting for the jazz for the food but they don't very respectablefor a perfect romantic summer evening this is it highly recommended we would totally go back
1,be honest we stumbled across this place almost by accident and to top it off we almost missed the best part about the restaurant  there is a patio situated right onto place jacques cartier however there is an open section behind the restaurant where a jazz quartet was playing  the food was really good  my wife had a crepe my sister also had a crepe (not the same kind of course) while i enjoyed an "italian" pizza which i know as a margarita pizza  we absolutely loved the atmosphere and sitting outside on a hot and humid montreal evening drinking wine listening to live jazz  and eating great french food made this a real highlight of our trip
1,nelson is fantastic for several reasons the first of which is that it's one of the cheaper joints in vieux-montrealit was hot on the sun-baked cobblestone main path and i was aching to sit and enjoy a french style brunch and jn delivered beautifully we sat in the back garden and we were instantly cooled by the shade and breeze the architecture of the inner eaterie it's beautiful with lots of garden plants and stone walls well lit and your meal is accompanied by jazz music (sometimes live as when i went)the waitresses are cute and friendly and can obv accommodate if you only speak english the menu is somewhat sparse but what's on there is made with a delicate and professional touch; all of our food was top notch and delicious i had the house crepe a friend had the rabbit and another the scallopene we relaxed and enjoyed the meal and the scenery and heartily recommend the jardin nelson to both tourists and locals alike prices are btwn $15-25person
1,pretty place you're kind of outdoors but with a tent like ceiling with jazz playing i had a crepewhich was plaini thought they were known for their crepes but all crepes looked plain i should have gotten what my friend hadthe egg dishwhich looked like it was in a casserolemmmmmi was eying some guy who got a huge french onion soup it looked like twice the normal size should have gotten one get that french onion soup
1,of the most unique dining experiences i've ever had it's a building constructed around a courtyard with wind sail overhangs that protect you from the elements inside so basically your entirely outside and if it's raining it's quite the show rain funnels down the sails into large glass columns hard to explain but very cool food was above average but set amidst all of the tourist attraction area it's more than what you'd expect when i'm back in montreal i'm going back
1,visit to this wonderland of cheese was quite possibly the highlight of my friends' and my recent visit to montreal even if the food had been terrible the scenic brick courtyard with its lush flowering planters live jazz band and oversized umbrellas would've made the dining experience memorable but luckily the dinner was great toowe tried the brie pesto and pine nut fondue as an appetizer which was served with toasted baguette slices and a bunch of grapes and which met with enthusiastic reviews from our cheese-loving crowd a smorgasbord of the signature crepe dinners followed - we sampled the mushroom-filled forestiere the vegetable and goat cheese the apple-bacon and the duck at about $15-$20 a plate we didn't find the cost incongruous with the food quality for dessert we sampled the "pudding chomeur" a quebec favorite that features some sort of spongey sweet base soaked in maple syrup and served with a side of vanilla ice cream - also delicious though we were too stuffed to finish the modest portion even between the four of usthe service was equally pleasant; we arrived around 9:30pm on a saturday night and were seated within ten minutes our dry-witted french waiter was a delight suggesting that a hungry member of our party "start with one crepe and then if you're really still hungry i may bring you another" and later threatened to deny me dessert for not finishing my main course english menus are printed on the reverse of the french for visiting anglophones overall - great decor food ambiance and service we'll be returning if we're ever in old town montreal again
1,adore the jardin nelson not only is the location stunning being surrounded by historical buildings just off place jacques cartier in old montreal but the atmosphere in this indooroutdoor restaurant can't be beatthe largest part of the restaurant and most well known is their big terasse (can you call it that when it's more than 34 of the restaurant) with huge parasols in case it rains sit under the sun or the stars while eating perfectly cooked meal or dessert crepes while sipping on a glass of fine winejardin nelson is perfect for a romantic night out especially when the jazz band is playing
1,went to jardin nelson on a friday at lunch  there can be a bit of line but the wait wasn't too badthis place is worth the visit for the ambiance alone a beautiful courtyard patio with canopies and trees and flowers and a jazz combo played in the not so backgroundwe shared the nachos ($15) for starters and they were very yummy and cheesy  my father kept commenting on the cranberry salsa  my mother started with the french onion soup and said it was the best she had ever had i had the unbeetable salad and found it filling and delicious i also ordered a 16 oz pitcher of white sangria  it was great  so yummy on a warm afternoon and great to share with a friendmy 3-year-old was nicely welcomed and given crayons and a paper  she had the pancakes (other choices for kids were limited to pasta or pizza) a place i will return to
1,decor live jazz music and delicious brunch fare this is absolutely one of my favourite brunch spotsthis restaurant is the perfect marriage between outdoor and indoor dining the decor is simply stunning - the unusual giant umbrellas the potted plants and flowers and the exposed brick create a whimsical and romantic environmentto eat i had the bacon breakfast crepe it was heavenly the crepe batter is much thicker than the expected paper-thin variety but it definitely works it's still light and soft and the hint of sweetness works so well with the salty bacon and savoury cheese and eggs just writing this review makes my stomach growlif you're looking for a great brunch spot in old montreal definitely check this place out
1,that jazzother places do jazz once in a while but these folks do it all year 'round aw yea great venue and friendly bar staff don't know much about the food but their drinks and desserts are solid but really you come for the jazztips: check out the website for the latest performance information and singermusician biography
1,loved this intimate place it is small and upstairs writes upside down because it is actually in a basement :-) very stylish and great jazz not the kind so out of tune & u can't bear drinks are delicious here too and cheap i had the entertainer - a recommandation from a handsome waiter very well made for only $75 my friend had something colada which is also very tasty one note thought there is a 5 dollar per person charge to sit down
1,jazz club cozy atmosphere with traditional jazz club feel i listened to krakatoa and they were spectacular
1,pm - "gentlemen there's a $5 cover charge""i thought it was free after 11 pm""oh yeah but there's six minutes left if you want to not pay the cover charge you could just wait outside for a few minutes then come back in""sure thing sugar"fucking a canadians really are a polite people sweet and she didn't care that i called her "sugar"ah i do love the fact that i work in an office from the 1950sanywho this place is awesome damned if i can actually name any jazz musicians or songs but i do enjoy listening to it plus 2 of my friends were in our college's jazz band and aren't really the raging type so they were interested in this place when i mentioned that i found it on yelpit's a small intimate pub with candlelit tables and very comfortable seating we just wanted to unwind and have a few more drinkshmm fairly strong mixed drinks are in the 7-12 bucks range not badwaitress another gin and tonic pleaseyeah fuck it i'll try a raspberry lynchburg lemonade why notand so we end up closing out the place and shaking hands with every performer who played that night again damned if i can recall their names but we had a great time crowd was about split between a college-age crowd and some older people as it turned out most of these were performers or at least ended up playing some songsnot too busy on a tuesday so we got our drinks quickly and also got to you know actually hear the musicians playingthey also have food but we didn't order any they also have various teas on hand so if you really want to relaxexcellent place for a date or just a relaxing night out
1,is montreal's finest jazz venue and one of the city's local gems its a small and intimate a perfect spot for any date and a fun way to spend an evening sipping on drinks grabbing a bite and listening to some of the best live music in the area  joel giberovitch opened this neat little jazz joint nearly 20 years ago which has gained a notable amount of popularity especially in the last decade his inspirations from his past  trips to legendary new york jazz are an obvious influence in the makeup of his decor which include wooden panels brick walls a lengthy yet cozy bar and classy linens draping each table if that doesn't establish the mood i don't know what does seating is tight of course but group dining is very possible here; i would highly recommend reservationsthough it's been touted as a fun lunch spot i'm more of a fan during their showcase nights which happen every friday and saturday there is usually a cover charge before midnight which was about $5 last time i checked groups of 4 or more are almost guaranteed a wait but if you don't listen to jazz often then take it like a champ and wait it outif the music isn't worth it (but of course it is) then consider the food and the drinks much of the menu is distinctly american with quite few dishes named after notable states in the south the birth place of jazz another portion of the menu is tapas which is more bar food (nachos quesadillas fries etc) than they are classic spanish small plates i've enjoyed their food overall as i've had good results with their pappardelle verona their new orleans filet mignon and their array of tasty burgers try any of their martinis or get a wine to be paired with the foodthen of course there's the music live jazz doesn't have to be during montreal jazz festival it can be had here on a much more casual level the music has always taken precedence and has been a treat every time i could probably not even eat anything and just sit to enjoy the performances which vary from a wide range of local and visiting musiciansi think very highly of this place and hope it continues to do well i haven't gone to montreal as often lately and want upstairs to keep the drinks flowing and the music going if only i could write their name upside down (see pics for reference)
1,many years ago and enjoyed it i am glad to see they are still there
1,here years ago and couldn't believe this was in my own citysitting down having a drink listening to talent i felt like a tourist and loved it also the fries and garlic mayo is awesome for a late night snackso for a romantic jazzy date night visit upstairs which is actually downstairs
1,placethey have a packed calendar full of local jazz bands and plenty of them are the real deal doesn't matter what your age is or how you feel about jazz music you will enjoy the evening's performance because they're always top-notchthe room does tend to get very stuffy and warm though so allow yourself some time to get used to the difference in temperature inside (especially nowadays when the thermometer's beginning to dip) i can't complain about the food: lots of tasty tapas (the ceviche prosciutto and gambas are must-tries) a great scotch selection and of course local beers if you get there while an act has already started their set sit outside if it's not too cold you still get to enjoy the music and the food without having to pay for the cover (or suffering the heat)
1,place is listed in several places as one of the best jazz clubs in canada and specifically in montreal  since montreal has possibly one of the best jazz scenes in the world that's high praise  i can see whywhile the music may not always be jazz the club is a great venue  its small and intimate with good acoustics  make sure you check the calendar as the bands can be eclectic  and you may want to make reservations  finally expect a cover charge ($11 and well worth it)the doorman was great  there wasn't any more room for a show and instead of simply telling us to beat feet as many would he recommended a later show and reservations in the future  we came back for the later show and he seated us at the side bar  after the set he seated us (party of two) in a booth for the late set  while the house wasn't full for the late show it was still greatly appreciatedgreat staff great venue great music  i can't recommend it enough
1,this place recently the ambiance is nice and cozy the live jazz band was really good and the service was superb we thought that the one servicing us was either owner or manager of the place that's how much attention he paid to us won't even let us pour or own wine :"wine taste better when served by someone else"
1,an amazing facial here i have been there for a pedicure and massage in the past it's great
1,highly recommend this place nothing but a positive experience need the right person for your hair someone you can trust and make you feel like a new person go see rachel she is amazing so much talent she gave me the hair makeover of my dreams and i recommend her to anyone
1,have been going here for hair cuts and color for years wonderful stylists - very professional and well trained they also have other servicesfull spa nails pedicure would highly recommend this salon
1,always have such a wonderful experience at salon vivace in mt lebanon today i received an aroma facial by brittany and it was fabulous my skin looks and feels great and she knew exactly what my skin needed their product line is wonderful and mostly all-natural which was a relief as i am pregnant brittany was sure to make me feel comfortable throughout the entire facial and customized the products for my skin's needs i will definitely be back for another afternoon of spoiling :-)
1,really not sure why the other people who wrote reviews are such haters i have to admit that i'm not the kind of dude who ever thought that i would start coming to a place such as la pomponee to get an "overpriced" haircut let's put it this way i'm a cheap bastard when it comes to haircuts but i can guarantee that you will never find me in a supercuts again my entire experience blows every haircut i have ever had out of the water i love the fact that i showed up after scheduling an appointment the previous day and there was no waiting around the stylist name i regret can't remember from two days ago but i told her straight up "i'm giving you full latitude to do what you think is right for me" i was not disappointed with how nice of a job she did she asked the right questions and i could hold a good conversation with her to top off the experience i was offered a complimentary bottle of heineken that isn't happening at supercuts and it only cost about an extra $10 i would highly recommend this place for all men's haircuts
1,love la pomponnee this is the only place i go to get my eye brows waxed and i will only get them done by bonnie she is awesome i have also gotten a few facials and 1 couples massage here everyone i have encountered is always nice and helpful
1,been looking for a fun stylist in pittsburgh that "gets" my curly hair -- and doesn't charge a fortune -- for years after my first appointment today i'm ending my searchaaron p did a fantastic job on my cut and balanced out my texture and volume the rest of the staff was friendly and the space with bright and upbeat to second an earlier comment they didn't offer me a tour or brochure of their services as a first-time guest -- but i didn't mind asking for themi'll their other services and will report back but for now i highly recommend la pomponnee
1,spa had a blueberry facial - felt instantly hydrated which i really needed they have a ton of options and really helpful knowledgeable staff it's worth the investment
1,i have to say is that i've sold my soul to the follicle gods at modern  i've been struggling for the last couple of years to find my salon "home" and after my last two appointments with cj clark at modern in birkdale i'm finally home  i went in (scared to death) for a style-changing cut  i started with long hair (half-way down my back) and emerged with a sassy new shoulder-length bob  modern often gets bad press because of their rather expensive prices but service like this is worth every penny  the only downside to this salon is that they only accept gratuity via cash or check  for other debit card addicts out there you'll have to suck it up and go to an atm before your visit
1,parks is an amazing massage therapisti was visiting from out of town and needed a massage  i was staying at a hotel nearby and knew modern salon from when i lived in the area before  i called up and they got me in right away  i walked in filled out the paperwork and in walks my massage therapist  he brought me into the room and gave me my instructions and left  i shed my clothes and slipped under the covers of the warmed massage table david knocked and came in and began what i now refer to as one of the best massages i have ever had in my life  he used hot damp towels on my back hands and feet  it is incredibly difficult for me to "turn my brain off" - even during a massage  i actually fell asleep   ahhh what stress
1,of the best salons ever they take hair and skin very seriously toni t for haircuts jennifer martinez for color sodi for threading and candace or debbie nelms for waxing must see tiffany for a massage this little woman has great hands
1,my history of haircare is not a simple one  there have been many attempts by many haircare professionals to try to tame my mane and keep my 'do' in check a lot of 'accidental crew cut' incidents and uneven 'laughed at by everyone including my mom' moments  many have failed  few have been passable  lana from hearst tower modern has been the only one with a combination of skill and patience to really understand the method to the madness that is my "chia pet"-esque head    i have now been visiting her for over a year and she has made me look better each subsequent time  consistency talent great customer service hard to realistically put a price tag on that level of value (plus free neck trims between each haircut)  i can proudly say - people of charlotte with hair that can grow out straight for 5 inches before falling flat rejoice   there is an alternative to shaving it all off or applying half a bottle of 'la looks'  just because your head is lopsided does not mean you can't look sexay one other thing fuck greatclips  that is all
1,you work uptown this is a great location for you  i get my hair and eyebrows done here and have also have had several massages  the staff is really sweet - they always remember what wine i like  there is enough staff to fit your needs and price ranges  they do reminder calls which i love cause i make my appts months in advancethere is a central desk that triages all modern calls so if you are running late it is kind of annoying because you cant just call the location you are going to  but the desk will let them know right away so it has always worked outit is just odd that it is hard to get ahold of the your specific location  love you modern  i always leave feeling pampered and fabulous  :-d
1,was in town for a wedding this past weekend i forgot to pack my heavy duty equipment to style my hair and when i say heavy duty equipment i really mean it my hair is long thick and curly so i found modern salon just a few blocks away from my hotel when i first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blow-drying my hair would take a lifetime she scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist they are lucky to have her as a mentor i don't usually write reviews but after the experience i had at that salon i think it's worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon i did mention to nikki this is probably the first time i've ever had anyone "understand" my hair she didn't take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing i wish i could have taken her back home to dc but she suggested a really good stylist in this area :)
1,let the 80s logo scare you off i had a really great haircut here for really cheap - just $35 i made an appointment without asking about pricing because i was in desperate need of a haircut the stylist spent a long time talking to me about what i wanted how i style my hair how much time i spend and what products i use as she was cutting my hair she gave me lots of tips on styling in the end i came out with one of the best haircuts i ever hadadd in the wine excellent head massage and makeup touch-up she gave me at the end and it was a 5-star experiencebtw it's an aveda salon in case you are wondering
1,recently moved to charlotte and have been looking for a good aveda salon i googled locations near my office and found modern salon i was able to get an appointment the day of with a junior stylist i saw laura and she gave me an amazing hair cut for $36 (excluding tip) i have to admit i was nervous to see a junior stylist but i can honestly say she gave me one of the best hair cuts i've had in a long time i definitely recommend her
1,hooked i made a last minute appointment to get all over color and a partial highlight in an attempt to fix a seriously botched coloring  i showed a picture and explained what i wanted and laura and val worked their magic my hair look amazing and it came out way better than i ever expected  also they did it so that i don't have to touch anything up for 7-8 weeks  the staff is great and they are very attentive and accomodating  it can get pricey but it is worth every penny :)
1,place is awesome and gabby did a great job giving me the best haircut of my life  pay the extra few bucks to go here rather than get a sub par cut someplace else well worth it
1,first time visiting palestra i had an appointment with sharon i was looking for a place that specified with skin care i didn't want to go somewhere and spend a hundred dollars on someone rubbing and massaging products into my face for a hour i wanted to come out with some results to my skin problems sharon did everything i wanted in a facial plus more their business is skin and it started out with sharon's mother hannah and now sharon is in the business its a nice quaint place not as grand and opulent as the franchise spas but nice and cozy sharon explained a lot of things to me so i could understand what she was doing while she was doing it but not too talkative where i was unable to relax she started out with explaining her background and than moving onto my skin needs and what she recommends for my facial she took her time doing everything she was so thorough with her massages and extractions i loved it what i didn't expect and have never received anywhere else was a foot massage while my face was getting a peel and steam bath i usually get a hand or shoulder massage but never a foot massage she massaged each foot and put them into little warm booties i was in my little own world while she was working on my face i did not feel rushed i felt like she had all the time in the world to work on my face pore by pore i loved it and recommend it to anyone who needs skin care
1,have been going to palestra to see sharon for a long time the spa is extremely relaxing and welcoming sharon always does a excellent job i always look forward to my next appointment i  look and feel wonderful every time i leave they are the best
1,an esthetician that is good at both facials and full body massages is difficult  if you want a great experience at a great value book an appointment with melanie  i've had many massages and facials in my life  time and i would have to say she's my favorite  very in tuned with the body mind and soul  she worked on muscles i didn't know i had and my face looks so much healthier after seeing her
1,this place it is amazing the prices are pretty good and i only let melanie touch my face she is very educated and makes you feel very comfortable i normalyy get the express mini and i have gone there so many times they know me when i call i feel very comfortable here the atmosphere makes you feel very comforable and relaxed and the facials are amazing
1,usually prefer body wraps to massages but melanie made me forget wraps even exist she gave me such a wonderful hot stone massage and was extremely considerate of my preferences throughout - staying warm making the experience relaxing while still relieving tension and creating a calm peaceful environment she wasn't the least bit pushy and i left feeling more relaxed than i have in years all around it's everything i want in a day at the spa and i can't wait to go back
1,heart modern salonan amazing value - got a great haircut and a relaxing (didn't realize that was possible) eyebrow wax here yesterday only $65  lesley gave me the exact haircut i was looking for all while fixing the goofy layers i was growing out from my last busted haircut   the service was fantastic as long as i am in charlotte this is the only place i will go  tip - they do not let you put tip on the credit card so make sure you have cash with you
1,really like modern salon  my 1st time going i had made an apt with myra for a cut and color  i didn't know anything about her and i was nervous because my hair is kind of my "thing"  and if you get a bad haircut you have to wait to make it betterwell turns out myra was great a really sweet girl and she knows what she is doing  that first time there i was coloring my hair dark brown and i discussed with her what would i have to do to get back to my natural dirty blonde color when i got sick of being a brunette  she explained what we would need to do and a little over a year later we started on the process to bring it back to blonde  it was definitely cheaper to just get cut and color then the highlights and cut but she does such a good job and i always get a lot of compliments  and i can let it go for longer in between touch ups  also of note my first time here the receptionist didn't let myra know i had checked in and so there was a bit of a misunderstanding and i was left to sit for a while  i approached the desk again after waiting 20 minutes and told them i had a flight to catch in 3 hours would we be able to start soon if not i had to leavewell myra was so apologetic and she felt awful that they kept me waiting  i did get out of there a bit later than i would have liked and i did find myself running to get into the airport but i did make my flight  but the best thing was i got a gift certificate in the mail soon after for either a free massage pedicure or facial with any other service i had  i thought that was a really nice touch and i used it for a pedicure after a haircut on another visit
1,nice place mohsen knows how to cut my hair - which not an easy job comparable to the high end places my wife and would go to in la and santa barbara great to have this level of skill in charlotte
1,you have hair get your booty to modern one of the worst things about moving is having to find a new stylist before i moved to charlotte i had my stylist do an all-over color to bring me back to my original hair color and wipe out my years of highlights so i didn't have to find someone right away after moving for upkeep after a year and a half i finally decided to brave the daunting task of finding a new salon so i could be back to my blonde alter ego girls in my office had been recommending modern for months but i decided to take my chances elsewhere bad choice after 3 sub-par highlights i looked like a tiger (in a bad orange and streaky kind of way) and gave in to their insistence that i try modern man do i feel silly that i wasted so much time and money at other salons sandy a stylist at modern was not only one of the nicest people i've ever met but she did an outstanding job on my hair she understood exactly what i relayed to her and went above and beyond in doing a deep conditioning treatment and explaining what we could do next time to make my hair look even better sandy is a true professional and really listened to what i was saying about how my hair reacts to different things and they way i like it to look (unlike the other places i had gone hence the tiger-head) after a wonderful head massage during the deep conditioning treatment and a fantastic blow-out i was on my way to face the world looking 100% better than when i walked in i would recommend sandy's services to anyone who wants to look fabulous
1,been getting my haircut here once a month for the past 10 months i'm very happy prior to coming here i went to salon cielo in the mall and occasionally would go to barbershops depending on what style i was going for i love the atmosphere in there and the staff is super friendly megan is the stylist that i regularly go to i definitely recommend her for haircuts she's great i thought that i'd have a hard time finding a great stylist and a great place to get haircuts but that's just not the case a+
1,started going to modern in june when i moved to charlotte from the dc area  my family owns an amazing salon in the dc area so i have very high standards when receiving any salon services  i've also never gone anywhere else for a haircut so i was a little nervous going somewhere newwhen i called to make my first appt the receptionist was very nice  she asked about  my budget and what i was looking for  she also explained their different levels of stylists that i had to choose fromthe salon is clean bright and smells great (thanks to aveda products)  my stylist siobhan is so nice and always does an amazing job  the front desk staff have always been nice as well
1,came here following a student on trial basis it's kind a small place but very calminghavnt figured out why yet  you feel spoiled here i only get my hair done here but planning to use other services soon i noticed that other clients as well get great personal services here it's nice to see men come here as well
1,gives the best massages - deep tissue  she is hard to get an appointment with because she is so good  but it is definitely worth the effort to get in  if i could afford it i would get a massage from tracy every week
1,reid is an awesome stylist  she does such a great job with my color and is the "brow-whisperer"
1,been going to mcv salon for more than a year always excellent service corina is friendly and energetic  i always get a fantastic haircut  very well put together shop
1,admit i have very high expectations when it comes to service and this place was amazing the stylist definitely took the time to listen to my concerns regarding my hair gave me a oil head massage before shampooing my hair a hand massage while my hair was conditioning and an amazing cut all for the low price of $33 i already have plans to make it back thank you for being so wonderful
1,experience at mcv salon was excellent staff is professional shop is cute and overall great service for a reasonable price
1,is an este lauder salon actually it is an aveda salon (same thing)  i love aveda it's like a cult that i am in aveda onlythere's only 3 beauty products i let touch my skin and hair este lauder moisturizer mac studio finish concealer and aveda shampoo and conditioner get the point i think i should be in charge of the este lauder portfolio or a brand ambassador or something so enough about the aveda products the stylists at mcv really do wonders since moving to wi i made myself home at mcv and have a regular hairdresser who makes my life easier and less stressful every four weeks for a trim the convenience and little text message alerts and reminders that mcv send to my phone to remind me of my appointment are helpful i have a tendency to forget or not write appointments down oh and kirsten does an amazing job such talent  highly recommend
1,have been going here for about a year and love it my stylist listens to what i want and i always leave feeling great the massages while washing hair are so relaxing they always offer tea and water and during the winter -warm cider which was deliciousthe only thing i don't like is that you can't put a tip on your card half the time i forget and have to run and get cash and go back
1,basically an upbeat positive personbut some days i'm not my normal corky self i arrived at perry monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in san franciscobut in phoenix for an hour please i mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time i should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking she then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form i went to the bathroom which featured a delightful scented candle and then sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair a surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first the massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her marina cut my hair and although she was not much of a talker was upbeat and gave me a great cut i've been looking for a great place in phoenix and found it no one will ever compare to my beloved cid at barbarella in san francisco but i do have a new favorite salon locally in the valley of the sun
1,has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years  whenever i walk out of there i cannot believe how my hair looks and i oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut  perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me what more can i askthe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once i've fallen asleep  once a couple years ago in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work they asked if i wanted anything to drink  i said only if you have vodka  next thing i know a clear drink on ice shows upand tasted suspiciously like vodka  no that's customer service
1,absolutely love perry monge salon  i have been going there since 2004 and it has never disappointed  the entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home  marina is amazing with hairi only wish she could style my hair every morning  the extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut  i spend 75% of my time in dallas and 25% of my time in phoenix but insist on only having my hair cut at perry monge
1,is no doubting that i am an aveda girl being in phoenix and having plenty of aveda salons around you would think i'd be beauty-heaven but when i left cleveland i was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so i scheduled my hair appointments around when i'd be flying home well as one could image that become very expensive so i finally decided to take a chance with perry monage downtown i'm so glad i did from the moment i walked in to the stylist they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color too there was a little up-selling me with products which i wasn't use to and i must admit i did cave but i mean aveda hello can we say amazingi'm still in love with aveda and i'm now in love with perry monage
1,hair cut in town clean facility friendly staff and they are always very welcoming definately recommend getting your hair cut hereactually i recommend getting them all cut - ha (hair cut humor is just awful) if you are in to hair products they have a great selection on aveda stuff
1,love this place the customer service is second to none the front desk staff is always friendly and helpful i have a great hairstylist and the other services i have received have been wonderful even when i am there just on my lunch break to pick up a few things i am always offered something to drink products are recommended but there is no pressure to make any purchases it's comfortable clean and the staff is always on time yay for perry monge
1,was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in colorado i went to my aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from perry monge marie luce ( sp) gave me a coupon for 2000 off so i decided to give it a tryomg from the moment i walked in i felt like royalty i think i was getting the first timeservice but not only did i get one of the best haircuts a styling a 5 minute back massage a very thorough hand massage a facial ( yep)eyebrow waxing a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino i wound up buying 3 products but i always buy something aveda when i go so it wasn't a hard selli love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 12200 what i had a 2000 off coupon but stillit was brilliant marketing i have found a new stylist and i will be faithful in getting a facial each time i go because it's so worth it i highly recommend marie luce she is amazing
1,ochoa amazing 2 months later and i'm still getting compliments on the cut and how healthy it looks i've been going there for about 4-5 years and will continue to do somarina will listen to you tell her what you want and she will give you ideas and suggestions she won't push anything including products though the products she recommends are always topnotch she won't make you feel like you have to purchase anything the staff is always very cheerful and happy to assist you with any questions tell marina maria sent you :)
1,at 5:15pm  they closed at 5:30 but told me to come by  i wish i knew the name of the woman who washed cut and styled my hair as well as plied me with champagne and did my makeup  i am not from phoenix but if i was i would never go anywher else
1,have been going to the perry monge salon for about 14 years  i love this place  if you are latina have curly hair and cannot find anyone to cut your hair andor style it because of the curl this is your place  saturdays are busy but i try to avoid them  i am lucky i work downtown so i am able to make an appt right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of saturdays  being a client for so long i have tried their spa waxing services and of course hair services and and happy with everything  i have even recommended this salon to many friends and family all of whom are still loyal clients  an added bonus my husband and i joined the aveda pure privilege program it took us approx 4 years of saving our points but in 2011 we had a 6 night stay in jamaica  it was absolutely wonderful  we stayed at the caves in negril complete with complimentary massages  since then we have saved another 44000 points and are looking forward to booking our 3 night stay in antigua next year when we reach 50000 points
1,had the absolute best pedicure of my life today from raisa  my feet were in sad shape after months of neglect and she worked on them for an hour and a half and turned them into gorgeous soft smooth perfectly polished feet i've been happy with pedicures at the spa at camelback inn and the spa at the royal palms  but  the pedicure i got today was nothing short of a miracle  i would recommend raisa's signature pedicure to anyone and plan to go back in a few weeks  it was an indulgence but it was completely worth it
1,is wonderful if you need a brazilian wax i am moving to the phoenix area in about 6 months but was in town over the holidays and decided to try this elizabeth arden location (since i go to another one where i currently live for brazilians) i am sooo glad i did because now i know where i can get an awesome wax once i move jodena was so nice and got it all i can't wait to go back
1,service  just ordered a manipedi treatment from them over the phone for my mother-in-law  this is an annual treat for her on mother's day and she absolutely loves it  this salon is well organized and professional  and my mother-in-law raves about the quality and service for months
1,love this place  i live out of state and recently called elizabeth arden for a gift certificate for my mother-in-law for mother's day  i have done this annually for her for several years and she had always loved the service  i must admit that i was going to go to a less expensive place this yearcut backs and the economy  after reading reviews online i selected a nail spa close by  the service was really horrible on the phone  i can only imagine what it would have been like in person  i ended up not purchasing a gift certificate from them and instead coming back to elizabeth arden again  yes i spent twice as much for her mother's day presentbut i would rather pay double verses deal with poor service and questionable product  when my mother-in-law comes here she is always happy and feels pampered on her special day  and they really do gift certificates well  i will not shop around again
1,i can say is i got my wife a massage package for christmas last year and she hasn't stopped talking about it she was glowing for weeks the staff was awesome about helping me pick out a package in my price range without trying to upsell me i would highly recommend giving a package as a gift my wife loved it
1,have only had manipedi's at the red door but they are the best i've ever had anywhere i don't have artificial nails and i've always had problems with the polish on my nails chipping - like the very next day  i don't know what gina does but the polish on my fingernails lasts a full week and then they don't chip they merely wear at the tips and the toe polish lasts weeks & weeks the warm 'bucky' on the shoulders is an added bonus as are the complimentary neckshoulder massages (when the masseuse has time)
1,here for az spa week and it was a great experience i got a $50 stress melting treatment (normally $230)john was my treatment specialist and was super personable and sweet the changing room is a bit smalltight if there are multiple gals changing at the same time but otherwise the whole spa is cleani would go here more often if i could afford it
1,have been coming to the elizabeth arden red door spa since 2001  david is a wonderful colorist and frank cuts and styles my hair better than anyone i have had in my life  i am asian and my hair is not easy to cut so kudos to frank and all the other stylists that have filled in in the past when i didn't call ahead to book an appt  i have never had a bad hair day since 2001in the past year i have seen jon for therapeutic deep tissue massage  because of my work a good massage is not just a luxury; it is a necessity  i take my out-of-town girlfriends to the phoenician to chill-out but i take my back and shoulder issues to jon  he is the best therapeutic massage therapist i have experienced and i am so glad he is at the spa now selfishly i am hoping he doesn't get too many requests after this post to still have time to fit me in
1,a package treatment deal for my friend about 2 months ago she went today and called me back she was so happy she said everybody was super nice very friendly and relaxing atmosphere she said they offered like a small upgrade i am real happy to hear that she had such a wonderful day it was a gift for her and red door spa came thru in making her feel special and appreciatedi want to say thank you to all the people that worked there on april 14
1,mani pedi ever a little pricey but worth it miranda is excellent
1,service i used them for a classic car restoration 5 years ago and all my parts i sent to powder coating plus are still in great shape  their attention to detail and service are great  adam was very easy to work with
1,coating plus is one of the best vendors we have  they get our product in right away and we never have any issues everything always comes out looking amazing their quality control is impeccable  they are great to work with we wouldn't take our stuff anywhere else we only take it to the best and they are definitely the best thank you guys for all your hard work we love you at all metal maintenance stands
1,and his team are clearly professional  i've had them do some tough jobs for me and they have come out perfect every time  the prices are very competitive and probably the best in town  best not just in price but in quality and customer service
1,to find a new powder coater since my usual place went out of business recently  after a lot of checking a round i ended up here  glad i did great work fair price & quick turn around
1,had to get two large pieces coated in less than a week my normal powder coater was backed up for 3 weeks i called vyne after a recommendation from another shop these guys did a fantastic job; on time and on budget i'll defiinitely hit them up again
1,guys do a great job on time we use them constantly for our in house manufactured products and they are consistant in color and quality every time
1, what an amazing job they did   i had an old bistro set that looked so bad and they made it look brand new   so impressed   very nice owner and employees  will use them again
1,was so nice and they are great people thanks again for turning my old metal clamshell chairs into something beautiful
1,had a few items done one small and one large both came out better than i could think good turn around and great prices
1,have had quite a few items powder coated for my car from snail motorsports and have had nothing but a great experience and tons of complements from the work that was performed at this shop pricing was every bit of what i paid for quality and professional work and  i definitely recommend this shop to anyone and everyone who asks where a good place is to get this type of work done :)
1,investing into higher end aftermarket car parts for my vehicle i found a need (or want) for ceramic coating snail motorsports came recommended to me from various friends colleagues and business partners being that the items i purchased were not a small investment i decided to take the recommendations and bring my business to snail9 months later i still continue to bring all of my ceramic coating needs to snail motorsports every order i've placed with snail small or large (cost not only size) has been consistently of the utmost quality as someone who chooses to invest his hard earned money on an item it gives me relief to know snail will always provide quality service care and most of all great customer serviceto speak briefly about comparison i've since had experience with other local coating shops although the quality and care of the work done elsewhere was sufficient i will continue to use snail's services when i need quality work done correctly the first time thanks snail keep up the great work
1,have gone with snail motorsports for so many things since juan started in his garage doing small jobs  he has powder coated an antique medicine cabinet several sets of wheels several parts for my jeep media blasted a ton of our chairs for our businessthat ton equals out to around 300  when he tells you when he will have your items ready he is right there with it when he promises  you can find him in his shop way into the late hoursjust to get your item completed  you will never find anyone more type a about his finished product than juan  we have never been disappointed in any item or any quote we have received  he does all of his own media blasting and powder coatinghe doesn't farm them out to other contractors  he service is top notch and i would recommend snail motorsports to everyone  thank you juan and the snail motorsports team
1,have huge trust issues when it comes to my car at first i was really scared because i was getting $2k rims (advan tciii) and almost $3k worth of parts under the hood juan exceeded my expectations they came out perfect with the amount of work time and effort he put into them i'm surprised he didn't charge me more he gave me an awesome deal a few months later i brought a set of cheaper wheels (used set of enkei rpf1) and a few suspension parts to get coated and the work was just as phenomenal juan treated $800 worth of parts just as he would $5k worth of parts i wouldn't trust anyone else with powder coating my car parts i will always support quality work and that is why i will always be a customer of juan and snail motorsports
1,snail do a scooter frame for me i was trying to save money and go with a cheaper option but they hooked it up with an awesome pearl multistage after that had me do a set of wheels that came out perfect mounted and balanced as well powder coat isn't cheap but they were half as much as any other quotes i got i send everybody i know there
1,had all my engine caps and strut tower brace done here the strut tower brace matches the car with with race stripes perfectly aligned with the oitside paint very professional and great pricing
1,took in all 5 wheels for my 1970 vw beetle for powder coating  they were looking pretty shabby after over 40 years of faithful service  this vw was my first car and i'm only the second owner (bought in '86)  it's very special to me and i wouldn't trust any part of it to just anyonemy first contact with snail motorsports was via email and juan answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly  very clear on pricing and time to completion  i took the wheels in selected my color and went home to wait  i was pleasantly surprised to receive a link to photos of my wheels after media blasting and at completion  the work was done on-time and the whole process was very professional  i couldn't be happier now 2 years later they look as good as the day i picked them upyou can't go wrong with snail motorsports for powdercoating
1,my enkie rpf1s done a nice gold color they were nice enough to install toms and also mount and balance the tires for free the finish looks awesome and i get a lot of compliments on my 350z great customer service
1,it done and get it done once powder-coating at its best or use the other guys ((not))
1,am a huge fan of sushi three they live within walking distance of my home so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind admittedly the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time but when i do come here i enjoy every bite occasionally i also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals but really i prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itselfspeaking of: the place itself is very quiet which i actually like; i can just sit talk with a friend or read a book and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace this is a big deal for me because the other places i know of where i can get sushi are loud busy and quite frankly a little limiting options-wise compared to sushi three's menu if i want sushi i either come here or i get a small pack at giant eagle that's how much i hate the other sushi places i've visited in pittsburgh if i'm going to pay as much as i do for my fish i want to be in a place i can sit and actually enjoy my foodby the way sushi three does serve things other than sushi so people looking for some japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something there's some really delicious beef chicken and pork dishes but of course a place with the word "sushi" in its name is going to specialize in sushi and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here the orders come in various styles and sizes as well so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves the combos all come with soup and salad which are also very yummyi at this point have developed a routine order: a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all i need here sure i'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me but the truth is that sushi three makes such enormous orders that i can't eat more than that without feeling a bit sick but hey at least you get your money's worth i say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan
1,little neighborhood place food is good service is great  try the tofu salad appetizer
1,go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and it's one of my favorite places the resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing service is quick and friendly the lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that i never get bored with the choices their tempura is the best i've ever had and the rest of their food is just as amazing their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight even thinking about it has set me drooling
1,sushi watched it be prepared in front of us and the entire place is super clean friendly staff highly recommend stopping here
1,place has restored my faith in delivery sushi for the longest time i could only eat it fresh (not delivery) but this is the second place ever i've found that i thoroughly enjoyed the sashimi appetizer takosu flower roll and a spicy tuna roll with no asparagus of the two places ever this is my new number one the spicy tuna roll and and sashimi app were my favorites the hubby got yellowtail fish jowl and fried rice also very good delivery was on point and even the call to put in the order was smooth and easy
1,have long wanted to eat teppanyaki style food and been thinking of going to benihana for a longest time but after reading reviews on yelp for the one in sunnyvale ca i was quite apprehensivei had also heard good things about benihana in pittsburgh from my brother in law and so decided to go there whenever i goto pittsburghso finally we went there after new years and had a blast we had to wait at the bar even after making reservation but thats ok at the table we were not rushed at all the food was tasty and the chef was funny and interesting not to mention very entertaining and friendly bartender  - martyoverall it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had
1,like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups they also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month  i would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat but this is a great place to go for a special occasion
1,atmosphere was fun our chef was very nice and entertaining the filet was excellent  their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste  over all it was a great time i will definitely go back
1,swore that kobe japanese steakhouse in orlando was the best one i had ever been to but i think they may have some competition with this onemy boyfriend and i tried them out on labor day just get something different from what we normally do he had been some years back before and this was my first time getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (i don't know is that considered a mountain or is it a hill being from the south everything that makes me lift my legsfeet higher is a mountain) it was rather empty as it was only like 1130am but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke  maybe) the interior is ridiculously awesome especially the raised barour chef walks up and it's a white man which was a definite first for me at a japanese steakhouse and he seemed out of it during the course of the meal he did inform us that he was hungover  it's labor day what're gonna do it didn't bother me too much but i think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol he told some good albeit corny jokes did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertainingthe food: oh man was it yummy i got the soba noodles and beef julienne the noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that i couldn't describe but they were the best soba noodles i have ever had the beef julienne was also super delicious the sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce but it didn't taste like it at all to me which was fine with me because i'm not a big teriyaki fan after eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece the bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere sure japanese steakhouses are pricey but this is one of the few i've been to that is more than worth it
1,sushi during happy hour is great the wife and i eat well for $20  that's drinking pop though  don't judge
1,is my favorite place to eat the shrimp fried rice steak sauces and just everything are incredible the prices can be a bit high but it is worth it
1,is by far our favorite steak and seafood place in the area the food is so fresh the chefs are great the wait staff is excellent  if you're looking for shrimp flying and loud chefs singing obnoxious songs then this is not for you if you want a friendly  atmosphere and delicious food then this is your place the sushi is fresh and tasty the quality of food is obviously there
1,this place great sushi and have great sushi specials at lunch and hh bartenders are the best also marty is the man
1,a wonderful experience at benihana with the family last night  we love hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis  benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area so we had not been for a while  we arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming  they would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything  after our party arrived we were seated and our chef came out he was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing  the best part was how accommodating the staff was  one member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredientswe had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant  after a few "laps" of the restaurant without us asking the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter very happy  everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than i had remembered  benihana has a lot of competition from saga nakama and others but after our most recent visit benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff  we visited saga shortly after going to benihana and just kept commenting on how much better benihaha was
1,been coming here regularly for almost 30 years basically since i was born starting back when it was samurai some of the older waitresses (hide) are like family at this point so i may be a bit bias the food is always good the servers are friendly and the chefs are entertaining without being obnoxious like a lot of other hibachi places i'm not big on sushi but what i've had is good they have a fantastic selection of wines beers and sake i'll probably be coming here for another 30 years
1,been in pittsburgh for a long time and if you read through my reviews you'll see that i love eating in pittsburgh i'm from nyc so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy i just really think that pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic and tasty foods i am a serious advocate of dining in pittsburgh and i take pride in knowing the good places to eat there those are my self-proclaimed credentials so take this to heart: andy's sushi bar (located in wholey's) is probably the 1 place to get sushirolls in pittsburgh now a few caveats: it is not a restaurant it is a stand inside wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders only you will not get a dining experience so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner you are not in luck this sushi stand is only open for lunch and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday you could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the timeday you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders he's fast but his line can get long take it for what it is: andy uses fresh and tasty fish he cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls he will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients he does have a limited selection of sushisashimi platters he has a good spider roll and after going a few times definitely ask for the "chef's special" -- he just loads up a roll for you you won't be disappointedand as for prices it's the best bang for your buck for sushi what more could you ask for
1,love  andy and he loves me i used to come here every sunday after church and order his special not on the menu rolls those are awesome  they are really fresh and flavorful
1,sushi bar is a convenient little stand set up inside wholly's in the strip district of pittsburgh it's not a dine in type of place but it is the best sushi i've ever had wholly's sells fresh fish and other meats so a very convenient place for a sushi bar my personal favorite of andy's is the philadelphia roll - without hot sauce i used to work in the strip and would often walk down to wholly's just to get sushi and talk to andy
1,would give andy 6 stars if possible due to:1 amaaaaaaazing sushi2 hilarious conversation3 fresh fresh fresh ingredients4 reasonable prices for the quality of food (which is stellar)5 andy's daily specials & inventive use of random sushi components (like mango & mint)6 free samples while you wait in lineandy is the best -- hands-down
1,andy how i miss your little swagger and sass i know this is a difficult one to rate since he runs a stand within another establishment (wholeys) but i am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing sushi he makes (right in front of you) and his stellar personality i have never met a person with blood flowing in their veins that didn't get a total kick out of andywhen i worked in the strip i ate here almost daily after only two visits he remembered exactly what i ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me: spicy yellowtail with avocado or just yellowtail with avocado maybe some cucumber have i mentioned that i am obsessed with yellowtail ahhhh the buttery-ness the texture the slight taste of the seaoh wait this isn't a review on a singular fish i got a little carried away (even though andy serves up some damn fine yt) sometimes he gets creative and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait he once came up with a maki roll made of salmon basil cucumber and mangobrilliantwholeys is such a fantastic people watching spot anyway and it's always amusing to see random people of all agesgenderssizes walk in and yell "andy"
1,has the best sushi his special sauce is what makes his sushi the best
1,pittsburgh is not a sushi mecca and never will be but andy has fair prices fresh fish and is easily the most charismatic sushi chef in the city cool environment and great sushi what more do you need is penn fish better maybe but not as entertaining
1,much as a sushi fan as i am i going to stick my neck out and say this is the best sushi in pittsburgh  here is my reasoningandy is not just a funny guy but is very generous  go when it's not busy and be prepared to be handed big chunks of raw fish with his different sauces  talk to him and get ready for sushi rolls bursting with fresh fish  next the place is in wholey fish market wholey gets fresh fish daily so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in pittsburghfinally the price load up on andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city  try andy's roll and the eel sashimigo see andy for some great sushi and sashimi
1,swear andy remembers every customer he ever had  i only get to visit him a couple times a year but he always asks how my family is and tells me to say hello to them for him  he always gives me a snack while i am in line as well  i place pretty big orders and leave a generous tip but he is just so kind and friendly  and i think his sushi is the best in the city even though the long line can be prohibitive
1,is super entertaining and serves up the best sushi in the burg  don't miss
1,tell the truth i have never had sushi here but the korean bbq buffet (upstairs) is wonderful  lots of different meats and vegetables that you bring to your table and cook there  the pork is great there is beef shrimp fish scallops maybe  i forget it all but there is a large variety  and the experience is really fun if you have never tried it before  at first we were a little worried that we might not cook the meat enough since they pretty much turn the stove at your table on and leave you to your own devices with little guidance but we haven't had any problems  it is not very hard to do  i love going here and eating a ton of delicious korean bbq  for $19 a person it is a great deal
1,is the first and only korean bbq i have ever visited  that said i can't wait to bring my whole family here at the end of the month for my birthday  i had so much fun filling my plate with marinated treats and cooking them on my table  it was a really amazing and unique  dining experienceif this place sucks compared to the average korean bbq i can't wait to try an outstanding one but for now in pittsburgh i don't know of anywhere else like it  and i'm in love
1,didn't exist when i used to go here back in the cmu days but it is still my favorite soon du bu (tofu stew) place - we just loved it  we never ate sushi here always the korean food  the hae mul pah jun is yummy the dol sol bibimbap is good but the soon du bu jige is the best  it's run by koreans hello  we were lucky to have this place in pittsburgh - it's not like there was a lot to choose from  but even now i rarely encounter a place (in the bay area) that has the same quality of tofu stew - and we have a "k-town" here
1,kim restaurant was awesome the food and service were top notch if you are in pittsburgh and are looking for great food stop here  a++++ try the korean short ribs
1,have been going to sushi kim for about 15 years while some of the more harder to find items are not on the menu (abalone anago otoro) i have never been disappointed with the food or service there really good korean food and very fresh sushi like i said i have been going for 15 years and mr and mrs kim never disappoint us
1,place is cute i adored their sushi as did the hot spicy beefveggie soup i had with kim chee (i can't remember the names of everything) great service too
1,here last night and it was absolutely the best meal i have had at sushi kim wife got the usual pork bulgogi and i got standar dol sut bi-bim-bap it was unbelievably good it wasn't because i was really hungry it was perfect every single bit of both meals was perfectly proportioned and seasoned and the side dishes were great except i really missed not having sweet potato and little omelet ban chan i will cut out dosani and korean kitchen as long as sushi kim keeps this up
1,sushi seaweed salad and beef bulgogi this place this place is five stars  some of the best sushi in the burgh
1,some of there sushi to start and then had one of their hot pots good sushi the pork hot pot was awesome love all the condiments
1,this place real authentic korean dishes i just moved to pittsburgh and their aren't really a lot of good asian styles food around went into sushi kim thinking i would only order sushi but my friend told me to order from their main menu the short ribs are to die for plus they have homemade kimchi which was very tasteful i came to this place about 5-7 times since i moved here love the korean bbq great service overall prices are a bit to high but is worth every penny deff coming back
1,righty i have eaten sushi in boston nyc portland me phily chicago san diego to name a few this place is the best ever and i have never been disappointed located in mt lebanon a cool little suburb of pittsburgh this resturant does not mess around the owner pays top dollar for all of his seafood and the chefs there are top notch in the back of the resturant is a japanese kitchen where you can order then watch 1 woman cook your food great spot for a date and best sushi this side of the missisip
1,tokyo is the restaurant where i first experienced sushi so it will always have a spot in my heart  however after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi i still believe little tokyo is one of the best  for one i have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in ohio and they are one of my favorites  little tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent  my favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu though the others are good as well  the atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-homecoming dinner  the service is attentive providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner  they will validate your garage parking for one hour and the mints in a jar at the cash register are deliciousi would highly recommend little tokyo especially over sushi two (or three i never can remember) on beverly road
1,is by far the best sushi in pittsburgh    the food is all amazing very fresh and authentic  and i still compare most places i have been to little tokyo  other than that i don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself  what you wont find here:  a trendy atmosphere like nakama ( i picked nakama because it is also so popular in pgh) but the sushi more than makes up for it
1,little tokyo  i haven't been here in years but this is the place that i got introduced to sushi  i still remember hesitantly slurping down my first salmon roll thinking raw fish must be the most awful thing in the world and well kinda loving it  the owners are good friends of my family from back when we lived in pittsburgh  i remember when they were first starting out--my dad helped design and build the sushi counter and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms  one time i had an epic wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son  on many a weekend as a kid i would go and stuff my face with all the sushi i could eat  i know for a fact they use the freshest fish i may be biased but i think my early experiences with massive-sushi-overload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob i am today  oh yeah and they have fried ice cream
1,sushi bar the staff and owner are extremely attentive great presentation decent price too and i got to sit next to mario lemeuix at lunch a couple weeks ago
1,tried sushi at all of pittsburgh's sushi offerings and none of them can touch little tokyo every city has a "best sushi place" and this is pittsburgh's hands down i've enjoyed over 20 meals at little tokyo and never once have i experienced bad sushi or bad service
1,sushi nigiri sushi here is a must-try
1,sushi place for pittsburgh - best i've found yet  (please don't expect west coast sushi - i did qualify my statement by saying "for pittsburgh"  i usually have to do this for pittsburgh restaurants)  sushi was a little loosely prepared but the fish seemed very fresh and the presentation was nice  the service was excellent too  our waitress was very friendly fast and helpful
1,love love this place  the sushi at this place is what i use as a basis to compare other sushi  i had my first taste of sushi at lil toks which is why it has become my benchmark  now i will say that i have had better sushi at a few places (umi in shadyside  pa and coast in chicago) but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality  those other places that i mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion  so whenever i'm in the mood for some sushi i come to this placei should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice creamevereven better than chi chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember)  people it's seriously that good
1,little tokyo dedicated customers keep the place full all week long and on the weekends if cleanliness is important to you this is the restaurant you want you could safely eat off the floors staff is friendly but unobtrusive a definite favorite
1,get what you pay for i've never been even slightly disappointed i've been coming here with a good friend for a few years and it's a must every time i come back to town for a visit on our most recent visit i had the sushi platter entree it comes with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle the salmon nigiri is incredible eat it slowly  savor it  i'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before i head back to arizona also their desserts are exquisite  the dessert menu changes but again i've never even come close to feeling disappointed  i don't care much for sweets but the dessert here is so good that i order something every time  ps don't wear a short skirt in case you get seated at a tatami table
1,ate one of the top 2 meals of my life in this restaurantit was the first time i had heard of "omkase" (or chef's choice of many small courses) and despite the hefty pricetag i was celebrating and opted to try itoh my god   an absolute slamdunk  i can't imagine going here and not getting that unbelivable sampler  my mouth is watering as i type
1,believe i've found my new favorite restaurant after being rather dissapointed with chaya last night i decided to go to umi tonightthe staff was friendly and service perfect there servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the mealbeggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: i was very happy with this dressing just about perfectnext the miso soup: i'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup but this was probably the best preparation i've had i could have gone for another bowl for my entree i chose the dinner sushi assortment this was by far the best sushi i've ever tasted as cliche as it may sound every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good  the accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least they merely enhance the flavor of the fish  the pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth  this is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places i rather enjoyed the size but just wanted to make note of it the tuna roll was also very tasty i did not sample any other rolls tonight but i'm sure i will be back to do somy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki  the dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen  again this was probably the best preperation of the dish i've ever tasted the serving size was perfect about 5oz of very tender breast meat with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice  more than enough to satiate without the need for a nap afterwards i didn't sample the desserts tonight but i've seen others rave about them i will definitely be back as often as i can i don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in pittsburgh
1,to this place with my friends everything we had was amazing the appetizers were delicious this is what i ordered:1 miso soup: was awesome very flavorful my only complaint is there wasn't enough wakame for my likening but over all it was awesome 1 black cod with miso: this fish was cooked perfectly and literally melted in the mouth the flavor was mild and perfect 2 tuna tataki: this was slices of ahi tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside it was to die for 3 shrimp and asparagus maki roll: probably not a great choice to begin with this was okay nothing to rave about 4 fuji maki roll: this had crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside it was delicious 5 my friend had the assorted sashimi the serving was huge so i got to try some of his stuff the white tuna was delicious as was the salmon
1,sushi for serious sushi eaters  the omakase is expensive but definitely the way to go quite the adventure  the sauces the chef puts on the sushisashimi is what makes the differencethe black cod dish is unbelievable
1,who says that there's no good sushi in pittsburgh (and i've heard you say it folks right here on yelp) hasn't been to umi yet i'd been mostly satisfied sushi-wise by quality if standard places like little tokyo in the south side and chaya in squirrel hill before i went to umi with my roommate last saturday the first major difference between umi and the places mentioned above: price umi a big burrito joint is much more expensive than other sushi places in town that said if you have the dough go for the $75person omakase we enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course) each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh (now we're broke but that's my cross to bear) the black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites the prices on the a-la-carte sushi in contrast looked only slightly more costly than others in townthe second difference: innovation sometimes i just want straight-up unadorned sushi and when i do i doubt i'll come back to umi however if i'm looking for a fine dining experience one where the ingredients are creative and innovative i'll definitely return here one of the best meals i've had in pgh yeta final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation the restaurant was packed when we were there and due to its small size i doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night
1,sushi in pittsburgh that i've found so far  so what qualifies me as knowing good sushi  first off i'm japanese american )  not saying that other ethnic backgrounds don't know what good sushi is  by the reviews i can tell that they do  but keep in mind i have been eating sushi my whole life  the price of food is a little higher than one might expect  so if you're a casual sushi eater you might think twice before coming here  the restaurant setting feels pretty authentic  be sure to make reservations
1,nice quiet atmosphere with good service and excellent food i've tried many sushi places in pittsburgh and flavorpresentation wise this was clearly the winner the sushi here is so good you want to just let it melt in your mouth and savor each piece only drawback is the price highly recommended
1,favorite restaurant in townhere is the deal with umi - if you are a casual sushi eater and just a fan of your basic rolls and stuff don't bother going here umi is expensive rolls will seem small - same as the sashimi and nigirihowever it is so darn delicious i can't even describe it  if i could i would go to umi every night  it's simply that good  it's well well worth every cent you will spendalso try the rock shrimp  oh mani think i am gonna go make a reservation right now
1,is the real dealin pittsburgh don't expect flop down for a casual california roll here they take the sushi and the experience very seriously the downside is that it you'll never be satisfied with average sushi againpro tip: make reservations days in advance
1,has always been my favorite chinese restaurant in the pgh area food is consistently very good - general tso's is tender not the shoe leather i sometimes get at other places steamed dumplings wonton soup lo-mein all terrific
1,very particular about asian food let me emphasize very one more time veryi usually have poor experiences but i was pleasantly surprised with tai pei both times i dined there i was greeted which seems to be a lost art these days and seated immediately my waiter was just around the corner and greeted me with water both times i ordered sushi i was able to see it being prepared which is always a plus my waiter was quick and served me as soon as the sushi was ready the second time i went i ordered sushi and an entree the service was good but took a while for my main dish to be served i only mention this since the restaurant wasn't packedstill the food was wonderfully prepared i consider tai pei one of my favorite spots
1,i ate here was just amazing    i too am picky with chinese food as there are so many places that serve sub par food  this is not one of them  i will definitely be going back
1,every aspect (besides our weird waiter) was great  my food tasted very fresh and even though the server was a bit awkward and strange he was very attentive  it's the best chinese food i've had in ages
1,good food and good service the chinese is the best and most authentic in the area
1,excellent  i enjoy their sushi and know when i get a chicken dish i don't have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat   i typically do take out and it is well worth the drive
1,chinese food   every time we have ordered take out from here it's been great  egg rolls general tso's happy family triple delight dumplingsall taste delicious
1,have only had takeout from tai pei but the chicken lo mein was delicious and the general tso's was the best i have ever had it was sweet but still had a kick to it nothing was over priced and we weren't waiting forever for delivery will definitely visit the restaurant in the future
1,food here is very good i've frequented the restaurant many times for sushi noodles rice and plenty of their other dishes the atmosphere is also great and the service is very friendly i would definitely recommend taipei if you're craving chinese and sushi
1,always loved this bar and have gone since it opened  love paul the best bartender in the world once he waits on you you pretty much never have to tell him your order again great apps  but i must admit i haven't gone lately due to having to pay to park after 5pm  think its ridiculous  great people watching 
1,never been for the food but on a fridaysaturday night love going for a great margarita and for a good price i've tried margarita's all over charlotte not to sound like a slush but this one is the best by far
1,been going to fujo's for the last 5 months or so and i must say that after a long day of work their seafood su and dragon roll always hit the spot  they also have chinese food if you actually want your fish cooked  and the service is consistently fast and friendly  five stars
1,is the first time i've been here  first of all the singapore noodles was the best i have ever tasted in my life and i've had several  the waitress was great  the bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away  i don't mind saying i may eat here again tomorrow
1,staying in uptown charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner based on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable priced well reviewed ready walking distance option from our hotel  this one is rated with two $$  truthfully some of the best sushi i've ever had  my boyfriend and i split 3 rolls; the coastal roll panther roll and the godzilla roll  they were not skimpy by any means there was almost am entire roll left when i had to give up so the man happily picked up the slack  i'm only on town for the weekend so i have no idea if they run specials throughout the week  i will absolutely come back next time i'm here and will recommend to my friend who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)
1,was traveling for work and stayed at the hilton so figured i would check fujo out great service and really delicious sushi the prices were very reasonable and the portions were large i got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good i also got a rainbow martini which was yummy i'll definitely go back when i travel to charlotte
1,know what's crazy i've been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time i've actually checked in i gotta step my game up anyhow godzilla sushi roll is the truth you can't go wrong ordering that i'm seriously stuffed after eating i mean the crunchy tempura outside the savory sauce the fresh avocado the ingredients make love in my mouth seriously in my opinion there's no need to try anything elseservice is spot on every time i'm there everyone is very attentive and you can't beat the area i always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile even if i have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday it's worth it i go hard for some sushi especially the godzilla roll get on it
1,am from cali; and we love our sushi; was worried that i might never find good sushi while here this place proved me wrong; great sushi; super quick for call ins and across fom my school; so excited might be a weekly place for me
1,a groupon here to try it out and decided to buy another because we knew we'd come backgo for dinner sit outside and enjoy an amazing view of downtown something you can't really get from many uptown restaurants views of many buildings but set back from the street just a really great location for eveningsushi: they have interesting rolls like ones with sweet potatoes that i've never seen any where else really yummy sushi of all typesdrinks: really good mixed drinks and sake limited wine and beerservice: truly excellent
1,have had a lot of good sushi in charlotte but the godzilla roll at fujo just completely blew me away  it is the best sushi i have ever had  delicious just doesn't fully describe it  when the menu says "must try" they aren't kidding  it is spicy tuna and avocado fried tempura style and topped with special sauce  the sauce was superb  the roll is large so it is a good one to share but you won't want to because you will want to eat it all yourself
1,you ever left a place and thought: what took me so long to get here that happened to me at fujo's my girlfriends and i celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off yep i'm officially a fan i'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi we started with the steamed pork dumplings classic i also ordered the rainbow martini-- it's cranberry vodka pineapple and midori the presentation was excellent and they were very heavy handed with the liquor  and there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl that thing is deliciousbut let's get to what everyone wants to know aboutthe sushi i ordered the godzilla roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my "go to" roll when i'm here i clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a "must try" on the menu it's packed with spicy tuna avocado and then deep fried tempura style my goodness how could you go wrong with that combination  do yourself a favor and get over to fujo's it's definitely worth a try
1,sushi i've had so far in charlotte make sure you try their coastal roll; my husband and i were floored by the sushi quality and the pricewonderful restaurant and evening all around
1,sushi i have had in charlotte
1,sushi reviewcuisine malayapacific rim shotone of the best features of this establishment is its choice location it's not so out-of-the-way that you have to travel to nightlife and not so on-the-scene that it would attract curious passers-by i first visited this place to sample the indian fare which had a good spin on the campus at cpcc of course i was drawn to the cliche 1950's pacific-rim archaeologist motif (fan-tan folding fans bamboo etc) but it was just slightly interesting as compared to the sushi menu which was surprisingly diverse the maki rolls were above average and the soundboy roll (spicy tuna or smoked salmon philly tempura) was very good they have a good selection of japanese beer and the house sake is the only warm sake on the menu so there is no immediate reason to order the fancy-pants selections unless you are trying to impress someone - but that can easily backfire like a '79 dodge aspen going up a hill stick to what you know or at least what you have learned so far the maki is solid and the nagiri is good as well the price is a little above average but you get a decent portion of good sushi try the asahi bottled beer with the warm house sake if you bring a date you can easily share the indian pancake is great for a shared appetizer the indian side of the menu is pretty good as well so give it a shot on your following visiti recommend malaya overall for the sushi location and atmosphere afterward you can take the short drive uptown and check out the scene
1,time i've eaten here i've been pleased with the food  the beef rendang is wonderful--the lemon grass flavor is prominent and the pepper is just right--not overpowering  you'll want to start off with the roti canai appetizer which is great--just don't dribble the curry sauce on your tie 'cause it ain't coming out  the peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun too  the mango chicken is aromatic and tasty but i prefer their rendang to anything else  i think they do a fine job with the sushi and rolls as well  i'm looking forward to trying other items here  if you're not sure about this place try it  i think you'll like it
1,of the best asian restaurants in charlotte hands down i was shocked it was not already on yelpthey specialize in malasian food but offer a fusion of japanese (sushi & hibachi) chinese and thai inspired dishes honestly i have not tried the hibachi but the sushi is among the best even over sushi specific restaurantsdon't be scared of the term "malasian" if you are not familiar with it there is not a single person i have ever taken there that has not loved it and become a regular patron even the "standard" chinese restaurant dishes are really good- kung pao chicken or shrimp chow fun and fried rice try the roti telur for an appetizer it's a savory curry broth with potatoes (don't think of indian curry) it's mild and i think it tastes similar to thai massaman curry comes with homemade bread pancakes for dipping also the beef satay is very goodthe wait staff is usually very helpful to new customers that are not familiar with the dishesthey do a great lunch menu and are very fast with servicelocated next to cpcc campus downtown this place is a must try
1,place for authentic south east asian cuisine malay indo chinese i have been here once before and really enjoyed the food having spent time in indonesia it is hard to find true authentic food from there this is the only place in charlotte for the real deal if ian is in ask for him to help you make your food selection there is much that isn't on the menu ian is the bartender an server he is malay and speaks excellent english and has an amazing amount of knowledge about the culture and food influences throughout the se asian peninsula ian hooked us up last night with some outstanding malay dishes we had sea bass that was lightly battered with a mouth watering curry with eggplant green beans okra and onions the spices in this dish blended perfectly well and i began to understand some of the differences between indonesian and malay cuisine that ian had tried to explain we also had the beef rendang that was tender and fragrant this is slow cooked beef in coconut milk and spices we topped off our meal with a asian style flat pancake folded over some ground  peanuts and palm sugar that was grilled in a pan to blend the flavors and served with vanilla ice cream  the only thing that could have enhanced this dish might be a drizzle of chocolate sauce yumwe look forward to returning and having ian take care of us again
1,of the best spicy tuna rolls in town love the hot and sour soup and they are always so nice in there my fiance is not impressed with the chinese food on the menu but the rest makes up for it plus they deliver :)
1,loved loved cuisine malaya in fact i immediately wanted to rush home and lose my yelp virginity after eating here when you first walk in it looks like your run of the mill asian style restaurant don't let that fool you there is magic in the food and service orchids hang in boxes on the wall there is a bar to sit at where the sushi chef rolls his art and pop music plays on the speakers  once seated we were almost immediately welcomed by our server ian ladies and gentlemen if you can request ian upon arriving do it he is malaysian and gives you a rundown of all of the cultures that contribute to malay cuisine this gives you an idea of some of the items that you would like to try he also brought a sample of curry to gauge our tastes after the sample we practically put our faith in his hands and let him suggest whatever my friend and i decided to go with the beef rendang (which is so good it will make you scream booyah) and  the basil duck the basil duck was off the menu it came with stir-fry style veggies and the duck on the side warning this dish may make you moan like homer simpson the duck is that good we also tried a few imported beers thanks to our oh-so-helpful ian i would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for different flavors i had a really great experience and look forward to more
1,malaya is probably one of my favorite restaurants in charlotte it is also a really good place to go with large groups because they have plenty of space there is never a wait and they can accommodate very large groups at one table also the last 2 birthday celebrations we had there with large friend groups we called in advance to make the reservation and let them know it was a birthday party and they put up decorations in our area that we were seated at that was definitely exemplary service  they also let us bring our own birthday cake and kept it in the fridge in the back and then cut and served it for us after blowing out the candles  now on to the food  the food is always so good  they are also very large portions so definitely can share one dish between 2 people  the roti tellur appetizer is amazing and a must to order if you have never had it  i also really like the kung pao tofu - the tofu has the perfect texture and crispness  you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - everything i have had has been great
1,place has delicious food and good service  my favs are the curry lakhsa mee goreng and tom yum soup  it's gotten to the point where my addiction is obvious  i literally eat here once a week now and if i don't they get worried about me  the other great thing is that if you want to change up your order (like add more veggies to the sesame tofu also delicious) no problem
1,service and fresh foods   upon reading the yelpers reviews hubby and i decided to try cuisine malaya  we had a wonderful server  ian  he guided us through the delicious meal  his suggestions were great   excellent place  delicious

1,nicest people you will ever meet  i have been going here once per week for a few weeks for polish changes  they do a great job and make it an enjoyable experience  it is very clean inside and nicely decorated i rarely have to wait more than 5 minutes and they never seem rushed  i usually have my 3 year old with me who sits on my lap and they talk with her and make her smile  i am finally getting to writing a review because of a wonderful experience i had today  i decided to take my two girls in for valentine's day nail painting as a special treat  my oldest went first and i was watching with my other daughter on my lap  my youngest accidentally bumped a bottle of nail polish off the table which proceeded to smash all over the floor  i was mortified  they immediately began telling me "don't worry don't worry" and my daughter was looking pretty sad because she knew she messed up  they were coming up to her and saying "don't be sad it's ok"  afterward when they wanted to charge me next to nothing for doing the girls' nails i wanted to leave a large tip as an apology and a thank you  they wouldn't let me  so of course i did anyway and just told the gals to split it  i still feel terrible about the mess but am amazed at how nice they were about it  please go here and support these folks and their wonderful business
1,am a loyal customer of cobblestone nail studio for more than 13 years when i lived in the west valley i traveled 40 miles one way to have my nail services performed cobblestone is truly the best nail studio of its class the atomosphere at the studio is fun and the customers are treated like family the owner su is awesome i highly recommend this establishment

1,took excellent care of me today  great job the place is clean spacious and inexpensive compared to most i'll be back for sure
1,went to cobblestone for the first time today and was beyond impressed i recently moved to tempe and stopped getting my gel manicures because i am so picky and particular that i just didn't want to deal with finding a new place the one day it rains in az i decided to give them a shot so glad i did as i have a new place and new technician i plan to religiously visit every 2 weeks
1,there for the first time today and i will definitely be going back rose did my nails and she is great she takes her time and really cares best manicure i have ever had-kim
1,here every 2 12 weeks adore this place always a perfect job friendly service clean and relaxing
1,having been going to su to have my nail tips done for 14 years  i have never had a nail lift or ever had a fungus  there have been times i have not been able to get back for a month and still no problem  i also have pedicures by eileen and they last just as long the establishment is always clean and the staff is very friendly  i give the highest rating possible and advise everyone to give them a chance
1,a cosmetologist who had the brilliant idea of doing her own acrylic nails why i thought i'd be able to do them beautifully when i hadn't done nails since cosmo school is beyond me but i was up for the challenge i guess well it turned out (you guessed it) to be a complete disaster i did them wednesday night and thursday morning wanted them off i was pressed for time because of work and bc of leaving for san diego today (friday)the owner and his wife were more than accommodating he pushed back his gym session thursday evening bc he knew this was a 'nail emergency' and his wife took over to do the nail art design i had a picture from pinterest that i showed them and they matched it as closely as possible and it turned out very nice i posted a picture (mine is the blue gold glitter and peacock feather)they were all very friendly and welcoming and you can tell they really enjoy doing nails-it shows in their work and what perfectionists they arei asked how long they'd been there and he said since 2000 which was really surprising to me because the place is so clean it looks like they just openedso as a nail salon it really doesn't get much better than this they've won me over which really doesn't happen often since they're pretty much on every cornerhad to spread the wordkelsey
1,place to have a girls day of pampering
1,been going to this spa for several years now  the ambiance is great  while waiting for my spa treatment i relax in their quiet room and enjoy a glass of wine and some snacks the owner maryann gives excellent facials and does amazing permanent makeup  i had my eyebrows and eyeliner done  it looks so natural  she knows what she's doing  i get my massages here too and even bikini waxes  if you want a great haircut and color see brandon or kim  it's awesome to be able to come to one place for all these services and know that you'll be taken care of  i would recommend this spa to anyone
1,chaps is the best hair stylist i have been going to him for 12 years all over color hi lights and cut
1,was visiting friends in las vegas and needed a haircut i just happened to see this place walked in and james took amazing care of me  he was extremely friendly professional (but with a great sense of humor) and so helpful in guiding me to my best "look"  you must go see james
1,5 stars for julie she's the only one i'll let touch my hands and feet i followed her from luxy nail salon it's worth the extra 5 min to get my nails done shes germafobic so i know i'm safe the salon is really nice clean and quiet i'm glad that she transferred it's a way nicer place
1,there with two friends on a trip to vegas and it was wonderful  atmosphere top notch staff was professional and friendly and prices reasonable  definite stop in vegas
1,love this place friendly staffgreat facialsgreat permanent makeupgreat atmosphere
1,is my new go-to place for pampering lots of services to choose from i'm still exploring the options but i love my facials by wendy top notch pro and maryann's vascular treatment for facial blemishes is nothing short of amazing (there's a bit of a healing process to plan for but the results are remarkable) the support staff is warm and friendly the spa area is cozy and relaxing and mimosas are served as you prepare to  let your cares melt away the spa is a challenge to find the first time but well worth the effort to keep looking next time i'll be back for a couple's spa day can't wait
1,randomly found this place through a spawish gift card what a findi'm a last minute lucy i called for a full head of highlights base and cut appointment for the next day and they were extremely accommodating getting me right in and setting me up with leslie she was fantastic very nice welcoming and a wizard with foil (and there was a lot of foil) it had been a long time since i had my hair done when you're that neglectful and asking so much you never really know what end result you're going to get but i was pleasantly surprised leslie was very thorough and carefully in transforming me back into the natural blonde i should have been looks like i found my new hair magician
1,girlfriends and myself had a fabulous spa day here  we flew into las vegas rented a car and went straight to the spa  i had arranged all of our appointments with jackie and we can't praise her enough for the great professional service she gave us  we each had facials massages manis and pedis and in between treatments we relaxed in the nicely appointed lounge area  where we were served mimosas and snacks  each of us were so happy with our treatments the package price was very reasonable and we all left refreshed and ready to start our vacation in las vegas highly recommend this spa  everyone is very friendly and attentive  we hope to return again and make this our first stop before going any place else  thank you jackie and to all the staff that made the start of our vacation so great  i rated the price as moderate because compared to what the big casino spas want for just a massagethis is priced so fair for the package we received sylvia r
1,your in need of any permanent makeup this is the place  i have been to many permanent makeup places over the years and this place exceeds  min is the artist and she does outstanding workshe listens to how you want your makeup done the color the shape and when she finishes it's just as you described iti had my eyebrows done  this is not something you want to trust anyone doing but after i was refered to min i thought i'd try it  i was pleased
1,had my eyebrows tattooed 5 years ago by min and she does free follow-up annual touch-ups for up to 5 years so i had them touched up at least twice scheduling the free follow-ups are about 2 months out so it's not like you can just walk in however it's pretty cool that she offers iti was very happy with my brows and have since gone in for some of the facial with led light treatment packages to reduce the age spots freckles on my face the process of ridding some of the larger dark spots include burning them off and then staying out of the sun while the skin heals back a lighter more blended tone to the rest of your face she also gives you a bleaching cream to put on the skin to further ensure lightening of the spots it worked my face looks more clear than before the treatments i'll be returning to try out the 3d eyebrows and will update the review once it's done
1,have since gone back for my 3d eyebrows and i'm very happy with them pricing is affordable and really awesome that i no longer have to pencil in my eyebrows or worry about rubbing my eyebrows off during the day i've uploaded a picture of my 3d eyebrows after having them done about a year ago and since having 2 touch ups i go back about once every 3 to 4 months recently i paid for 5 dermabrasion facials and 16 led light treatments unfortunately my schedule sucks ass lately and i can't seem to find time to actually go back and do the facials waaaah
1,fast easy professional
1,has been doing permanent makeup for something around 30+ years i got my eyebrows done by her about a year agopros:- min is very experienced  - permanent makeup comes with 5 free appointments for touch ups - competitive prices- rooms are clean - variety of services offered- friendly and helpful staffconsultbefore the tattooing: an assistant draws in the shape you want with an eyeliner pencil i did have some doubt right before i got my brows done my natural eyebrows were very thin and each were very different in shape length etc and it's always been difficult to draw them on evenly but the assistant was very patient and helpful and spent probably half an hour making my eyebrows the shape i wanted them getting them tattooed: min having been doing this for so long is confident in what she does so she does move a little fast but be assured she knows exactly what she's doing i told her i was still a little unsure of the shape of my right brow but she said not to worry she would fix it and she picked a color that would look good on me obviously when you're about to have something tattooed onto your face you want to be 100% sure about everything before you start i had a little doubt about the shape of the right brow and if the color was too dark but i couldn't be more happy with the results my brows look very natural and people are surprised when i tell them they're tattooed because of how subtle and natural they are overall: would recommend experienced and friendly great prices i'm very happy with my permanent eyebrows
1,love coming to min's  i been coming since i was 17 and now i'm 27 i only trust min her staff is always polite and knowledgeable and min does an awesome job as always i never have to wait long nor tell her what i need min always knows what's best for her clients my mom comes here now to and she loves her eyebrows
1,foot massage was better than you could even imaginebest in my lifebetter than a 10this man knows every pressure point it is so much better than i expected i have been having permanent makeup done there for a few years with wonderful results  the place is always spotless and the staff is nice as welltreat yourself herea thankful customer
1,3d eyebrows and full lips done this last monday i am very very happy with the results i look totally natural min is very professional and accommodating her assistant is very sweet and pleasant i was a really big baby about the pain to my lips when they were done but min worked with me and got me through it (lips hurt a lot) i will go back in 3 months to have the touchups done and maybe get eyeliner done too i would recommend min's permanent makeup for anyone looking to enhance there looks with a very talented makeup tattoo artist
1,stylist is danyl and she is the best hair stylist colorist i have ever met her talent nohow and current knowledge with the latest movement in hair is refreshing and worth every bit she charges and more she doesn't over price she gives her all to you during your appointment and her personality is an a+ she is innovative and fresh soon the salon will be moving to a new building right up the street and i believe that this will only amplify her cliential so if you want a great stylistbook now
1,am a bit psycho when it comes to my locks i have never gone to the same stylist more than 2 or 3 times because they could never get it right i bet i have tried 100 salons in vegas over the years and was never satisfied they could either color well but cut disastrously or cut great but couldn't style right etc  your stylist has a huge impact on your appearance ya knowafter extensive research on finding an awesome colorist kim at montage was recommended after my first visit i was completely transformed i swear i looked like a different person the attention care and great price cannot be matched anywhere in this town  i believe a cutcolor from kim is reasonably priced given the competition (she smokes them) and the quality of service she provides kim has been my stylist for eight years now and i can't even imagine going to anyone else - it would totally feel like cheating i have never had a bad haircut or color so many people have asked me about my hair and several friends and coworkers are now loyal to her as welloh and the new montage is just beautiful very impressive with a merle norman studio attached to it  and they sell all the products from moroccanoilyummmmmm
1,shop  my husband & i have gone to felice the owner for over 20 years  this is a new location for her shop   good service you won't be disappointed
1,is a review i wrote for tammy back in december 2011 (nothing has changed my hair still looks and feels amazing):tammy lord is maybe the 1 most amazing hairdresser ever and i am hating myself as i write this review since everyone is going to want to go to her after (and i will never get in to see her) but still she needs to props she deserves i don't really know how she hasn't been reviewed yet by anyone else but i guess i will be the first tammy has taken my hair from major bleh to people think my hair looks amazing 6 months+ after its been done by tammy perfect color perfect cuts every time i guess what spurned this review after so long(i've been her client for a few years) is that i just had my hair done here in san diego by someone else and i almost cried when he took the towel off my head the color was not right he used the bleach for the highlights but totally effed up my low-lights (tammy if you are reading this i'm coming in in januaryi need you) they do not match my hair at all my sister and mom go to tammy as well they came down to see me for thanksgiving last week took one look at my hair and saidwhy is it orange you need to go see tammy asap to top it off he cut these randoms bits of my hair different odd lengths "to make it healthy" so my hair looks all choppy and short in some places and long in others it's just awful and if you've seen my profile pic you'll see my hair and see how beautiful it is thanks only to tammy (pic was taken in february 2 months after she did it) so it's true folks tammy is a miracle worker she's fixed my hair before when its been botched by these people here in sd and i'm sure this won't be the last time she'll have to do it she's also incredibly smart interesting funny and will always make you feel better about yourself after sitting in her chair for a few hours it's like a therapy session + hair therapy sessionwhat could be better and don't even let me forget her head massagesomg i gotta stop here because now tammy is going to be busier than ever love love love you tammyupdate (1112012): i still go to tammy even though i don't live in las vegas anymore i have 100% complete faith in her and will never go see anyone else
1,shop when you're in vegas you must see alice  we were visiting and read the great reviews on yelp so decided to give this shop a shot  the heat sun and pool had killed my girls hair and since it's vegas she wanted to look hot for a night out  so we went with a new cut and put some lifecolor back in her hair this salon is really nice and spacious - they invested some money in the decor alice knew exactly what to do with her hair   always nice to have your girl turning heads as you walk around town
1,the best haircut i had in many years from suzanne the overall experience was wonderful the entire staff was friendly and professional
1,believe how awesome my hair turned out i keep checking it out in the mirror and running my hands through it and to top it off alice not only rocked my hair she is a very funny down to earth lady totally kept me entertained
1,alberro is the bombcom i love my hair thanks tracyyou are the best
1,had my haircut with john he is  an amazing hair stylist  i just moved back to vegas and found this salon through a friend the salon is very nice as well  i didnt want to spend $45 for hair cut as first but it worth it  it is an experience :)
1,searched on yelp and made a few calls for permanent makeup (eyebrows) based on reviews when i called the montage they said cindie did brows but she wasn't in they gave me her cell number and said i could call her directly i called left her a message and she returned my call and would be happy to see me 2 hours later the salon is higher end and quite nice the staff were friendly and nice cindie was there ready for me the room was very clean and comfortable cindie is very experienced doing permanent makeup since 1991 she drew the perfect brows on me and we got to work immediately quick easy minimal pain and cindie was an absolute pleasure i am so happy with my new brows a+++++
1,went to theresa for a skin condition on my arms and legs that i have had for years  the dermatologists prescribed creams that did absolutely nothing  she knew right away what treatments would help my condition and the best part was i could do them at home myself for very little money  my arms are now completely healed & my legs are almost cleared  i am actually able to grow hair again where i was not able to before  theresa is professional & very informative  i got quite an education  i can't say thank you enough for what she did for me  i will only trust my skin to her  thanks theresa
1,many people compliment my lashes  i have had lash extensions since feb of this year  i went and had a new fresh set applied last month she has great attention to detail and is a professional perfectionist  i absolutely love my  lashes now more than i ever had  my makeup routine is quick and simple because i can simply go light and not worry about eyeliners and mascaras  they last several weeks too  her prices for full sets and touchups are extremely reasonable  i live in n phx but its undoubtably worth the trip  i recommend her to anyone looking to give lash extensions a try   be sure to check out her gallery onlinecheck out their website for deals as well
1,is an awesome person and esthetician
1,got my eyelash extensions here by theresa she is an excellent aesthetician very educational as she spent 30 min on the phone explaining the process to me and answering my questions the place is in the moda solons building suitr 107 but don't be surprised its not a suite really just a small room when i went  in she explained everything as she was doing it an is a really great person great conversation she made it all relaxing and i didn't feel a thing you will be comfortable and certainly pleased with whatever service you get her attention to detail with the lashes was impressive and i will be a long time repeat customer due to her excellent servicealso be sure to check in to get an extra 10% off services
1,review yelp took my first one down i love this place and i couldn't think of a beter place to go theresa is awesome
1,is amazingher customer serviceand professionalism is the best my eyelashes have never looked better i highly recommend her services
1,started seeing theresa for eyelash extensions in early october (i wanted to be ready for my husband's christmas party) i had them before a few years back so i consider myself a bit of a 'pro' well let me tell you theresa had them on in half the time for half the money with twice as many lashes she is fantastic i was amazed at the absolute wonderful job she did i decided to keep them on even longer then i was planning i love them that much
1,and joanne at forever young aesthetics are a dream team joanne was amazingly kind accommodating and responsive to all of my complicated appointment booking needs (i reside in flagstaff and wished to make the trip to surprise just for theresa's permanent makeup artistry) and theresa simply has to be the very best in the business not only was the procedure for permanent eyeliner and brows discussed thoroughly with me prior to choosing a single color i was made to feel completely at ease and fully confident in my choice to proceed as one would expect from a talent like theresa the results of my permanent makeup are absolutely perfect and simply put stunning in fact i was making my way through a local grocery store less than 30 minutes post procedure and was stopped twice in the aisles for compliments on the color of my eyes i my book that's a five star review for forever young aesthetics right therea million thanks are owed to theresa and joanne for their phenomenal customer service and the fantastic results when you can enter a business a customer and leave a friend you know you've found something truly special
1,is by far the best when it comes to permanent make-up and caring about people  karla fixed my brows that were gun metal black and too arched and made them look nice and brown again  karla also removed a lipliner i had done in vegas too by someone else (big mistake) but i had not know about karla at the time; but karla removed the lipliner that was placed above my natural lip line and saved my facei would not recommend anyone else but karla and wake up in your makeup if you are thinking about geting any type of permanent makeup  this is your face  karla does care
1,have always wanted to get permanent makeup but could never decide on who to go to after asking around and getting a lot of input from my friends i found karla kwist i am so happy that i did i had my eyebrows and eyeliner done a week ago and i am so excited about the way i look and feel karla is such a wonder she is so educated in the permanent makeup field i knew right away i was in capable hands thank you karla for the new me
1,went to karla for eyeliner and i couldn't have been happier with my results she talked to me about the procedure and was very knowledgeable she answered all my questions and more i have had two friends go to other places in town and come out with horrible results i sent them to karla and she was able to help them correct what had been done previously it also doesn't hurt that she is one of the nicest people i have ever met and i will continue to go to her for all of my permanent makeup needs i wouldn't trust anybody else with my face
1,place ever and best people they do a good job and they are so nice the prices are awesome they provide a great service i'm happy and satisfied of my nails and my eyelash extension
1,honestly don't where to even start my friend and i decided to get our nails done after school so we looked for a groupon and found holly's nail & spa we purchased our groupon's and called to book an appointment for almond acrylic sets we found pictures of what we wanted and showed our nail technicians susan and holly they were very polite patient and made sure we had a mutual understanding of what us the clients were wanting throughout the manicures they were very thorough and held conversations with us i enjoyed conversating with my technician holly she was fun and very energetic while she gave me my manicure once she finished shaping my nails and lead me to the washing station i glanced at my nails and my mouth dropped i have never hady nails look so perfect in my entire life each nails was perfectly even smooth and the exact shape i wanted (mind you this was before they were polished and designed) soon after my friend devon texted me saying "omg i'm in love" once holly began polishing she coated each nail multiple times and very evenly i had asked for glitter on my index finger thinking it was extra to my surprise it was not i am just in shock at how gorgeous my nails look and holly will be my new nail technician for as along as i live in arizona thank you again holly and susan and i will be returning soon if you are considering going to visit this nail salon i recommend you stop considering and call to book your appointment as soon as possible your money will be well spent
1,& my future mother n law came in for a gel mani pedicure for my birthday the staff was very professional & they did a beautiful job we were both very pleased this is a great nail salon the owner holly was so sweet
1,had never had permanent makeup done and had lost my brows due to chemo and age denise was patient and matched the color i asked for i was concerned because i'm blonde and didn't want brows that looked too dark or unnatural i've had nothing but compliments from everyone and love the work she's done i highly recommend her work
1,did a wonderful job on my eyes i had the eyeliner on the top and bottom done it is a tattoo so needless to say it was a little painful what beauty is painless i did let my anxiety get the best of me and poor denise had to stop a million times
1,is very professional and does an exceptional job i would recommend her to anyone she takes the time to explain everything and answers all your questions would not go anywhere else
1,was very friendly upon meeting she first had me draw on my eyebrows with a pencil to get an idea of what i want she then made some suggestions that were very helpful and exactly what i wanted she seems very knowledgeable and experienced the procedure didn't take long she used a numbing cream to help reduce the pain after she finished she went over after care so far i like the work but i need to wait for it to heal which can take a few weeks to see final results i would definitely see denise again and recommend her to anyone wanting cosmetic tattooing
1,first got permanent brows about 6 or 7 years ago i was fortunate that the lady i picked to do them for me in tempe was pretty good the shape was something i could live with but the color turned reddish brown not good for my skin tone i had her touch them up a year later and again i could live with the result because no brow is going to be knockout amazing right in a couple of years i got lip and eyeliner done the lip liner i am totally happy with the eyeliner was spotty and a bit uneven in places but eyeliner rocks last year i found denise when she ran a special on eyeliner she redid mine evened out the rough spots and recommended that i go darker than what i asked for she was right and it looks wonderful i finally decided recently that my brows had faded way too much to be ok i was forced to fill in with pencil each day which to me is why i got permanent brows in the first place so that makeup application wasn't necessary every day right so i called denise who happened to be running another special and set up an appointment to do my brows last thursday at noon she had me draw the shape plus bring the pencil so she could be sure to match the shade when i got home i couldn't stop staring at them in the mirror the lines were so nice they looked awesome plus all the red tone was gone none peeking through today is tuesday i took good care to maintain a light layer of vaseline and didn't rub this evening they are done fully shed and beautiful i couldn't be happier they are amazing the color is perfect and they look so good i won't need to fill with pencilwhen i'm ready i will go back for an eyeliner refresher denise gets my business thank you denise
1,i could give denise more than five stars i would a few days ago i had my eyebrows tattooed today they look perfectly normal shaped beautifully and completely natural denise was very professional and friendly the building was decorated super cute and it was clean i will recommend denise to all my friends

1,originally called julianne yesterday (thurs aug 1) to schedule an appointment and i saw her today at noon she is located at the district in green valley she is room number 9 **inside** of sola salon behind the cheesecake factoryas soon as i walked into the lobby she was drawn to me she was warm friendly and introduced herself we went into her personal room which is glass (she has privacy drapes) she sat me down in a very comfortable recliner and told me a little about herself before we started to discuss my mistakei mean tattoojulianne is certified in micro-pigmentation which means she knows a lot about skin she is a member of the spcp (http:wwwspcporgthinking-of-getting-a-cosmetic-tattoofind-a-technician)she does tattoo removal with natural saline the saline removal process is a non-laser ink extraction  alternative very similar to the regular tattoo process in that it uses similar equipment and procedures  but instead of pushing ink into the skin the saline removal system uses a special solution - mostly of sea salt -to create an osmotic condition as the cells lift due to osmosis they push the ink  into the scab and out of the skin saline tattoo removal generally requires 50% to 75% fewer treatments than laser tattoo removal and unlike laser removal -- which relies on wavelengths to target  only specific colors -- saline tattoo removal method is effective on all colors of ink and on all areas of the body (http:dragonflyinkcomtattoo-removal)i have been nervous with laser seeing as how it actually burns skinshe told me that she would work on a few 2 inch sections at a time so that my body could heal properly and deal with the scabs correctlyabout 5 weeks she would also numb the area as well normally she only does small tattoos (my tattoo is 30 square inches) but she told me she is willing to work with me and that if i am willing to commit so is she at $100 an hour my husband and i feel that this is a better way then $400 a session laser that will take 7-12 sessionsi can not wait to schedule with her in these next few weeksshe is a true gem personality wise and i can't wait to work with her she seems to really care about who she does procedures on and what she does i read the filtered review on this place and it seems very positivei will do updates
1,the day has finally came the day for removal to beginjulianne is nothing but professional i was so impressed by our last visitthe removal starts with her taking a sterile needle (which she opens in front of me) and scratching it over the tattoo to allow the pain medicine to seep inthen the fun part starts she takes her tattoo gun and dips it into a solution of saline with the pain medicine i was very comfortableof course there were some tender spots (it's just like getting the tattoo all over again) we are doing two small sections with two different solutions to see which one works better with my skin and how i heal with them we will of course use the one that is most effective unlike laser it is not a "one size" fits all approach she sends me off with a care package and very detailed instructions on how to treat the wound for proper healing we have had communication making sure that i am doing well i don't even get that from my doctortoday is the second day with the wound and it is sensitive to touch and some clothing like my bra because of it's location i am excited to see how i heal in the next few weeks
1,another day with mrs juliannethis day was filled with "once again" (s) and some new items((something new)) please note that she is no longer located in room 9she has moved to room 15[sola salons the district gvr]the room is larger and decorated lovely there is a pin up feel to this roomrisque pictures included  ;)my first session a few months ago was a "test" strip testing two different solutions to see which one worked more effectively with my skin type and the mistakei mean tattoo **once again**i am warmly greeted by julianne she had ran out to get an ultra soft blanket for my support (and was still on time)**once again**before pulling out utensils julianne examines the previously treated spot addresses my questionsconcerns **once again**it is all about me my comfort and what would help make our session more productive our first session had me on my side and this time i was on my stomach julianne also gets me in the "mood" with musicmusic that i actually like no elevator or country music here  (by my choice i'm sure if you wanted country or classical she would pull up pandora for youwhich she offered to do for me)how can i not get in the mood of tattoo removal when jayz and drake is on lol((something new)) she now has a comfort fishy luckily i used her pinky fishy to have more support for my neckhead and fishy didn't have to soak up any of my tears ((something new)) the recliner is gone in its' place is a new chair that reminds me of one at the dentist's office in a faboosh snake print of course **once again**clean and sterile tools are open in front of me with julianne putting on a fresh pair of gloves the products she used on me were fresh she mixed them in front of methey haven't been sitting around for hours or daysthe anticipation is almost worse than the actual pain we start with a numbing process and get to work julianne takes my mind off the pain by having great conversation i don't think there was a thing that we didn't talk about todayhaha which is awesome who wants to sit in silence when you're getting needles dug into you and salt solution pumped inside you that would be awkward and painfulmy pictures are posted the letters (that have a pinkpurple circle around them) are almost invisible this is their second treatment the center looks like a big mass of sunscreen but that is a salt solution that we decided to leave on i would rather have a warm friendly consistent thoughtful professional quirky longer removal process than to have a quick solution and be treated like some cash cow number and i'd rather not have my super fair skin burned up by a laser well now that i've confessed my strange love for juliannemore updates and pictures to comethanks again julianne*****1062014********it has been brought to my attention that mrs julianne has bought a laser and will have it up and running in december  saline and laser tattoo removal will be offered exciting 
1,is so talented  she has done life changing work on my daughter who is now gleaming with confidence  julianne is so kind and very patient and she definitely stands behind her work  i am so grateful for her and her talents
1,went to see julianne about five months ago to have permanent eyeliner put on i have tremors and i am no longer able to apply eyeliner she is the most wonderfulprofessional and kind understanding lady i have ever met she made me feel like a queen for the day she did such a fantastic job i have never been so pleased about having anything done with my eyes it is such a relief not having to worry about putting on eyeliner when my head is shaking so bad and julianne really understood that i would recommend her for any tattoo removal permanent eyeliner tattoo eyebrows and so much more of the things that she is able to do we played around with make up application and she made me look so wonderful i would give anything to be as skilled as she is so if you're going to have anything done tattoo eyeliner tattooed eyebrows make up application tattoo removal and so many other services she is the place to go so if you want to feel beautiful and that you really matter then go see julianne instead of five stars i give her 10 thank you julianne for making my eyes look so great love you
1,think julianne is so kind and caring about her clients i went to see her again yesterday and she did a fantastic job on my eyeliner i have trouble putting on eyeliner so it is so wonderful to have permanent eyeliner i would recommend her to anyone who has special needs with the services that she provides such as tattoo removal permanent eyeliner and permanent eyebrows and so many more services she is now doing permanent hair removal so i am so excited to begin that service she makes you feel like you really count she is the most meticulous person i have ever been to i would recommend her 100% to anyone who needs services done that she providesthank you julianne for always making me feel special
1,have been going to christine for 6 years now she and her staff are warm welcoming and extremely talented the salon is relaxing refuge full of positive energy and the conversation matches the haircut (which is always top notch) because of christine katie and the rest of the crew i always look forward to haircut day
1,know how you say "i want a big change" but then you get in the stylist's chair and you're like "i'm looking for a change but only take about an inch off" and then you still want to cry when you leave the salon bc you're hair is too shorti lost 4 inches of hair and got bangs and i only wanted to cry a little bit when she made the first snip  i freaking loved my hair  lovedmyhair  bangs bangs  and not the kind that you thought would make you look like zooey deschanel but instead you look like you are 10 and your mom got your hair cut at fantastic sams and never ever ever lay rightbangs  like long sweeping bangs that fell right and made all my friends say "i wish i could pull of bangs"i love this place  they moved to lawrenceville a few years ago and i havent been to the new salon yet bc its been that long since i've had my haircut which is so sad  it's like witch craft what they do with hair and i need some magici highly recommend this salon
1,give a big thanks to this walgreens  i found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him  it is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendly
1,stars just based on the estee lauder counter the girls lisa and ann are extremely professional with their customers for example i get courtesy calls reminding me of special limited offers for face cleanser and serums one time i received a call from ann that they just received a special shipment of only a handful of gift sets for the holidays and that they could put one on hold for me since this stuff is pricey the associates make sure that your money is well spent they even help with the fragrances too got several men's fragrancees (polo red aqua di gio john paul gultier ck euphoria dolce and gabana sport) and complimentary body wash duffle bags and trial bottles too the boston store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance so all in all i base the ratings just on the two departments i visit most often this is not the typical department store that i am used to for clothes or shoes since it caters mostly to older folks but that's ok i don't go to boston store for clothes or shoes home decor isn't too bad either saw several glass santas and nativity sets that would look great if only i had more space
1,the massage therapist is great listened carefully what i had to say and took care with my shoulder amber the receptionist is also great
1,is by far the best stylist i've ever had  i recently moved to dc and have let my hair go for 6 months because i knew i'd be back home in madison around christmas and could sneak into ultimate and get my hair done rightwhen i first started going to tiffany i did what every girl does post-break-up  i sat in her chair and told her i didn't care what she did with my hair but that i needed something different  she gave me the perfect cut and color  i was stopped multiple times by strangers asking me where i had gotten my hair cut  it was stylish and professional - plus i could just blow dry it into shape no need to curl or use a straightening ironlove this place
1,love ultimate a friend referred me to alyssa and she is who has done my hair for the past two years she's great and always makes me hair better than i imagined the salon is nice other reviews say they are pricey but you get what you pay for i get a paraffin dip and neckscalp massage when i get my hair done i'm not sitting there all day like other places the front desk is very friendly and i even get mailed coupons for discounted services i will be going back as long as i'm living in madison :)
1,moving to dc a year and a half ago i continue returning to madison frequently to get my hair done by tiffany  she's the only one i'll let touch my hair and i always leave feeling like a million bucks  not only is she a wonderful stylist she's become a good friend of mine and i don't think i'm the only client of hers that feels that way
1,sister and i decided to give our mom a complete "makeover" as a gift i called multiple salons to inquire if they would be able to strip color out of my mom's hair (she decided to stop coloring her hair and let her hair grow out so she had greywhite on top and dark brown a few inches down)many of the salons said that it could not be done when i spoke with someone at the ultimate spa salon they stated that they would be able to lighten the color so it would blend better with her natural hair color the stylist was very nice discussed what she was going to be doing  she put lightener on my mom's hair a few times i was nervous that it wasn't going to work  she got a new hairstyle and when it was all done she looked fabulous  i was very pleased with how it came out  it was pricey to have it done but when it comes to a drastic change i'd say it's worth it
1,basically an upbeat positive personbut some days i'm not my normal corky self i arrived at perry monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in san franciscobut in phoenix for an hour please i mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time i should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking she then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form i went to the bathroom which featured a delightful scented candle and then sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair a surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first the massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her marina cut my hair and although she was not much of a talker was upbeat and gave me a great cut i've been looking for a great place in phoenix and found it no one will ever compare to my beloved cid at barbarella in san francisco but i do have a new favorite salon locally in the valley of the sun
1,has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years  whenever i walk out of there i cannot believe how my hair looks and i oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut  perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me what more can i askthe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once i've fallen asleep  once a couple years ago in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work they asked if i wanted anything to drink  i said only if you have vodka  next thing i know a clear drink on ice shows upand tasted suspiciously like vodka  no that's customer service
1,absolutely love perry monge salon  i have been going there since 2004 and it has never disappointed  the entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home  marina is amazing with hairi only wish she could style my hair every morning  the extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut  i spend 75% of my time in dallas and 25% of my time in phoenix but insist on only having my hair cut at perry monge
1,is no doubting that i am an aveda girl being in phoenix and having plenty of aveda salons around you would think i'd be beauty-heaven but when i left cleveland i was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so i scheduled my hair appointments around when i'd be flying home well as one could image that become very expensive so i finally decided to take a chance with perry monage downtown i'm so glad i did from the moment i walked in to the stylist they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color too there was a little up-selling me with products which i wasn't use to and i must admit i did cave but i mean aveda hello can we say amazingi'm still in love with aveda and i'm now in love with perry monage
1,hair cut in town clean facility friendly staff and they are always very welcoming definately recommend getting your hair cut hereactually i recommend getting them all cut - ha (hair cut humor is just awful) if you are in to hair products they have a great selection on aveda stuff
1,love this place the customer service is second to none the front desk staff is always friendly and helpful i have a great hairstylist and the other services i have received have been wonderful even when i am there just on my lunch break to pick up a few things i am always offered something to drink products are recommended but there is no pressure to make any purchases it's comfortable clean and the staff is always on time yay for perry monge
1,was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in colorado i went to my aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from perry monge marie luce ( sp) gave me a coupon for 2000 off so i decided to give it a tryomg from the moment i walked in i felt like royalty i think i was getting the first timeservice but not only did i get one of the best haircuts a styling a 5 minute back massage a very thorough hand massage a facial ( yep)eyebrow waxing a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino i wound up buying 3 products but i always buy something aveda when i go so it wasn't a hard selli love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 12200 what i had a 2000 off coupon but stillit was brilliant marketing i have found a new stylist and i will be faithful in getting a facial each time i go because it's so worth it i highly recommend marie luce she is amazing
1,ochoa amazing 2 months later and i'm still getting compliments on the cut and how healthy it looks i've been going there for about 4-5 years and will continue to do somarina will listen to you tell her what you want and she will give you ideas and suggestions she won't push anything including products though the products she recommends are always topnotch she won't make you feel like you have to purchase anything the staff is always very cheerful and happy to assist you with any questions tell marina maria sent you :)
1,at 5:15pm  they closed at 5:30 but told me to come by  i wish i knew the name of the woman who washed cut and styled my hair as well as plied me with champagne and did my makeup  i am not from phoenix but if i was i would never go anywher else
1,have been going to the perry monge salon for about 14 years  i love this place  if you are latina have curly hair and cannot find anyone to cut your hair andor style it because of the curl this is your place  saturdays are busy but i try to avoid them  i am lucky i work downtown so i am able to make an appt right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of saturdays  being a client for so long i have tried their spa waxing services and of course hair services and and happy with everything  i have even recommended this salon to many friends and family all of whom are still loyal clients  an added bonus my husband and i joined the aveda pure privilege program it took us approx 4 years of saving our points but in 2011 we had a 6 night stay in jamaica  it was absolutely wonderful  we stayed at the caves in negril complete with complimentary massages  since then we have saved another 44000 points and are looking forward to booking our 3 night stay in antigua next year when we reach 50000 points
1,customer service here i've used the pharmacy (drive through at night) and store during the day and both were excellent experiences by accident i left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees especially the manager and assistant managers were all very helpful in keeping it safe for me until i was able to retrieve it
1,is the best bike store i've walked into  their primary focus is on racing bikes but (as i'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price rangesgot greeted by the staff and my girlfriend and i got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes  she explained what she was looking for and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at  i wound up talking to another person working there and let them try to find a bike that fit  (i'm 6'8" and as i found out fit pretty well on an xxl scott 65cm frame)anyways back to my girlfriend's experience  what impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there  and then when she came back in two minutes told her that wasn't ideal and sent her back out with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill  after she figured out yes that was the bike the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem adding a seat with a little more travel and getting everything just so  there was no hurry  there was no pressurethe amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits it's worth it to browse hereand update: i went out the other day and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike i tooled around on there two weeks ago  without batting an eye and without a hint of bike snobbery the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me  i talked to him about the differences between a double and triple and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons and gave a strong suggestion on the double  that said the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike  i asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike and he quoted me about half the price i expected from doing research on the internet  customer-friendly well priced super-high-quality bicycles  a+++edit 4 years later: glen beth and the rest of the crew here are still there and still awesome  my girlfriend is now my wife  my lowend trek road bike now has more miles on it  :-)it's still a much longer drive to get to big bang but for any work on my bike i'm glad to make the drive  friends have terrific luck with pittsburgh pro which is nearer  and i'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said for drop-off-the-bike work big bang is my absolute go-to
1,is the best experience i've had at a bike store in the pittsburgh area  i have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever meaning that i'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out)  also since i'm a student i don't have particularly deep pocketsat big bang i was greeted basically the moment i walked in the door  i'm kind of shy when i know that i don't really know what i'm doing but i wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff  even though my price range was pretty low they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price)  they take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bikealso this is one of the few bike stores i've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged rather than grudgingly allowed  definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you "you haven't tried it out enough go climb up the hill on  it" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike rather than making a quick salei would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me
1,wrote this review right after i had bought my bike  i would like to update to reflect further experiences i've had with bbbso first of all one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the shimano short-reach shifters also totally not the shop's fault -- these things happen)  since it was covered under warranty bbb switched it out for a new set of shifters at no cost to me  i had my bike back in a couple days no muss no fussmy husband got a used road bike from craigslist and we brought it in for a tuneup  the bike had several things wrong with it due to a shoddy assembly job and bbb basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits  i can't remember the total cost of this but it was under $100i would totally recommend bbb due to their general awesomeness  i haven't had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop even when bringing in a bike that i haven't bought there
1,created an account just to review this shop it's that awesomethis is by far the premier shop in all of western pa and arguably the state glenn the shop owner is one of the most knowledgeable men in the us when it comes to cycling  having spent time in europe and with some of the biggest names in the industry he truly knows what he's talking aboutfurthermore; he's a pleasure to talk to incredibly friendly and passionate as anything about the sport  as for bike fitting this is the only shop i would go to glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with and he is incredibly thoroughyes they equipment is expensive but that's a result of the quality they carrynot them setting prices high cycling is expensive end of story if you're looking to pick up your next huffy go to walmart if you want a quality bike that is going to fit you and operate perfectly: go to big bang
1,you walk out of big bang bikes you know you are buying a bike that fits you  glenn is amazing and he will help you reach your specific goals  he has amazing passion and knowledge to make you more efficient and comfortable  the best bike shopby far  great prices and service  we live in the north and won't hesitate to make the extra drive for anything bike related
1,customer service
1,place is the absolute best to purchase a bike i have been searching for a bike for a while now and every place i have gone to have not been near has helpful as glenn the one guy in the shop helped pick me a bike for what i needed and glenn fit me perfectly to the bike they also helped me with the bike rack on my car and changed my bike saddle for me ohhhh and they gave me the best price on the bike and accessories  wonderful service absolutely will go back  can't wait
1,got to be honest i don't think i've ever been as blown away by customer service as i was here i went in about half an hour before closing was not rushed at all i basically just walked in and said i was interested in a road bike but knew very little about them (i'm a mtbr) i was helped by glenn who within two minutes had me sitting on a bike measuring me and adjusting things and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike at no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact he didn't even ask me about a budget) he just gave me a few things to think about before i invest in something new he was very obviously focused on getting me the product that will give me the most efficiency and power for my needs so very impressedthis is absolutely where i will be buying my bike
1,you're in the market for a high quality bike whether it be road mountain racing or hybrid go to see glenn at bbb  it's very clear that he loves his shop and his job  i explained my needs and preferences to him and he quickly fitted me with a bike that suited my needs   i actually bought my trek 7300 over 3 years ago and i absolutely love it  he sells only the highest quality bikes and equipment  highly recommended
1,bang bicycles is phenomenal amazing selection and service i live in the san francisco bay area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available but i do most of my cycling shopping at big bang bicycles when i visit family in pittsburgh this shop carries top gear and has in stock tons of options so you can see feel and evaluate them first hand to know what's going to give you the best feel and performance glenn the owner is very knowledgeable friendly and you can feel his passion for cycling and making sure you get the right product and fit for you  even if you're not in the pittsburgh area but you know what you want -- send your order to big bang bicycles and i'm certain you'll have a great experience awesome shop thank you glenn and team
1,shop by far in the south hills  purchased a cannondale 29er there and have had numerous service visits for various bikes  always helpful and always call to let you know when service is fixed  if you are in the market for a cannondale in the south hills this place has better customer service by far than the other south hills cannondale dealer
1,shop  knowledgable staff very helpful   while during the summer they get pretty busy if you need something on short notice they will do their best to get the work done for you  reasonable prices great mechanics
1,have been coming here off and on for a few years even if i just stop in to browse the dudes who work there are always very helpful and don't seem annoyed tha ti lef twithout purchasing anything i my most recent visit i had my bike tuned up for the summeractually this is the first time i have ever allowed a professional to tuneup my bike and boy ami glad that i did it rides like a brand new bike again they also quoted me a price for the tune-up and it when it was said and done it came in right on target i'll definitely be bringing my ride back here every year for a tune-up
1,these guys are really good guys they provided free bike tune-ups along the ms 150 route if you guys are familiar with that i had an issue with my ride within 200 miles of riding and brought it in and they only charged me for partsno labor i really appreciate their demeanor and customer service they provided to me i never get a pretentious d-bag attitude when i come here
1,is a great little bike shop i went here looking for a hybrid and tried out a couple of different models one of the bikes i wanted to try they didn't have assembled in my size yet but rob said they would assemble it in my size and have it available for me to test ride either that afternoon or the next day i went back the next day to try it out and though i ended up liking the other (less expensive) model better i thought it was great that he was willing to assemble a bike just so that i could try it out to be sure of my decision he also threw in a bottle cage and kickstand for free when i bought the bike they may not have the biggest selection but this is a really amazing lbs that goes above and beyond for its customers
1,best place to buy a quality bike in pittsburgh the staff really loves cycling and shares their extensive knowledge with you to help find the best bike for you i didn't feel like i was being up-sold anything i really trust this place frequent customer for life
1,haven't been here yet but after reading about the bikes before christmas project here http:wwwpost-gazettecompg08311925595-94stm i just want to go here and buy some bike stuffmore about bikes before christmas here - http:iheartpghcom20081106donate-bikes-for-kids
1,the best bike shop in pittsburghlet me qualify that by saying if you are looking for a $12000 carbon triathlon bike this probably isn't the shopit is however the shop if you are looking to work on your bike for free  gerry has 6 fully equipped stations in the back where he will let you work on your bike for freeany part is available at less than full list prices  it really doesn't get any better than this
1,you're not racing your bicycle this is the shop to go to  $75-150 gets you out the door with a bike if you're willing to do some of the tinkering yourself in the shop  really a one-of-a-kind place and a place i'm really really glad exists  go visit
1,it's true alright though it is cramped and messy and the old dude is grumpy he has a heart of gold and this place is one of the very best like best on earth i always seem to go in frustrated and leave happy this is likely a combination of the fact that i go with a broken bike that leaves fixed and the fact that the cost of fixing is soreasonable i recently replaced my brakes and the ones the old guy gave me were missing a screw so he upgraded me to the next nicer ones for free this guy is really a treasure and this place is too i look forward to the next bike repair because this place is so unabashedly wonderful
1,been in a while (not really a bike nut or even a regular rider) but i have to relate a story to tell you what kind of a place this is i inherited a bike my dad had purchased in college and hard a part break i knew that kraynick's would be the only place able to help even though at the time there were still schwinn "authorized" dealers in the area here's the exchange: me: "i have an old schwinn three-speed probably from 1969 or '70 and it has this little washer with a raised part that fits in the groove between the fork and the rear axle that part broke" him: "a collegiate or a speedster" me (amazed): "speedster" at which point he turned around to a wall of tiny drawers that seemed to stretch from floor to ceiling and appeared to have no intelligible labeling pull open a single drawer and produce the part i needed it cost something like 30 cents places like this pretty much do not exist anymore the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts (and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full) if the recurring rumors of its closing  mr kraynick's retirement are any indication it may not be here forever find any excuse to get here while it's still around
1,bike shop is a diamond in the rough even if the diamond itself seems rough it's messy sometimes and definitely cramped but if you can deal with that it is a great resource for pittsburgh cyclists there are six racks in the back where patrons can work on their bikes and gerry will sell you the necessary parts at discount ratesmany times i've gone in to fix "just one quick thing" and then three hours later i finally leave it can be intimidating if you don't know much about bike mechanics but other people there are usually helpful and friendly and though he doesn't always radiate warmth gerry has helped me with a number of issuesin short a great resource and way to learn a lot and save money if you have the time
1,drunk asshole fell into my back tire and completely ruined it rather then go to trek and spend a good $100 for a new tire and the labor i headed to kraynicksi spent around 3 hours fixing not just my back tire but my shoes shifters and i even cleaned up my chain and gears i love that you go in to fix a simple issue but end up spending hours there you can't help it gerry and john are great people and their willing to help you because they just love what they do rather than to just make a profit i already want to go back and yes best bike shop in existence is a pretty accurate statement
1,spot for weird or obscure parts general maintenance items and to  borrow a wrench or two  gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle   i remember going there for my first time in the early 90's and it hasn't changed in almost 20 years
1,is a real gem for pittsburgh  this isn't the place to take your high-end carbon frame bike but jerry will help you get your commuter beater or frame you found trashed in a ditch in the woods back on the road  (seriously there was a guy in there salvaging an old mtb frame he found in a ditch in the woods)  be forewarned: he's pretty typical of a lot of old school pittsburghers: very gruff at first but actually a nice guy when he warms up to youi haven't had a bike in ten years and decided out of nowhere to build one around an old frame and a new internal gear hub  i bought a few high-end components online and the rest from jerry  despite bringing in outside parts jerry was still gushing with help and after several weeks and 3-4 visits i'm riding a bike that i built from scratch after going in with no mechanical knowledge of bikes at all  he doesn't carry new super-high-end components but the stuff he does carry is solid and he has every weird bracket or screw or cable guide you can imagine from decades of scrounging parts  he can help you with any weird setup you want  (mine's definitely out-of-the-ordinary)one warning: this is your standard old pittsburgh small business so he doesn't take credit cards  it's a little annoying considering that you might be spending over $100 on parts and service but there's an atm down the block
1,i was a little skeptical walking into the place i loved the experience in the end  everything you need or could possibly ever think of needing is there in the shop in multiples  if you don't know what you're looking for or how to fix it gerry will help you  as will the 6 other bike fanatics who are in the shop working on their own bikes  the prices can't be beat  and while you have to do the work yourself it's really rewarding to walk out of there with a bike you fixed yourself  same repairs at rei or dick's would have been two to three times as much  would definitely go back for more
1,love this banana there are always sales and promotions going on so there are always bargains to be had the store is always clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the producti love that there are three floors to explore two for women and one for men the merchandising manager dean has styled the store beautifully i love looking at the styling on the mannequins to get ideas for outfitsthe shoes have drastically improved over the years and i absolutely love the abby flats they are extremely comfortable while still being stylish they get new colors seasonally which makes me a happy girl
1,a former br employee i'm very hard on my shopping experiences at banana republic as a customer however i had a great time shopping here with my husband on saturday we shopped on all 3 floors and received multiple offers for assistance my husband was the focus of the trip and the guys on the men's floor were very helpful they asked what we were shopping for guided us in the right direction and set up a fitting room for him while we were still browsing next time i needwant to shop at banana this will definitely be the store that i head to
1,consider dicks to be by far the best sporting good store in charlotte or the surrounding areas it has pretty much everything from basketball equipment to under armor clothing they also carry things like exercise equipment guns heart monitors weight lifting gear etc etcthey even have a climbing wall (at least the one at south park mall does)
1,went to don's the other day to get my tennis racket re-strung  the store was pretty busy (right after work - 5ish) but don somehow was still able to provide personal service as he always doesyou pretty much can get everything tennis in this store and if don doesn't have it he will most likely order it for you if you want to wait for ityou can either drop your rackets off and come back later to pick them up - most of the time i only have one to string and i just wait for it while browsing at the new products maybe hitting some with the makeshift  hitting cage that don has in the back of the storedon is pretty old school so no creditdebit cards just cash or check  i always make sure i make a pit stop at the atm before i go and see don
1,love don's  don is one of the most charismatic individuals you'll meet and he loves tennis  they have everything from rackets to balls to ball machines to wrist bands to novelty items to grips and dampenersthe list goes onthe best part about this place  they'll have your racket strung the same day i've been coming here ever since  his stringers are pretty good too so don't go to dick's or other sporting goods stores  go to don's
1,bought shoes a sweet 3-compartment insulated head bag grip and had my rackets restrung there several times always satisfied by their professionalism speed and courtesy there's no shoddy salesman tactics no unkept promises about restringing (done same day or next) and i always leave happyi highly recommend don's to all tennis players new and experiencedthanks don's
1,am in the market for an entry-level shotgun for skeet and field birds  heard about this place and thought i would give it a try after work yesterday  i arrived 10 minutes before closing (5:50pm) and was greeted enthusiastically when i walked in  i told the greeter that i was new to the store and to firearms in general  after a quick discussion  about what i was looking for he immediately introduced me to an extraordinarily knowledgeable associate  by the way at 5:50pm on a monday this place was packed  but there seemed to be 30 or more associates working so there was no waiting  since i was new to skeet shooting my person helped me look at different fits and helped me with some shouldering and sighting techniques  the prices seem in-line with what you would find anywhere else  i was not ready to buy that day but i am confident i will buy there when the time is right
1,be clear  i don't own a gun  i'm not into shooting guns or particularly even holding one  (my hands shake and i start feeling nauseous) but i gotta say after being in a few different gun shops for workthis place really takes the cake  i agree with dave s  that hyatt is a very highly respected shop  it's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country  (one of the store employees even printed out the article to show me) you'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls in the casesand all the employees i talked to know their stuff inside and out  i was told the story behind machine guns and the history behind certain handguns  the place is almost always packed (even on black fridaywhen they don't offer any discountssales) and what i admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is  the fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get madnow that's loyalty
1,started attending a defensive pistol shooting club and one of my friends has lent me a gun to use but i need some of the accessories to go with it a proper holster some speed loaders a cleaning kit a trigger lock and a bunch of 'dummy' bullets so that i can safely practice reloading i headed to hyatt because they have everythingthe staff is very helpful and were more than patient to point out where stuff was in the large shop and provide expert recommendations they have a great selection of all of the stuff i wanted but i think that the prices were quite high if you are buying something that can ship in the mail (ie not a gun or live rounds) then you'll want to get it from ebay or one of the sporting supply shops online you'll save a ton
1,selection and don't be fooled by the prices because they haggle and you can get a very competitive deal there if you don't like to haggle then check out their website for their online deals that is where you find the usual rock-bottom pricing for the firearms they carry i'm like a kid in a candy store when i go to hyatt's it's located in the hood but don't let that stop you once inside you will feel very safe as every employee is carrying heat don't have a gun go there don't want a gun good it will be easy to take your food when the zombie apocalypse happens
1, have been doing business with larry and his staff for many years  when i have questions his staff has always made sure i was comfortable with my decisions on new firearms and suppliesthanks larry and the hyatt team
1,below posted about not needing a gun and gave the store a three star rating   sorry sweetheart  you do need a gun and here's why the day  you need one you may not have one  then what i teach firearms and gun safety classes and have had many women lately telling me why they decided to sign up and get a concealed carry permit  they also didn't think they needed a gun until they were assaulted   women are looked on as victims by any perp who wants to control or harm them  a gun is an equalizer  you may never use a  gun for self defense but there might come a day when you need one you won't have one  consider the woman at luby's cafeteria and whom on the one day she didn't have one she lost both her parents due to leaving her gun at home  consider the lying hypocrite gabby giffords who was shot in the head she maybe would have been able to save herself and others  consider the kids at columbine if only one teacher had a gun  consider the washington navy yard   consider amanda collins who recently testified in colorado about being denied the right to carry on campus and ended up being raped  don't think for a moment you don't need one because you live in dilworth  there are still robberies assaults etc that occur there  and please don't blame the gun store or its employees for suggesting a common sense thought  you may come to regret doing so in the future
1,shotgun (870 express) was having trouble getting the last shell to chamber properly  i took it in and on the spot they identified the problem (worn out spring) and had the replacement part in stock  for $10 and 20 min of my time my gun is working properly now  very happy with my experience with hyatt and i will return
1,gun shop should be a lesson to every other business on earth about customer service  every single employee is helpful and friendly  there's none of the elitist attitude that is typical of many gun stores  they're knowledgeable but don't make you feel like a moron  on a practical note i've purchased two firearms here and in both cases prices were better on their online store  you're probably best off buying what you want (if you already know what you want) online then picking it up in store  my most recent purchase was this way and i payed about $100 less online than the price tag said when the guy behind the counter handed it to me  granted i've only bought two guns here but i suspect such will be the case more often than notammo prices reflect the free market  all the ammo i've bought here has been on par with gunbrokercom (i checked on my phone before buying) which i think is the best indicator of market conditions  people complaining about the prices obviously don't understand supply and demand  the demand right now is significantly higher than supply  there are two ways a business can react to that  1) they can take the approach that walmart has and restrict how many boxes each customer can purchase per day (which still leads to shortages as we have seen) or 2) they can raise the price which hyatt and most others have done reasonably in my opinion  yes prices are high and that sucks but with this approach it is still available if you are willing to pay  notice how hyatt has plenty of selection anything you want from what i saw  it's not hyatt's fault that the demand is so high right now (you have the government to thank for that)i've never used their gunsmithing services so i can't speak to themi'll be taking some classes with them soon and given the impressive backgrounds of the guys teaching them i suspect they will be awesomethis is a great great store and i highly recommend it
1,has two extremely strong reasons why you should shop there: selection and service   they have the best selection of firearms east of the mississippi river   and the level of service is unmatched   there are several "experienced" gunsmiths on duty every day and if you need something fixed it can usually be done while you wait  the staff knows firearms and won't bs you  the prices are higher than online however they will accept a reasonable offer   and if you are not happy they will make it right
1,just ordered a knife from their online store  it turns out their picture was wrong and i got the wrong blade  i wrote them and tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid fedex label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no costi'm very satisfied with my experience with them
1,jessie brown's isn't in the most accessible or likely location it is easily one of my favorite places to buy gear and apparel i've been coming here for the past couple of years and have always found items that were difficult to come by deals that couldn't be resisted and always helpful staff though some of the gentlemen tend to have a bit of an attitude they are always willing to help you find what you're looking for the layout and decor is really welcoming and has a great feel these guys have a great selection from different brands north face arcteryx patagonia marmot and some others i also really dig that they have a good selection of climbing shoes and gear their shoe selection is always packed with all different levels of outdoor need i've never purchased one from these guys but they have a killer selection of knives too in the past couple of years i've purchased plenty of msr camp stove canisters from these guys they always have a plethora also picked up a nice thermarest from here most recently my wife and i were looking for a nice mid-layer jacket for the winter for her we checked out a few different options in the women's section and ended up scoring a great deal on a hooded zip from patagonia it was on crazy sale too don't remember exactly how much we ended up paying but i know it was close to 60% off from the previous year if i'm ever looking for something particular jessie brown's always has it or at least something comparable love coming to this local shop
1,is awesome i really like everything about this place the staff is very friendly the food is great the beer selection is good with alot of imports as well as my favorite miller lite:) they make fun of me for ordering miller lite in an irish pub but i get a guinness from time to timeto mix it up  tuesday night pub trivia is alot of fun this is my favorite irish pub in town plus i can avoid the whole strip to get to it too many pubs are in the hotelsmcmullans is a much better option
1,you are looking for a place to meet up with friends then run don't walk to mcmullan's irish pub maybe i was high from winning $50 on bingo earlier that night (huge winnings from someone who usually gambles about $1 per vegas trip on penny slots no less) but i was really taken with this little gem of a place it's such a well-hidden secret that i'm guessing the only the locals go here but once you step inside you will be transported to the emerald isle the pub is run by an irish gent and hey my waitress was irish too so there are some authenticity points i played a show on this particular evening and the crowd was enthusiastic polite and focused on the music (i guess my expectations were that of playing to a bunch of rowdy footballers (so maybe the pub is not that authentic) i sold some cds met some new fans and sat back to watch the headlining band darby o'gill and the little people things got particularly raunchy when they covered "baby it's cold outside" i mean hey they also play a song called "got so drunk i crapped myself" and have an album called "christmas songs for drunken athiests"  so you kind of know what you're in for darby o'gill is the house bandmake sure you get there on a wednesday night to check them out what to order: guiness a veggie burger and mashed potatoes (w a sprig of rosemary)
1,many times have i've been a drunken here more then i've got fingers the atmosphere is small and socialdrink and be merryalso for all those newbies who move here this is a good place to see what locals do especially after work :) oh and check out what they do on the nightly basis i don't participate but it's all gravyand did i mention i've been drunk but no experience bad :)
1,is my four day review of mcmullan's irish pub just to qualify i flew from orlando florida to las vegas just to spend four days in this specific irish pub i may be a bit biasedthe pub has three distinct sections at one end is a bar with video poker machines these are the multi-denominational multi game machines so you have choices the bar also has a lot of promotions such as a free spin for prizes for every four of a kind you hit smoking is permitted in this room - picture old vegas and you get the picture the middle section is more like a traditional irish pub - no gaming and lots of private seating for meals of course the guinness is a proper poor - no sense reviewing an irish pub that can't do that the back is another bar that is mostly for private events and the like it's got a full bar and plenty of room for a decent get togetherthe shepherd's pie is wonderful as is the farmhouse irish breakfast (before you ask - white and black pudding is sausage) the service is great and personable 24 hours a daywe got in at 1:30am christmas morning and headed to mcmullan's right after checking into the hotel a night cap of a couple of guinness while we watched the marathon of a christmas story on tv after catching a few winks we were back again for christmas breakfast of a few more guinness and corned beef hash and eggs - wonderfulwe repeated this similar pattern until the 27th when we came back for a private party the service for our party was fantastic my wife made all of the arrangements and said that brian mcmullan was wonderful to work withall in all i'm pretty stingy with my five star reviews this place is definately worth every star
1,is the first time i've been in an irish pub or have had irish foodand i absolutely love itwe weren't planning on having dinner herewe just saw that there was not wait for a tableso we stepped ini'm not a huge beer drinker but my sisters areand they loved itour waiter even had a thick irish accentso freaking adorablebut the food was absolutely fabulousi had the braised beef and my sisters had the pork tenderloinwe basically licked the platethis will definitely be one of the "have to go to" places in vegas
1,my humble and somewhat besotted opinion the mcmullan family run the single best irish pub in las vegas  unlike the vast majority of bars in town this is not a corporate operation run by mbas from afar  instead the eponymous mcmullans are there every day  furthermore they are extremely involved in the community  their "st baldrick's" charity drive raises donations in six figures for children with cancer every year  mcmullan's pub features all the beverages that you would expect in an irish joint with the food being a definite step above usual bar fare (i'm partial to the fish & chips myself)  however the social experience good music and the "craic" is what you go for here and you get a full heaping serving of it on every visit
1,recently had our wedding reception in the private room at mcmullan's  it was outstanding  the staff was friendly and helpful  the food was delicious  best of all the prices were soooo reasonable  our budget was tiny but we were able to have a full dinner including an open bar for our guestsbrian the owner stopped in to make sure that our party was going well and that everything was to our likingi picked mcmullan's off yelp and i'm sooo glad we didthey went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect including creating a makeshift cake stand for my wedding cakewe had the irish sausage rolls which were phenomenal as well as stuffed mushrooms chicken pot pie and the fish and chips  highly recommend the fish and chipsmy only complaint was that the main entrees weren't served at the same time so people gobbled up the fish and chips in 2 seconds and some people had to wait 10 minutes before the next entree came out  that could have been timed a little better so that everyone could have gotten some of everything instead of it being staggered so muchall in all though i highly highly highly recommend mcmullan's
1,place is freakin' fantastic definitely one of my favorite places to go when in vegas it has atmosphere good food and great brews of all kinds plus if you're a bushmills fan they have the 21 yr on hand
1,was invited to eat here by a cute boy that i had met that same night the irish nachos were tasty the ambience was chill as it was super late in the evening the company amazing five starts no question
1,pie was amazing  fish & chips are pure money and definately start with the warm curry and chips  our waitress was irish which really added to the ambiance  the only caution i give you is that the guinness is as close to fresh as i have tasted this side of the atlantic and they go down very easy  a few nights they have live authentic irish folk music  we went twice in the 4 days we were in vegas
1,a wonderfully positive experience this evening i ordered the irish onion soup along with the buffalo sliders the homemade potato chips are flipping amazing so flavorful other guests in my party ordered the fish and chips perfectly battered along with the grilled chicken mashed and gravy and the cabbage all in all we had a well rounded delicious meal
1,this little place me and my boyfriend go here often the waitresses are great and i appreciate when they remember what we like each time we go always a good band to listen to on the weekends
1,little irish pub in karlsruhe where you can find whichever anglophiles and english-speakers aren't occupying the stools of the bray head (t'other irish pub near durlacher tor)scruffy's has gorgeous dark wood everything from barstools to ceiling beams english-speaking bartenders and british beers on tap and some truly fun music nights with performances from various local bands i've had a really nice time every time i've been there
1,authentic irish pub the place is dark crowded and you need to grab the drinks yourself rustic wooden tables and benchesenjoy an irish beer cider or whiskey there live music is also part of the deal (not everyday though)
1,been to mccarold's several times and will definitely be back several times more they have a great beer and scotch selection  and the atmosphere is always friendly and chilltheir kitchen also makes great pub food: make sure you try their onion rings they have tvs but they're on only when the habs are playing which is great (i typically dislike tvs at bars)only drawback is that you need to remember it is cash only
1,coming here to watch a game of football or basketball they have football food specials there happy hour is half off on pizzas and drinks if you like a ruben try the sean patrick's signature pizza amazing also try the sean patrick's chips it's their take on nachos all their burgers are well cooked and have awesome flavor they opened up a new cigar lounge next to the pool table and shuffle board its the only pt's bar with a cigar lounge it's has comfortable seating two big screen tvs and 3 humidors filled with cigars gets busy during a football game so come early to grab seating in therewill always recommend sean patricks
1,the most unique night life experience that charlotte has to offerif you don't like 80's music or similarly don't have any sense of humor or humility this place isn't for you  there are dozens of meat market dance clubs available in the uptown area  however if you're looking for a place to get drunk and dance to micheal jackson hits or sip a beer and watch replays from 80's dunk competitions this place is going to thrill you  most important the vibe here is unlike any dance club i've been to  you're far more likely to see a sid vicious look-alike or a break dancing session form in the middle of the floor than you are to see a shoving match or a fight break out  80's music has a way of draining the aggression from testosterone pumped drunkards  and that provides for the most enjoyable dancing experience i've had in charlotteeveryone looks ridiculous when they dance to 80's music  so if you're accustomed (like i am) of looking ridiculous when you dance you'll love the breakfast club
1,better know what you're getting into which is totally awesome 80s and cheap ass drinks away from the frattiness of uptown don't be scared it's a blast
1,lunch spot  their cubano sandwiches are excellentand always go with the friesskinny perfectly made fries  their mojitos and caipirinhas are the very best in towndinner seemed a bit overpriced but the food is still excellent  the other nice part of latorres is that its in the heart of downtown so plan a nice dinner or happy hour before heading out to hit some more classic bars pubs or clubs in charlotte
1,yum yum latorre's is one of my favorite lunch spots and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been  my personal fave is the pollo chipotle sandwich with skinny fries  their food is amazing and the prices aren't too bad eitheri have a slight issue with latorre's and here it is:  once upon a time i asked for the cubano sandwich but with no mustard  well mr waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way  hmmpre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  i'm a skeptic  after asking around i found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are not pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush  my point:  the next time you want your cubano with no mustard or extra sauce don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you  by the way my spy happens to be an employee so i know it's true  all in all this place is great
1,food is good but to me the desserts are what really make latorre's special they do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magicalthey have great lunch specials it's a little pricey for just me but it's just right for a business lunch with a client it makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and funthere's lots of vegetarian options which is always a good thing everything is presented beautifully which is always fun some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat salsa night is also a good time the crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself i've honestly never had a bad time here night or day charlotte needs more places with so much character
1,favorite venue in cuaffordable ticketsexcellent soundeasy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the "center" wall and cheap drinkshaving been to venues all over the midwest i always find myself wanting to be at the highdive for a show  especially considering a show or tour that would sell-out in chicago might just reach capacity down in champaignhow i miss it
1,never been here for a showwell let me clarifyi used to come here tons as an undergrad for various asian parties and i still come here most times i've visited as an undergrad  things usually devolve into a shit showwhich honestly is a good thing and it's what i'm shooting for when i want to forget about the real world for a weekend  sure it's off campus but it does have a giant dance floorstage and some awesome people behind the bar last time i was here i just kept asking for either a) something awesome or b) something alcoholic  never was disappointed onceif anyone you know is planning a party at the hd be sure to clear your schedule and hit it up you won't regret it (and you might not remember it)
1,been yearsbut i loved going to shows here while i attended isu  very intimate venue to see your fave bands play with good food and libations
1,and my main yelper came from indianapolis to watch corb lund play at the highdive  it's an intimate concert venuebar and we had a great time  parking was a breeze we found plenty of spaces on a saturday night right in front of the venueif you're coming to a show get there early to snag seating  we found great seats up in balcony which had it's own bar  were the bar stools and benches comfortable  hell no  not at all but the awesome drink prices made up for the sore buns  maybe it's because i'm used to paying upwards of $8 for a mixed drink but $450 wild turkey mixers made for a great night  service was quick and i never had to wait around at the bar to get a drink which was niceall in all a great place to grab a cheap drink and listen to some live music
1,this is your quintessential small town concert venue  great prices great service great music  i came from way out of town for an act that i couldn't pass up: the corb lund band  canadian honky-tonk at its finest  what i like most was the vibes - this place has character  you can tell the building is old but from what it looks like it is in great condition  the mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist  i like it  if it's open try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony especially if seats are limited down below  the view and sound is fantasticticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that i saw are under $20 most well below that  corb was $15 and from the performance we got i'd say it was well worth it  what also blew me away was the drink prices i got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5  maybe i'm not used to small town prices but this was an unexpected surpriseall towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like the highdive  i have to agree with jess s on her review; there are not many places like this in the midwest and surely not in indy  keep booking the gigs highdive i'll keep ordering wild turkey and ginger ales
1,bar is pure vintage  chester street is where my club life began  i spent the good majority of my nights (between the ages of 19 - 22) at chester street  it is still my all-time favorite club to this day as far as atmosphere music and engineering  the dance floor is massive with a giant mirror in the back  there are speakers to dance upon (or used to be) which is an added bonus  the bars are offset from the dance floor which alleviates any added congestion (like i see too frequently at the stl bars)  it was extremely economical at the time - i think cover was maybe $2 on the hoppin' nights and you could easily drink yourself stupid for $20-30  it was a hell of a lot of fun and i am in the process of actually planning a trip back soonlong over due  cu is a fun town period  c street is a nice little gem snug in the middle of the city where people can be themselves & dance the night away to the best clubhouse beats
1,is this magical place you call c street i used to be afraid of this place as a closed-minded junior "it's too far i won't like the crowd" i told myself (read: i'm a straight male) but i gave it a shot one day and wow c street has the best dj's and dance floor onnear campus you can truly dance like a dying flounder and it's totally acceptable (at least late enough in the night) from what i hear from my friends who are girls they really enjoy it because there aren't guys constantly trying to dry hump them into oblivion if you want to let loose and get a good leg workout go to c street with a group of friends and let the music take controlps yeah there are still the creepers who hang at the bar and there is typically cover on the weekends but it is still exponentially better than any other dance bar in cu
1,only bar with a $3-$5 cover depending on the night i'm a fan of the drag shows every sunday night
1,stars for the drunk females and 1 star for the place being so small lol ;p it's 21 and over on the second floor and below it's 18+ they don't serve alcohol at the bottom
1,place is awesome i usually get the vip on the second floor service is always great people are always friendly and there is always something happening there from foam parties to all dressed in white events i would definitely recommend checking it out if you want to have an amazing time down town phx
1,on the transylvania night 3rd friday of the month was excellent stunning club bar staff great plus djs were good and you could get requests too  played good mix
1,the word from a trusted friend who recently went:verylatinit was yummy and funawesome musicfun dancinggood crowdon a scale of 1-1011
1,first time i went to karamba's it was for pride i went for after hours and it was amazing i paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar there were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom when we went deeper into the club the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor there were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section the dance floor was packed with men grinding up on men with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace there's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor then there's the outside patio there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs benches and tables sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at since that weekend i've been a regular there i'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some friday or saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around if you do pull me away from my friends and say hi hope to see ya'll there
1,music and tons of fun love the music fridays is mainly for "cheros" akaguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music notreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going saturdays is hip hopreggaeton and house music which is the main day it gets popin  after 2 it turns 18and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it note: karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind ofplace  it kind of reminds me of a club i used to go to in juarez except with alot moreeye candy  the atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle itsmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impressanyone  from experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its truebathrooms: yea they're kinda small but um im there to party if your worried about thebathrooms lmao please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you  prices: people say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap if yourhard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute latino will buy your drinks for u duh
1,doesn't matter what anybody says about dance night clubs you have to see for yourself because this club is absolutely incredible they have an amazing sound system and laser light this is definitely where i would want to be on the weekend if i'm looking for a dance club this club is so good it has received the best of phoenix award several years in a roll none of the latino dance clubs have survived only this club because the owner knows what he's doing and provides great music and entertainment you have to go stop in and see this place if you're looking for a latino club this is really the only place in arizona to go  also the club has a food taco stand outside which is good and also an amazing outdoor patio that's absolutely beautiful it also has there are areas in the club that are sort of tucked away where you can sit with friends and drink and have a really great time i am lmao at all these little young tweakers who are posting bad reviews because they had a bad time give me break they have no clue what a really good dance club is all about and their one time bad experience has nothing to do with the quality of a club maybe if they weren't so high they could have enjoyed the club lol
1,am a bit partial to this bar our band (screaming ant) plays there all the time the bar it'self  has been around along time and shows it's age but what's inside are the nicest folks i ever ran across in my life  it has pool large tv's for sport games live musicthe entertainment draws from some of the best rock  bands in the valley and brings some good ole rock and roll that you you just don't find anywhere elsenow  besides the playing there i have no relations with anyone in the place and all i know is that when i ask the owner if i could use the bar for an event to raise money for my sister who has been diagnosed with cancer with out a blink of an he said yes and they have been great help at helping me organize the eventthe bar has a huge parking lot and easy accessthe bartender and waitresses or really on their game  i remembered as i left the place that i was really happy and i wanted to go back when we get gigs there our band get's excited that is because the crowds are fun and it seems like we make new friends everything we play
1,your student id for discountsinstead of paying 92 bucks at fred astaire this is a cheap alternate cheap optionof course its not as technical and personal as fred astaire but i'm saying $ value-wisethere are beginner group lessons (i think it was every friday 7 pm its been a while)followed by intermediate group lessonsi think i paid around 10 bucks or belowthen the floor is open for all sorts of dancesgreat way to have fun practice and learn new stuffthere are refreshments too which is awesome : )
1,have taken several group lessons on tuesday evenings for west coast swing instructor robert campos is one of the best wcs instructors in the valley his instruction is clear and he demonstrates great ability at handling large crowds his classes are very popular so expect large crowds getting personal attention can be problematic but fortunately robert has an assistant to help people partners are rotated often so expect to meet lots of other people who love to dance there is a meat market aspect to these large group classes but i always enjoy the opportunities to meet beautiful ladies after rotating to dozens of partners it's easy to break the ice to get them onto the dance floorafter most of the group lessons paragon keeps the floor open for several hours the music and dancing is always good i like the dance afterwards to practice what i learned in the group lesson  friday night is the best ballroom party in the valley they start by giving a group lesson in a different ballroom style every week the lessons are excellent quality once the lessons are over the large floor is devoted to ballroom and the smaller one to west coast swing snacks are served and dances last until midnight the east valley is very lucky to have a studio like paragon sometimes i feel i spend more time there than i do at home
1,came here for the first time and didn't know what to expect it turned out to be a lot of fun first (we went on a friday) it's $7 cash at the door to get in at 7:30 the dance lesson beganor was supposed to (it started more around 7:45) the lesson of the night was west coast swing apparently they teach different genres of dance every week you need to check their website to see what they are offering for that week they split off the beginners from the intermediateadvance dancers us beginners were put in a smaller dance room studio (to my releif as i have never danced west coast swing and was nervous to be in front of advanced students)after an hour of class (which goes by very fast) they have an open dance floor until midnight most of the people there are people who simply love dance they switch up the music to a different genre for every song ie waltz foxtrot salsa rumba swingetc even if you are not a great dancer or only know one genre of dance it's certainly fun to watch everyone there are some really good pros and amateurs no one really cares what you look like out there everyone is just there to dance (there were people there of many age groups as wellfrom early 20's to 60's or 70's)i love that you can just drop in for a class no sign up or commitment necessary i'm looking forward to dropping in again soon
1,place was delicious  my parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebak's "25 things i like about pittsburgh" and he's usually pretty accurate  his recommendations were to try the reuben fish sandwich and open-faced steak sandwich  we went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a saturday) and were seated right away  the staff is extremely friendly  my mom & i each had the fish sandwich while my dad & brother had a reuben sandwich  the fish was very good but the reuben was to die for  both dishes were massive and could very easily be shared between two people  on top of being extremely large portions it was incredibly affordable  the giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant reuben was $750  our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal  we will definitely be back  oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take cash only  so come prepared but i'm pretty sure i saw an atm there as well  and i do believe they are closed on sundays & mondays
1,miss stop for the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh
1,place should have a lot more reviews - but i'm glad it doesn't they don't need to get any busierits been there ages and looks it if you're all about ambiance don't bother if you pretend you're in a movie set in pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well the service is sometimes hit or miss most of girls are good one is very slow one is amazing they are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food the food is awesome worth any little complaints i might think up before it gets there once its on the table i forget them all-fish sandwiich-salmon (huge and delicious)-flounder-shrimp a few ways ("norfolk" style is oily for my taste and i never had it growing up in norfolk)-hawkins st special-prime rib (sized for two watch it)the prices are low the portions are large and just about everything on the menu  is delicious i'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste this place is a gem
1,schooltraditional "mom 'n pop" quality and perfection the best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp a great out of the way non-corporate vestige of americana you will love it
1,this restaurant on 25 best places in pittsburgh with rick sebackack went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner she's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty

1,a morning of thrift store hunting a friend and i were thinking of lunch and he suggested emil's after he'd seen chris sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before and i had not he said they had a decent reuben but to be prepared to step back in timewell seeing as how i'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's and the whole rat pack scene stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burghas long as it doesn't involve 1979 which i can see all around me every dayand yet another shot at finding a decent reuben in da burghwell that's like hunting the holy grail so looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurtso off we go right at lunchtime in the middle ofwhere exactly were we at first i thought we were lost driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway and thenaha here it is and yep there it was this little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'emil's we walked in the front door and entered another world another time and another place oh and any big burritosousa foodies might as well stop reading now i wouldn't want to see you walk in roll your eyes and say 'reaaaaaalllly'this is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets plain with a dark wood bar on one side plain white walls with no yinzer pics good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables this is the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pulling a few tables together for some poker a fish sammich and some cheap scotch and that is exactly what i loveohbut good food counts too we each had a reuben and my friend had a side of fries the reubens were decent but not ny awesome a little too thick on the bread but overall tasty and definitely filling not too skimpy on the meat i seriously crave a true good ny reuben but since i can't afford to travel right now what i find in da burgh will have to do but as we sat and ate burgers came out to an adjoining table those were some big thick burgers a steak went past for the table behind us that was huge and when we asked about it the waitress said 'yeah it's huge and really good and he only charges $1299 for it ain't that nuts' another table of five came in and wham fish sandwiches piled with breaded fish that looked amazing yeah i want that that that and thatmy friend also mentioned that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that is only served until 4 pm and that it is fantastic if only i could get there on that week day before 4the waitress did a good job especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a saturday and only one of her she kept up and was very friendly they only have pepsi products so i had a brewed iced tea which was very fresh and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could as the lunch hour went on they were getting busyemil's is no frills good portions very reasonable prices very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wallkind of like cheers but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's fan-freakin-tastic i could feel at home hereyou definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though i am not sure that i could find it again on my ownit really is a hidden gem i will be making my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it isaddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich excellent truly a pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun) the fish was flavorful the batter excellent and for just $8 this may have been the best fish sandwich i've yet to have in da burgh
1,food here can actually be a little hit and miss but i love the grilled cheese club with fries i get it way too much people make fun of methey have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards fyi
1,wings and pubgrub great beer selection and fun bartenders
1,owneris the man  he's a true pittsburgher and he loves everyone from pittsburgh  he looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart  look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friendshe'll hook you up  he's also totally into the development of other pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups  ask him for a tour of the old eat n park next doori believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts  fortunately the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghettothe crowd is certainly decent  definitely have some beers on the porch in the summerespecially in the rain (lower level is covered)  very relaxing atmosphere  i wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent dukes more steadily (we're on the north side)  still worth the drive to feel at home have a good bite and some cold beers
1,burger night on tuesday add ons more
1,of my favorite places and they have thee best lemon drop martini's plus the bar tender looks like clark kent(superman) very handsome guy
1,atmosphere and rather humble especially for a chain restaurant the service is always friendly even if they are busy i enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu i highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too
1,location  i love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread  love love love the smiley cookies :)
1,crab bisque in uskept going back daily while in p town getting giant cup of itwowits unbelievable
1,came here with a party of 40 very hungry pitt students the food was amazing we had roasted beef chicken and pasta the management was lovely and really involved during any party issues the staff was also very kind and able to keep everyone's glass full despite our camel like drinking habits thank you
1,came here with a friend before a show at stage ae and had a great dinner their steak is terrific as are their bbq pork quesadillas desserts are all amazing too (i recommend the peanut butter mousse) we've been to 3 atria's so far and they've all been good but this was the best cool decor and great service too
1,is my favorite place to grab a drink andor a snack before a ball game great staff and a large bar make this place perfect to meet friends and the beer is way cheaper than beer in the park
1,for the mcg holiday jazz event and this place exceeded my expectations on all levels -- food service ambience and entertainmentfood:  we ordered a small cheese platter  the chef actually came out and explained the cheeses on our plate  nice touch though i have to admit to not necessarily knowing which cheese went with which explanation  nonetheless all were quite tasty and better than i would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be  i ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin the novemberfest special which was also tasty from the bite i acquired from him as were the squash bites i "stole"  service:  greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right away despite being very early for our reservations  offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed but not pushy when we weren't in needambience:  we sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage  cozy quaint warm feel to it  nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able to carry on a quiet conversationentertainment:  i've been trying to like jazz for awhile now and not all that successfully  last night was a winner for jazz band quality and for the vocalist's quality  very nice indeed
1,is me n mumz' second time here for thanksgiving and they always make us feel like we've come home to family for the holidayswonderful service and nice atmosphere for a holiday meal speaking of which the food is like homemade too the smells and football on the tv's makes u feel at home free parking out front; not too shabby

1,can't go wrong with cain's the staff is friendly and the food is great i'm a regular guest and i've never been disappointed i highly recommend it
1,my momhusband and i had dinner there yesterday from a ad in the paper with valentine's specials for the whole month of february we ordered the surf and turf special it started with a salad i had their classic which was huge and super delish  the classic salad was a generous amount of spring mixtomatocucumberpurple onionpeppercini   they have so many salad dressing choices not your ordinary blahzay boring choices the spinach salad was also amazing spinach walnutsfetacranberries the caesar is what you would expect generous portion but averagethen a soup choice of french onion or soup de jour  (soup of the day) my husband had the french onion wow he said it was prepared perfect and how french onion should be served a nice crock full and nice amount of cheese covering and balance of bread and soup my mom and i had the soup of the day which was a roasted red pepper mushroom soup this was a soup we had never experienced and boy was it fabbie definitely a soup we shall enjoy againnow the main coursea 6 oz filet mignon and 4-5 oz lobster tail  twice baked potato fresh white asparagus the steak was cooked perfect my mom and i ordered med rare my husband ordered his med and there was not an issue with eitherif all this wasn't enough choice of homemade desserts  was carrot cake    or brownie a la modewe all chose the brownie a la mode it was huge the brownie was like a 4x4 brownie with a huge scoop of ice cream service was excellent our waitress was on top of things couldn't ask for better what an amazing establishment  a true hidden gem  all of this for 1999 
1,far the best bar i have been to while i stayed at my sisters for my vacay all i have to say is the waitress that helped me rocks  and the bartender that helped me yesterday rocks too thanks for the fire cracker drink it was awesome i hope this gets to them i really do
1,wasn't expecting much but they surely over delivered  i thought it was just another bar  it had the bar vibe  i didn't think the food would be this good  i am impressed that most of the food is made in-house  i actually don't remember what i got since it was several weeks ago that i went  all i know was that the food was much better than any bar food i had  i would come here again
1,fun place the place is always busy the servers are attentive and the food is delicious the wings are cooked perfectly it's your true pittsburgh bar with seating for dinner in the back
1,local bar with lots of tvs good draft selection and better than average bar food definitely a step up from the saloon
1,can't review the service because i ordered take out but oh my goodness my food i ordered the fried chicken and i can honestly say that i've never picked apart chicken like that before my only complaint is that there wasn't enough it was juicy inside and so crispy on the outside the fries that came along with the chicken were decent but the fried chicken outshines them so much it came with coleslaw as well but it wasn't anything special standard coleslaw mix anything that was wrong with the rest of the food i received was immediately forgiven when i started eating the chicken i also got the cheese sticks which are never a disappointment i can't stop raving about the chicken though go eat cain's fried chicken now
1,wife and i wanted to try cain's after we got a yelp email around halloween that highlighted the best bloody mary's in pittsburgh we bookmarked the places and figured eventually we'd hit them all i called on a wednesday in february one afternoon asking what time they served breakfast on sunday's my wife and i were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics when i called i didn't see the yelp page that mentioned no reservations so i asked anyway i spoke to joe demarco(sp) who was awesome when i told joey that we wouldn't be able to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me not to worry and that they'd make an exception for us when we arrived on sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us the food was fantastic i got the harvest benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered in hollandaise) as a vegeterian i like to see stuff like this on the menu creative veggie fare the homefries were crispy and well done and the hollandaise was rich and creamy the bloody mary bar was a pretty cool idea as well we had 2 each and enjoyed switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives the wait staff was super friendly and extremely kind when we got our bill we were told that joey had gotten our first round of drinks way to go cain's you delivered a solid meal excellent service and a great atmosphere we'll definitely bring friends here and come back soon
1,was fortunate enough to find this restaurant for a delicious lunch while traveling in the area  i went off and performed my seminar then decided to return for a late supper i sat at the bar and was served by a young woman whom i had assumed was the owner based on her superb professional demeanor she informed me she was a 'very new' server  wow araci's hold on to this gem  as it was late i decided to create my own supper from various appetizers one was better than the next by the way but i also wanted to point out that this 'very new' server had such a unique way of suggesting additional culinary delights even this seasoned traveler was hooked and glad he was everything she suggested was perfect  my only regret is i don't live closer to pittsburgh so i might be able to return
1,had a bad meal
1,really like soho  first off it's located on the north shore and close to everything  nice bar friendly staff sleek and modern  great place to watch a game lcd screens everywhere  skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp  they do a really good job with a filet mignon  the salmon picata looked yummy but since it wasn't mine i didn't get to taste it  if you don't want a big meal they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers  for dessert have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake  or if you're not feeling fancy just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger  it's that kind of place too
1,love it here  great game day event location  great meeting  huge bar  huge selection  not just bar food  so you will enjoy a dinner   if you have the munchies it will hit the spot   ok do let's do it  have some fun
1,not the closest kings to us but we often will travel the extra miles because the service and food at this location is always the best
1,to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh  first time go with a friend and sit at the counter  short order cooking at it's best it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you  breakfast has no losers  eggs omelets pancakes waffles breakfast sandwiches to order the ever popular mixed grill get a 12 louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toastfrequently voted the best burger in pittsburgh for a reason  as for ambiance well lets just say i don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint  but the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good andlocal with many long time folks working here  if i don't get there for awhile i need to go through detox because i feel too healthy
1,unpretentious and for this one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country  simply put i love it here  the mixed grill the sausage and egg on a biscuit the home fries  this it the very definition of diner  thank you gab 'n' eat
1,let's first set expectations  this place is a true divethis is not for the nyc foodie crowd  if you want a down home large portion awesome breakfast this is the place  the place is packed with happy diners the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way  the best part - they have "dippy" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order  for anyone who has never heard of a "dippy" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them  the eggs were great - i ordered mine over medium the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh italian bread  yum
1,lived in pittsburgh for 6 years and in carnegie for over 2 years and by far this is the best greasy spoon joint i've found if you can stomach the wait (no reservations naturally) you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made here are the highlights:-cheap: breakfast for two can be well under $10 with lunch around the same-crowded: get there early and expect to wait they close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly at 12:45pm)-cash only-huge portions: when ordering fries or homefries always get the half order unless you're a lumberjack-about those homefries: they're often undercooked i've had better believe me my favorite things to eat in life are potato products-my favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick italian toast with cheese lettuce tomato and mayo
1,this place  never had a bad meal  good portions and great people  be ready to stand in line
1,favorite breakfast place  have good sandwiches also  stopped again for bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real man  mixed grill has sausage (could it be ricci's) eggs onions and home fries soooo goooooooood  use mancini's bread for toast got the raisin toast - yum  have had many other items and just love the food  if you like to watch a true cook sit at the counter  banter with the cook and staff and patrons is funlunch is good sausage sandwich hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grillgets busy for bfast so you may have to waitremember it is a diner  don't expect fancy decor
1,breakfast place come hungry look for dick my dad and gino at the counter every am about 0830 and say hi try the mixed grill (half)
1,diner in the counrty we've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  gab and eat the best rating  i was a little intimidated when i first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill  if you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you but everything i ate was clearly the opposite of healthy  after trying like every meal they have i would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast  burgers are great tooit's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home but this place does it  the atmosphere is classy old school americana
1,french toast ever love the friendly atmosphere and especially the breakfast never been disappointed you have to try french toast with raisin bread too yummy
1,diner  their breakfast is the best in the area  lots of  choices and always good  love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall  get there early otherwise you will not get a seat  they have homemade hotsweet sausage and texas toast
1,love their stakes and i come here every week just to get the t bone steak it is completely delicious great atmosphere there is always a lot people and the waiters are nice; food portion is great as well
1,time with hubby after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal waitress was such an adorable girl her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great jobstrawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) strawberry milkshake nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop orderingits always nice when u go late at night like us it is not crowded not noisy nice music playing and always nice people around if you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say denny's
1,location never disappoints food is always consistently great and if you come at the right time (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back and it is awesome  love this place
1,location  i love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread  love love love the smiley cookies :)
1,a random sunday morning i went in search of a good breakfast spot  i decided to explore the mckees rocks neighborhood and came upon marge's place  i hadn't heard much about this place but after reading the few reviews i could find i decided to give it a try  inside it's bigger than i expected but still has that down home diner feel  my guess is that most of the people there were regulars  the wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me someone they had never seen before  i picked a table in the corner so i could observe what i imagine was a typical sunday morning  i ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon potatoes and toast  any place that has mancini's italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book  being in mckees rocks though they really don't have a choice  the potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful  the only way i can think of to describe the bacon isporkier  is that even a word  i just don't know how else to descibe it  the combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5)  one random note: i liked the tables and chairs  they were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating  good distance between the table and chairs  that may sound silly and i thought so too at first  but when i go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow it can hinder my enjoyment  not only will i return but i will also recommend marge's place to anyone in the area  it was a surprisingly good find  i like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong
1,small town breakfast spot highly recommend george's mixed grill  delicious
1,have live around this area all my life and my family would go here and i would always decline to go that is until saturday my brother asked me if i wanted to go to breakfast and i had to say yes (just posted on facebook that i wanted to go to breakfast and nobody wanted to go with me) lets get to the review i am glad i said yes there homefries are awesome the eggs were just right i would definitely go here again
1,new to pittsburgh so i wanted to try out all the local spots first and let me tell you this spot is definitely worth a try it's a cute diner with a lot of local charm the prices are awesome and the food is even better i had the cinnamon raisin french toast with the home fries and a coffee all of it was really good i'm not a complainer but i'm picky and honestlyi have nothing but good things to say about this place i highly recommend you stop by and give it a try you can thank me later ;)
1,service friendly staff great food great prices what more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place will definitely be back
1,love this place normally it would have been 45 stars but since they moved to a smoke free environment it gets a 5 star rating the staff is quick friendly and very "with it" this is a true family business and the food is fantastic i love the jumbot it's amazing and hearty the coffee isn't the best but the food makes up for it the french toast and pancakes are lovely too this is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are generous with the butter i like this place way better than pamelas which apart from the strawberry crepes doesn't really do it for me it was recently on the food network too so i'm not the only one that feels that way
1,start with the conclusion - this place is the very best breakfast diner in pittsburgh  why  in very large part because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily  this includes the ham which the restaurant roasts every morning complete with their own glaze  the ham is cut from the bone to order absolutely succulent with a hint of clove  the ham alone is reason enough to visit this place but that isn't even the best offeringfirst are the pancakes which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes i've ever eaten  the batter is prepared fresh every morning  they have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center  the apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that i don't even eat them with syrup lest i mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon cream vanilla and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure  seriously these pancakes are damn goodsecond all the egg entrees are fabulous  try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham fresh cut from the bone piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted italian bread topped with sunny-side-up eggs and freshly prepared hollandaise  fantastic  the omelets are great and the "jumbot" - an "everything in the prep table" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of dinersthe food here is really top-notch  i realize that it's just a diner but when i see and taste food this good and this lovingly prepared i want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food  with that in mind i'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation "table syrup" stuff that i've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles  i'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes  also i'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb) gravy  i'd *crawl* to the dor-stop from my home to eat therethis place is packed on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early  the wait however will be worth it  i eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast
1,this this morning and i am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here awesome food fresh and the staff was even better won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg gotta get here
1, hands down the best pancakes i have ever put in my mouth sometimes i day dream about dor stop pancakes  too bad i live 6 hours away or i'd go there everyday  the service was just ok but the place was packed and the food was well worth the wait
1,breakfast was absolutely phenomenal i specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes they did not disappoint i tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck i even promised some things i should be ashamed of lol i would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here
1,dor-stop restaurant has an enchanting old fashioned look inside and out that effectively conveys its main appeal: good simple cooking at reasonable prices the menu has typical diner favorites i ordered the ham off the bone breakfast (with their special ham potato pancakes eggs and toast) and true to form it was very good (ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle) and was reasonably priced at about $7   i went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full so i didn't have to wait food came quickly and service was good (even though the young waitress oddly addressed me as "honey" every time)  as i was finishing up an older gentleman seemingly a "regular" came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff he took a seat at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him (he ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus a bowl of soup) and he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed his lunch i'm guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great place this is and keep coming back
1,had no idea that this restaurant was "legendary" when i decided to eat there this morning with my family  i was severely hungover and just needed some grease and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this placethe restaurant is "cozy" (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill the restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe despite it being *packed* we were seated right awaythe menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options i ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries my husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals the food was simple enough but amazingly delicious i think they battered the onion rings in crack i also ordered an orange juice which i could tell was fresh squeezedthe portion sizes were reasonable too not gigantic which i appreciate i finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman i think i'll look for reasons to come to pittsburgh now that i know this restaurant exists yum
1,you ever need an explanation of what a bottomless cup of coffee truly signifies check out the dor-stopin addition to that lesson the you will experience the following:-hotcakes so good you don't need to add syrup (mine were oatmeal raisin like eating the amazing hybrid of a cookie and pancake)-potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders-slabs of ham so goodadd in the great service ease to find parking and decent prices and this place is truly a gem don't let the wait scare you unless you have a large group - people flow out of there pretty quickly and for 2 people on a sunday we only had to wait 10 minutes (and they gave us free samples while we waited) and it is definitely worth the wait
1,many others before me i came to the dor-stop with high expectations and let me tell you my expectations were exceededmy girlfriend and i have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the dor-stop has always been high on my list to trythe place is classic still has a bar counter kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant the place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 34 full before it was refillednow lets get to the nitty gritty: the foodi got the pancake breakfast usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came i was so impressed the hotcakes are so different some would even say magical they are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon i almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito my mouth is watering thinking about itmy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done their ham is so succulent and tender they cut it off the bone at the dor-stop and is shows the sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich i have ever seen i recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes they are the best in the cityoh and try the potato pancakes they will rock your world
1,called on memorial day and said "i was just checking if you're open today" "no" she snapped "we're closed ya jest woke me up" well with customer service like that i knew this had to be a real dinerand boy oh boy was i right hotcakes thick and soft as fresh cookies something called "jumbot" (which seems to be pittsburghese for "whatever we scraped off the grill" but boy is it good) and good luck finding the bottom of a cup of coffee because they'll never let you get low enough to see itmaybe these aren't the hugest pancakes in town (that honor goes to the mancakes at eggs-r-us in crafton) but they sure are delicious well worth a few minutes' wait for a table
1,fast the prices are fantastic it's the definition of town diner can't wait to come back and try everything else also they have grits that's all i needed to know
1,have ate at some awesome places and nothing compares to the food here its top notch and an awesome price at that my mate and i go like 5 times a week and the people are awesome especially mama roslyn she makes our day every time we get see her she will put a smile on your face and make u feel like she has known you your whole life
1,of the best places i've been too in all of pittsburgh fantastic food and lovely people
1,place has more heart than a cardiac surgeon's office and more personality than the meyers briggs test ba dum dumbut in all seriousness that's what makes this a five star review rather than a four mama ros runs the shop along with her life love mike and she and he will treat you as one of their own kids (but you know in like a warm life-affirming way rather than creepy)saying that they're not in it for the money would be an understatement the food is great diner breakfastlunch fare at extremely reasonable prices (and by "extremely reasonable" i mean that it's freaking cheap) mama ros and mike really just want to feed you they give food to the homeless and every thanksgiving they host a huge donation-based thanksgiving dinner for all those who can't afford throwing a feast themselves or who can't be with their families during the holiday (or who would rather avoid being with their families in favor of the awesome thanksgiving party that is mama ros's turkey dinner)great food a business that's truly for the community and a home away from home experience place puts a smile on my face every time
1,food fast service great price the local friendly atmosphere is everything you love in a place like this not the best looking atmosphere but you can not beat the friendly staff my goto quick bite place in bloomfield
1,you are looking for a place that has high class  decor this place is definitely not for you at all  if you want a real down to earth place without any fakeness this is definitely the place for you  this is a very tiny place that hold 18 people inside (plus two table on the outside)i love this place   the food is greatthe food is to die for  mama r will make anything you want even though it may not be on the  menu  the portions are very generous  the place is owned by two awesome people (mike and ros)  they are definitely from the 60s era  don't let the employees scare you away  they are all super nice peoplethey have body piercings and tatoos every where  immediately after walkingin i felt so comfortable thanks ross for an awesome breakfastps this place only take cash
1,awesome awesome lady  she will make your food the way you want it  she is such a sweet kind compassionate person  the food portions are large  definitely worth the price  i am not a breakfast person but here i am   i love the 60's hippy look that this place has  mike and ros are definitely two of the nice people on earth  ros will make your meal the way you wantthe portions are beyond hugethis is a tiny place that seats 18 insideon nice days there are two tables outsidedon't let the workers with all their many body piercings and freakin' awesome tattoos and awesome hair turn you away  they are the sweetest staff that i have ever met  i get the best service here  more so  than any 4 or 5 star dining place
1,try never to miss at least going once a weekend  best breakfast in the 'burgh
1,was looking for a quick bite after an early morning work out and took a chance based on the yelp reviews this place is a gem "mom" is a typical short order chef with years of experience under her belt the food was hot fresh and simple and the coffee was surprisingly good even though it is clearly a locals place (four people came and went whose food came without ordering it) the owner couple were welcoming and chatty i heard all about their thanksgiving they were closed thursday and friday to serve or deliver 300 meals to the needy in their community 130 deliveries and others picked up the community supports them financially but they cooked for nearly two weeks to make it happen 100% gratuity well deserved keep it up mom
1,a cheap breakfast served to you by people that treat you like family as soon as you come in the door this is your spotthe food is solid dinner food you will get a good meal at an excellent price and probably a hug the place is small so if they are busy be prepared to stand and waitit is what it is a quirky place to grab a meal run by a really nice couplei would be remiss to review this place and not mention the free thanksgiving meal the sandwich shop does for those that have no place to go can't afford it or are shut in
1,love bruegger's i'm a member of their "bottomless mug club" which costs about $150 for the year and entitles me to unlimited free beverages for a year many times your receipt includes a survey to get a dollar-off couponprepared bagels and sandwiches are a bit pricey but there are a lot of coupons and promotions available the "last night's bagels" are a great deal and if toasted taste almost fresh
1,a doubt one of the nicest places i have ever had the pleasure of laying my headhaving wine and cheeseor breakfastingthe inn on negley is gorgeously appointed  the individual rooms all named for varieties of apple are spectacular  we were in the lovely northern spy  the bed was wonderfully comfortable the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious  l'occitane bath products smelled divine  the shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the pittsburgh doingsbreakfast each morning cooked by the hospitable chef jackie is pure pleasure  each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning what time you'll be eating and drop it off in the dining room  the next day jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate the pastry of the day and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee  omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs  irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery  toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious  breakfast meats are lean and filling  afternoons iced tea and cookies are set out and in the evenings wine and cheese served  enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch relaxing on the back deck retreat or in the privacy of your room  staff is not only eminently professional but warm and gracious  heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (i will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at soba)  if you ever find yourself in pittsburgh lodgings can't get much better than the inn on negleythat's probably sufficient gushing
1,has a four seasonsfrom paris to shanghai london to bangkok the care with which this little b&b operation is run in pittsburgh exceeds the best that i have experienced in any of these citiesit may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel the business center or in-house spa but as a b&b this is about as good as it gets the structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house') is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match these are far from our tastes but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have the tvs aren't even old flat screens but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitanewhere this place really shines is in the staff and the food i actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties when was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysthey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary on this last visit i indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs i forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins on each visit they mix these up for this december visit they did gingerbread cookies (of course) the chef (jackie) from nyc could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurantthere is no elevator so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room the 1st floor room has double doors so i didn't find it any noisier than the others you are in a city and on a reasonably busy street so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back)
1,recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect  heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails the inn itself is gorgeous and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating a++++
1,returned from a three day weekend at the inn with 12 sorority sisters from around the country  it is understandable why the inn gets such rave reviews  from the extraordinary service of the staff which was both accommodating and anticipating to the beautifully furnished and outfitted rooms  (i stayed in the braeburn on the first floor which was large comfortable and filled with light) to the delicious breakfasts it was an outstanding experience all around  i am thrilled to spread the word and recommend your inn without reservation
1,a wonderful location  my sister's future mil hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people we had our own private room  it was tastefully decorated and beautiful  the inn on negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there as wellthe tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious  they even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and i loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around  the food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot sconeswhat a lovely spot for afternoon tea and i look forward to returning again to pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time
1,requested a stay at the inn on negley when traveling on business back to pittsburgh  i lived in town for 5 years and had not had an opportunity to return in more years than that i am afraid this place was just what i needed i sought a more personal experience than a canned commercial hotel could offeri was so grateful to get to stay in this pristine classy comfortable inn the staff was welcoming sweet helpful and kind the room was lovely the best part was waking up in the morning breakfast made me feel like a queen on her birthday the food was perfect gorgeous and delicious the carefully cut fresh fruit salad coffee french toast option and housemade pastries were top shelf the  creative meals and fresh ingredients were professionally planned carefully prepared and out of this world i bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous the treatment is i'd return in a heartbeat
1,for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time  the inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunchservice is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant  the brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit breads entree dessert  and you also have you choice of juices coffee andor teaall the things we tried were delicious  there were so many things i can barely remember  they also serve afternoon tea which i'm sure is fabulous so that's definitely next on my list
1,time having afternoon tea time in the states this place is very beautifully decorated we had the earl grey and peach ginger tea they were really good and the tea stand was amazing
1,absolutely loved our stay at the inn on negley there is so much to review and not enough space to do it we stayed in the cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet it was a room off by itself which i was unaware of at the time of booking that made it so much better the bed was extremely comfortable the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular the only part i didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning the breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental there were eggs belgian waffles pancakes etc to choose from each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry the service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive the staff was one of the most polite and courteous i've ever encountered thank you so much for making our stay perfect i hope to visit again some day
1,"fish and shrimp ensenada style" plate is amazing and the fish and chips are simple and perfect whenever i am here it is pretty empty for some reason but the waitress is very nice and quick i think more people need to stop in
1,seafood at a very good price
1,here for dinner with the family and i loved it i think i heard something about new management because you can definitely tell the service was outstanding very kind and friendly staff the food was great as well the portions are more plentiful now will definitely be coming more often and recommending it to all my friends
1,was quick and friendly seafood was fresh and made to order i had the seafood stuffed filet & my friend had the meatball soup(she gave a thumbs up) we also had the churros w ice cream for dessert and it was delicious (free dessert too wyelp check-in) definitly plan to return
1,love pete's i know i know - you eat outside you have to order tartar sauce and they only take cash i love the food anyway i've gone to pete's since i was born i love the red sauce that comes with the fish - it has a little bite to it i only wish they would expand north i'm addicted to pete's
1,hello this place has been open for over 60 years  on that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from medo they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has i think so because i honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all i had the fish shrimp and chips combo and every item was crispy light and as ungreasy as fried food can get  the interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the "hood" but who cares  darn good fish and chips imho  ---ps they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old american ranch dressing     ranch makes everything better
1,reviews seem to be all over the place  for this the best seafood joint in town  i think their 60 year operation speaks for itself  i've been a semi-regular for years now and love their fish  it's the best breading i've ever tried  almost as important as the fish to me is you must have good tartar sauce  if it's crap you can have the best fish and you've still lost me as a customer  kkl does it rightbest freshest fish and the best tartar in town  a few have mentioned that it's not in the best neighborhood  what does this really mean  does location have some effect on a restaurants ability to cook food  or does your concern for it's location say more about you
1,sister-in-law's mom forces her and my brother to take her to knock kneed lobster every time she comes into town from baltimore  we met up with them 2 piece fish and shrimp wchips  they even have pasta for the vegetarians  the mizithra cheese pasta was way way way better than the spaghetti factory  we got a side of hush puppiessoooo yummy  way way way better than pete's fish and chips (which is still good)there is only 1 problem  no diet coke pepsi products :(
1,the past 15 years or so i have been a satisfied and happy customer of kkl  i absolutely love everything about knock kneed  the fish is among the best that you will find in the phoenix area  i am also a big fan of the okra  the ambiance here is also quite enjoyable  there is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the nautical themed decorations make it one of a kindyou can't go wrong here
1,a craving for fish and chips best place in town i think great fish and shrimp
1,am a big fan of knock kneed lobsterit really is a dive but jeannie behind the counter is one of the kindest people i have ever met in food service  we had the king crab legs for only $1595 with 2 sides  most of the side choices are deep fried but the were all hand breaded and prepared when ordered no frozen and fried side orders here like most every other place you go  this no-frills "joint" prepares each meal for the customer as they arrive  i doubt that they even own a heat lamp  oh btw  our meal was great  i shall return
1,you want good fish and chips this is the place hand filleted  very light batter on the fish fries are old fashioned not processed and frozen elsewhere the only place that compares is spud fish and chips in seattle wa on greenlakethese are the best fish and chips in the world
1,far as basic fried fish and chips goes knock need has it down yes it's a total dive hole in the wall and if you don't like the ambience get it to go  better than other local city chains  they batter their own fish and if someone asked me where to go for good fried fish in the phoenix area it would be knock kneed where they get the lobster part in their name i have no idea
1,grand parents came here back when it was called "lazy lew's" back in the 50's the place is a total dive but it's fitting and its in an industrial part of phoenix however the food is great and so is their home made hot sauce
1,am a big fan of knock kneed lobsterit really is a dive but jeannie behind the counter is one of the kindest people i have ever met in food service  we had the king crab legs for only $1595 with 2 sides  most of the side choices are deep fried but the were all hand breaded and prepared when ordered no frozen and fried side orders here like most every other place you go  this no-frills "joint" prepares each meal for the customer as they arrive  i doubt that they even own a heat lamp  oh btw  our meal was great  i shall return----------------ok  i returned  had the grilled lobster  never had lobster on a paper plate but it didn't take anything away  two bites in and i forgot the paper plate and plastic "silverware" what a delicious treat-----------i love this "hole-in-a-wall"the fish is what most people order  so i tried it  another winner
1,ate here for the first time today and it was awesome  had the catfish sandwich and the best i have had since chicago you need to eat here
1,the fish skip the chips few things are better than a made-to-order hand-breaded fresh fish sandwich this catfish filet was not frozen the cornmeal breading was very crunchy cooked perfectly light flaky not greasy at all just a perfect sandwich all around get this the combo plate was only $650 seriously awesomewhen asked if i wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich i replied "both" best decision ever the hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor (note: i'm not a big tartar sauce fan bc it hides the flavor of the fish)so skip the fries they're just frozen potatoes that don't taste like anything i'm still giving mandy's 5 stars because the sandwich was truly exceptional and honestly didn't come for the fries but ask them which sides are made on site the onion rings and fried okra are probably good ps-don't worry about it being catfish it's seriously goodpps-i grew up around a lot of fish fries in kentucky no catfish has ever been this good go
1,you truly love fish this is the spot i went in at mandys and ordered the cat combo which includes three catfish three shrimp and chips truly it was the best decision ever
1,for the first time today  and really liked it  mandy was very friendly and talked over the menu with me it being my first time  the cod was amazing and juicy not greasy i really liked the homemade cocktail sauce  i am glad i stopped in and i am sure i will be back
1,location is isolated for being by the light rail we stopped by on a sunday at noon there were no other customers at the time the establishment is very clean and ventilated the style has character and thankfully does not clutter the walls with kitchy decorations the staff is very friendly as well as attentive we ordered fried calamari rings and catfish shrimp combos with drinks the prices are very reasonable although there was a discrepancy on the chalk written price the fish is freshly battered on the spot and the food is cooked in a timely manner the batter and oil for each food item is specialized the calamari rings were excellent with the marinara sauce they were not too crunchy and not too rubbery just perfect the catfish came in three long strips over steak fries three shrimp and sides of sauces moist tender crunchy and packed with flavor is how i would describe both the catfish and butterfly shrimp the green tea reminds me of the imported teas in international markets in california we will order from this place for office lunches in the future
1,empty during lunch hour no frills restaurant located off of the 28th street washington light rail station had the three piece catfish meal with fries  shrimp hush puppies and a large drink for under $12 meal is cooked to order instead of sitting in a bin under a heat lamp waiting for you generous portions scalding hot and unlike those other places comes with more fish than breading flavorful and great value definitely will be back
1,stuffed myselfto an inappropriate level each piece of fish is perfectly crisp and fried the oil is fresh so the fish is always light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside they're secret is the cornmeal fry mixture they use they also use it in their hushpuppies---to die for next time i'm going for the slaw and sweet potato side  this'll be my new late-night haunt for folks when they come to visit
1,was looking for fish on a friday with three kids in the car and didn't want to get out no problem because mandy ' s has a mother's most coveted convenience a drive through  if you don't call ahead expect to wait because the fish is freshly cooked crispy hot and delicious we may have to make this a regular friday event and add dessert they have perfectly cooked sweet potatoes pie to satisfy that sweet tooth yum yum delicious mandy's
1,there many times and never had anything but good food the person that said that the bulgogi was so-so must have killed their taste budsbest in town and we have tried almost all of em this is their 3 rd location over 20 years so they must be doing something right cash only terrible location and other drawbacks but worth the drive for us from summerlin
1,love this hole in the wall korean joint  i have only ordered one dish from there and that's all i really need  the beef bulgogi is amazing  i get it spicy with noodles instead of rice  definitely worth a visit
1,this place love the food love the atmoshpere  it seems like the menu is always changing herebutternut squah croquettes are awesome the black bean veggie burger is swell
1,small english pub tucked away in  an alley behind harris teeter  they have a huge outdoor eating area  the inside has a large community table in the back for when the restaurant gets crowded  they have an extensive beer selection  as far as the food goes you have to be very careful  i have tried many things on the menu and i have only been impressed by the bacon cheeseburger and the fish and chips  but the bacon cheeseburger is the best you'll get anywhere  the food is also very affordable
1,ed's: have to say i was there the first night they opened their doors and have been returning ever since it has the best of many worlds go early enough it is a great restaurant with a "different" menu than what you would expect (you have to try the ostrich meatloaf) go a little later in the evening it is the classic "pub" i enjoy them both i have been to restaurants and pubs all over europe and the usa  sir ed's ranks right up there with the best of themit is a great place to go for a celebration or just to grab a beer in the evening draft selection is great a true bonus if you like english beer (and guinness) i have always found the staff to be outstandingover the years they have had a couple that were not up to the task but thankfully they did not last bar staff is always wonderful and accommodating and over the years have become friends great place to go
1,my i love sir ed's it is without a doubt the best bar in charlotte sir ed's doesn't have the biggest beer list or any unique drinks but they make up for it in quality my last few years of college i came in about once a week sometimes more i chose sir eds for my first legal drinks now when i come back to charlotte the trip isn't complete without a plate of jamaican jerk chicken nachos and a beer sir ed's has some of the best barpub food  you'll find worth coming just for dinner in the springsummerfall the patio is fantastic my world felt like it fell apart when sir ed's closed briefly and i am so happy they're back
1,food best atmosophere in charlotte a true local tradition make sure to stop in for a pint
1,ed's is my favorite kid friendly bar in town  we have been going here for years  my children ask to go every weekend  love their new kid menu  it actually has healthy items
1,ed's hosted a casual wedding reception for our daughter  they were extreamly helpful in creating a special menu  food and service were great  this was a great place to hold a special event
1,ed's is a local's restaurant and bar and as such is perfectnote to non-locals: you will find a warm welcomepart of the attraction of sir ed's is the 'hidden' location down an alley between the ski store and rack room shoes head down the stairs and through the door without the sign and you're in a special placeyou'll finda sensibly-priced menu with a curious mix of pub favorites mexican-inspired dishes and some simply way-out-there items there's plenty for the vegetarian and even the vegana great staff including two of charlotte's top bartendersa superb patio in the warmer months plus a great 'warm and cozy' feel in the winterfull menu until 2 am every nightmorninga generally civilized atmosphereyou can hear what the person next to you is saying even when sir ed's is fulla great lunch menu with some excellent dealsfull bar with an always interesting selection of beers and winesthere's a reason that 'sir ed's virgins' become regulars it's a special placeyou also get free birthday on your dinnergo to this link http:eepurlcomg_tta
1,wings are the best wings in charlotte  grilled to a perfect char with a sweet ginger teriyaki sauce they are perfectchicken fried chicken black bean burger fish & chips butternut squash croquettes and jerk chicken nachos are also highly recommended
1,bottles on wine on sunday i don't think i need to say more but i will i just love this place it's cozy and off the beaten path the fish and chips were perfection as was the goat cheese fritters i can't wait to go backon a sunday of course
1,avenue is just classic went there this weekend with friends their fish fry is great - but we went for steaks and prime rib some of the best in town easily i love their shrimp too i agree with joe r - - its far from health food i went with the baked potato instead of the hash browns just to lower my total grease intake very good food and great atmosphere and service
1,from a city that has elevated the friday fish fry to a culinary art form i'm delighted to see the avenue fish fry throwin' it down in mad-town the fish pieces are plump and juicy the breading flavorful and the presentation always high quality and not overly greasy good selection of sides nice old school wisconsin atmoshphere be prepared to wait a long time for a table on a friday night popular place
1,up in a family that didn't really eat a lot of fish i made it to my 30's without actually eating a "fish boil"  visiting madison i decided the right thing to do was to finally sample this regional delicacy  a little research led me to the avenue bar a place that will now always hold a special place in my heartwhat's not to love  it's been open since the mid-fifties and probably hasn't changed much since then  it is like a combo dive barrestaurant and is chaotic beyond belief on the weekends  packed with families blue hairs the beer and a shot crowd lions clubmasonic order-types and various other characters this is the kind of place archie bunker would have been right at home at and i was as well  you can just tell these people have been coming in here for 50 years every friday night - it's fantastic one of the happiest crowds i've ever seen people love this place i agree with the other reviewers - make a reservationthe food was fantastic - i had the fish boil my friend had the fish fry  insanely good - i don't even know how to put it into words but that fish boil still haunts my dreams cod potatoes carrots onion all cooked together in one heavenly mess - it sounds weird but dammit you have to eat it to believe it  hands down one of the best meals i've ever eaten  the fried cod was equally great  it's a classic and they have it perfected here this is artery clogging food at it's best  i can't believe they don't make you sign a waiver before you eat herelocally owned great wait staff very inexpensive loaded with character - easily my favorite dining destination in madison
1,friday fish-fry is to die for (stick with the traditional cod) no wonder they've been voted as the madison's 1 fish-fry favorites year after year call ahead and make a reservation if you are planning to go for the friday affair the place is literally packed my friend and i got lucky and was seated at the nice booth seat right next to the bar while waiting for our food to come we got to watch locals enjoying themselves at the bar my bloody marry was a perfect accompaniment to the cod i think my friend enjoyed his martini and perch as well  the food is excellent the service is excellent and it's got the homey atmosphere - i have nothing to complain about this place
1,service solid food consistent and reliable you will not be disappointed if you go to the avenue for drinks or for dinner a very good value for your dollar only thing that doesn't live up to billing is the dessert
1,grew up in wisconsin eating at avenue bar was like stepping right back into 1971 i could really sense my wisconsin roots went for a friday night fish fry had the cod loved their bloody mary and the brandy alexander brought tears of joy to my eyes oh yeah-- the fish fry was also great a "must visit" place they have a fish boil as well
1,love this place it brought back so many wisconsin memories since that is where i grew up we had the  brandy old fashion sweet they make a good one and we had the fish fry--- yummm many a friday night was spent at the local fish fry places when we lived there the crowning touch was a brandy alexander they don't make them with ice cream any where but in wisconsin--- to die for
1,stopped in the avenue this past saturday after the badger-beaver football game and were very pleased to see the live music behind the bar as usual for home games   very funsince being purchased by the food fight people the avenue has been different but the same  the different is all good - cleaned up remodeled bathrooms spruced up all around  craig managing the bar is godsend for the avenue  the same is good too with nearly every staff member retained great pours on drinks and good food and servicemost of the negative reviews on yelp came at the tail end of the past era when things were not so goodit's really worth a try now  do it  and support those saturday afternoon musicians
1,service  excellent food  we have passed this place up for years  we always thought it was as the name says a bar  yes it has a bar but it is only a precursor to a wonderful meal  we have enjoyed ourselves here many times  i highly recommend you try it out  you'll be hooked
1,walked in and i was taken back into time i am a "mature" seasoned citizen the avenue reminded me of numerous restaturant & bars in chicago not too bright not too dim crowded and lots of lively conversation coming from the bar and restaurant i came here for the fish fry i heard it was top notch they were right started off with an excellent new england clam chowder there were substantial pieces of clams in the soup surprise surprise very well seasoned i did not even consider adding salt or pepper i am sensitive to salt and it was not overdone next came the fried cod it wasn't a long john silver's fry it was more like a tempura batter a light coating over two large fillets i chose fries to accompany the plate for a friday night at 7:00pm only had to wait 15 minutes very courteous and accommodating staff well i will be back to try other items on the menu but then again maybe not i have been to the top of the mountain i like fish too give them a tryjohnny chitown
1,food drinks and views  great place to come by boat in the summer
1,great neighborhood hangout with good food and great beer  this is the place to be on a summer night and usually something fun happening on the ice in the winter  the place is loaded with character(s) and is a true wisconsin tavern on the lake
1,have not much to review as of now but will update later as  i have just booked quivey's for my wedding in august 2009 if anyone has had thier wedding here and would like to share with me photos i am planning the wedding long distance and it would be greatly appreciatedso far i have talked with the business event manager 3 times and she was great each time i had a long list of questions before i put down a small deposit and she answered each one
1,the stable grill great drinks great food great atmosphere so romantic around christmas i just wish they had more variety on the menu we try to go here often
1,consensus opinion among the eight people at our table is that quivey's has the best friday fish fry we've tried it also has a really interesting ambiance with a fun underground tunnel connecting the quieter more formal seating in the stone house to the more casual dining in the stable grill for a night out with our family and a family of friends it's a lot better to eat in the stable grill portion of the restaurant rather than the (more formal) stone house: the stable is more suited to our boisterous group but you'll still want to walk through the tunnel to the wine cave and the stone house just to look around if you have to wait for a table (they do a brisk business so it's best to call ahead) also the cheese curds are only available in the stable grill portion (and the kids like these even better than the ones at the old fashioned though the parents might split hairs on that one)
1,fish fry try the parmesan potatoes you will not be disappointing very affordable fish fry great atmosphere and service we tried the pudding for desert which was also delicious we will be returning and recommending our friends there are two restaurants but on fridays both serve the fish fry the bar doesn't take reservations and is first come first serve usually a 30 min wait so grab a beer if you don't want to wait jump over the house and there usually is seating available we are hoping to experience the barn next time
1,is a review of their thursday nights jazz in the grovewe had a very enjoyable evening with some fantastic jazz  we hope to go back again this yearthis is a unique venue for madison and i hope it continues   we need more places like thisthanks quivey's
1,salomon salad for lunch was simply the best food i have eaten for 11 bucks  the service was fantastic  sometimes i wonder if people who complain about bad service receive bad service because they are not the friendliest people themselves  i also was here for a grooms dinner and there wasn't a complaint in the party  my beef tenderloin was awesome
1,night fish fry
1,is my favorite place for friday fish fry i can't find a better place in madison
1,benchmark for reviews  you're given the choice between the main house or the stable - the former caters to an older crowd the latter a younger one  try the stable first - bigger menu more affordable prices  the food: flavorgasm-inducing  the service: friendly prompt and non-obtrusive  the setting: interesting and relatively quiet  they make a nice drink too  on a friday try the combo plate of fish and thank me later  bacon-wrapped pork beef medallions meatloaf chicken i'm already looking forward to returning
1,you ever live anywhere near madison you need to go to this place  the bar in the stable serves drinks strong and perfectly poured  literally anything off the menu is going to burst with flavor  the stone house and the stable grill both offer really cool experiences; be sure to take a walk through the cool tunnel that serves as a wine cellar and connects the twoi think quivey's grove is best enjoyed when you're planning to spend an hour or so at the bar waiting for a table preferably on one of those cold winter nights where it's so brutal that you can't stand the walk from the car to the restaurant door  quivey's practically exists to keep you warm
1,love being in downtown phoenix and this was a perfect lunch spot  i love their other location as well on camelback  i'm always happy with their fresh food and great service - another must go if you haven't yet 
1,start with the disclaimer that i really like the people that work at this place which is downstairs from my work  the food is always great quality and if you need a last minute "gift" they have wine and many other goodies to make a  basket (which i have done)the happy hour serves local beers and their house wine is only $300 which makes it irresistible for a bargain shopper like me (and it's good too)stop by and say hello to ally pierce gloria and dave - and rest of the gang  people are not strangers there for long
1,love the duck best quality sandwich in town yeah they are a little expensive but if it's good i don't mind spending the money who wants cheap crap no thank youi swung by on my way home the other day to grab some lunch for the boyfriend and i and i was a little worried about the parking situation but i was pleasantly surprised that there was no issue lunch in downtown had just wrapped up as it was about 2pm so it was fairly quiet pulled into a metered spot that even had 45 minutes left on it from the last person thank youi recommend either the turkey with provolone on a butter croissant or the pastrami with swiss on sour dough make sure to grab some pickles when you check out they are the best
1,of my favorite sandwich places since the early 80sit's my nooner stop any time i am downtown phoenix or at the town and country areabread so fresh and such tasty sandwiches for all tastes
1,people and awesome food
1,know that feeling of wanting to try something new and not wanting to settle for good-but-typical restaurants when you're visiting an area this place does the job for a good pricefor it being a specialty sandwich shop (ie serving duck) it has reasonable prices (~$875) for their signature the duckling sandwich which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese)  mind blown their bread is so soft its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouthfresh ingredients so goodmy friend had the brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto brie sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which btw was of excellent quality; not the waxy can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn goodthey also have so many gourmet snacks bakery items and sweets on the counter for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal but what i thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$150 each) for you to sample with your lunch i got 3: the marble triple creme blue and the prima donna gouda if you care here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all triple creme was the winner it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph prima donna gouda was meh fancy cheese without the price tag commitment oh yes pls ps why is it so hard to spell prosciutto correctly
1,is the kind of place that i would visit all the time if i lived nearby the concept is solid (order what you want and it's written on your brown paper bag and you pay when they call your name) i chose the spinach salad which was great quality bacon feta and sundried tomatoes on a bed of spinach with a creamy mustard poppy dressing people were so friendly here that's what really made it worth it there were plenty of tables available at noon on a weekday
1,tasting food great service and has been around for years presence was a mystery to me for awhile so maybe an improvement could be better more recognizable signage out front or up above other than that it's a hidden gem here in downtown
1,spot for a quick lunch if you're downtown  they offer mainly sandwiches  chips  soups chilli salads cookies and coffeeteasoda for lunch they pack it to go in a lunch sack if you park in the parking garage of the building they are in they will validate for 2 hours
1,been going here since high school now my kids go too as well as my office and friends
1,we checked into the plaza we saw this bar but didn't think anything of it and we weren't sure what it was the appearance detours the place a bit as walking by you can't see inside so by just looking at it and comparing it to all the other bars downtown you wouldn't be able to judge it fairly by just looking at itas i looked through our coupon book the hotel provided upon check in there was a 2 for 1 drink coupon inside and it was labeled the drink we weren't sure where the drink was but decided to go hunting for it we had to wait for our party to come down so we made it our meeting point we asked security where it was and they directed us to the bar we saw earlieras we walked in and sat at the bar the bar tender was cool and made us anything we wanted btw check out the happy hour specialsthe place was pretty big and very roomy there is a good size stage and a huge dance floor there is also tons of seating the vibe was sort of rock n roll with a taste of modern a nice balancelong story short this place was happening by the end of the night we felt very welcomed and ended up staying here all night with our group all the staff was super cool and friendly at night a dj came he was awesome and played anything the people wanted and had a huge variety of music
1,place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me  pf chang's has a dedicated gluten-free menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease  they also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination  i don't know many other restaurants that go this faraside from the menu preference i enjoy my overall experience every time  their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a chinese take-out or buffet joints  don't expect this to be at all like that  it's not a buffet  they don't sell "general tso's" (though chang's spicy chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect  they do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure  they also sell sake i believe they have a few different types  the prices can get a bit more expensive than your average chinese restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it  portions are excellent and the taste is great  i've yet to have one complaint and i have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few yearsthe only downside it can be a little crowded and a bit loud  it's also very dark because of their lighting  however i think it sets the atmosphere  it can be a romantic place or a casual place i've been there for both
1,recently went here for a group dinner with friends  i am unable to eat gluten and my server (denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies  she was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else  i had the gf beef with broccoli and it was amazing  she was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves  we were there for a while and were all on separate checks  i've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain  never once did i feel unwelcome  i will go out of my way to eat here again
1,food great atmosphere little on the loud side but they have turned down the music since the last time we were here so it's much better good service
1,will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend  we got seated quickly with a reservation  our server was excellent despite how busy it was  he was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle  the manager was also great  we weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended  i will say this - they know how to treat their customers we'll definitely be back :)
1,ordered dinner one day and was very satisfied after my dinnerthe food was delicious i enjoyed it some much i bought lunch there the following daythe is now one of my best places to eati would recommend pf chang's china bistro to everyone
1,family loves this restaurant  my children and i suffer from food allergies   i have celiac's disease and their gluten free selection for a chinese restaurant is great  my children are a completely different ball game  they have a rare disease called eosinophilic esophagitus where food attacks their body  they are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten soy eggs dairy nuts tree nuts fish shellfish amd corn  this restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash  the servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful  our favorite manager is joe and favorite server is kevin  call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions
1,place hit the spot stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar we got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats i recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good who knew i liked green beans and this trip i tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful)
1,is one of the greatest restaurants i have ever been to and i wish to god i had the kind of wit and vocabulary to accurately reflect the really really really good meal i had here  as soon as i walked in i felt really special which sounds corny and laughably pathetic but i'm not kiddingi felt like one of angelina jolie's adopted kidsreally special  the host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant  i was mesmerized  our waitress was a sophisticated demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menuwe were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies  my sister and i immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be gooddddddi would spell out every dish and how friggin' awesome it was but i'll post pictures insteadeven the one of me crying at the end of the meal  be sure to read the captionsthe bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting-edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next "bold look of kohler" commercial (in the non-creepiest wayi do realize i'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom)i might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy place like pittsburgh but quite honestly i just need to shut up and visit her more often
1,lounge appears to be the only sign of life in shadyside  moderately trendy 20-40 something year old crowd makes the scene and seem only too happy to make room for you  popped in here only for a nightcap after our lousy taco bellesque dinner at the shady grove and it was the highlight of the evening  i've been coming here off and on for years and the espresso martini is my favorite choice at only $8 per glass  comprehensive beverage menu featuring some excellent wines as well as the darling cans of sofia champagne  as a matter of fact this is the only bar that i have seen offer these besides coppola's restaurant in north beach  if you don't know what they are it's the grown up girl's take on those minute maid drink boxes that your mama packed in your lunch and definitely a girly drink but a bit pricy at $11 per can  next time i return i plan to dine here and i can see soba lounge being my "bar away from sf bars"
1,my hubby and i went there for the first time tonight  its probably our new favorite restaurant in pittsburgh  after they took our coats we were seated on the 2nd teir looking across to the waterfall wall we were there a lil early for dinner (530ish) so we were theonly ones upstairs it was really nice and quiet  service was wonderful and relaxed first ordered the corn chowder and the lobster maki for starters i'm very picky about sushi hubby loves it and he can rarely get me to eat it  it was delcious  i'm actually craving more now that i'm thinking about it  the corn chowder was also very tastey but after 3 or 4 bites you're mouth needs some time to cool down its got some kick but a good kick :)  ohh i almost forgot the complimentary appetizer that the chef sent out i wasn't really listening to her explain it but it was some sort of delcious hummus on a truffle infused chip amazing  they should put iton the menu :)  for entrees i got the pad thai and hubby got the filet  both were really good the filet especially  probably one of the best steaks i've had  hubby gobbled down the whole thing  but i had to box up most of my pad thai i think the sushi and the corn chowder filled me up andi wanted to save room for a dessertomg  we shared the frozen cashew terrine  orgasmic  this will be our new regular place i think :)
1,place that i went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh great atmosphere great drinks great food ahh soba if only all pittsburgh restaurants could be like you the world would be a better place
1,bit on the pricey side but wow is this place greatwent here with my wife for our anniversary and it quickly has become my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh  i would go here every week if i could afford itmy favorite of all the big burrito places
1,beer specials when i've had their beer specials for the night  appetizers & entrees are usually perfectly sized if not a little large  the one exception is the fried calamari - the plate was probably about twice the size it needed to bethe complementary small-portioned appetizer (i know there's a name for that but can't think of it off the top of my head) is always been delicious  the seafood is extremely fresh and all of the flavors are very good  attentive (but not at all annoying) service with friendly waitstaff nice decor and a great atmosphere for parties sized from 2 to 20
1,is not only a great lounge but also a great restaurant  part of the big burrito group soba has a pan-asian cuisine  the lounge area is somewhat small but even when the bar is crowded it doesn't take too long to get a drinkthe food is fabulous and the atmosphere in the dining area is anything but crowded  multiple floors and an outside deck gives you a number of choices on where to eat
1,great way to spend the night  loved the seafood salad with soba noodles   asian cloppino and the filet have never disappointed  would love to try everything on the menu
1,had read about soba in pittsburgh magazine i was intrigued when i saw that soba was numbero uno according to a recent reader's poll and doubly impressed that it was listed as one of the magazine's top 25 restaurants in the city with a build up like that i was very excited to dine here we had an early evening reservation the exterior is described as 3 story victorian looked like a homely dump to me inside was a very different story sleek and modern with a zen like garden feel we were excited as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area i thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic i started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat i was taken aback by the color a sort of dreary garymustard but it was very delicious very spicy my bbf had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens we were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips for dinner we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot the filet was extremely thick and served with a nice vegetable mixture and potatoes  the flavor was amazing  the seafood looked delicious i sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned dessert was also just as amazing we shared the vanilla-roasted asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit asian pear sorbet and sabayon we also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan it was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly all in all a very special evening everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good  i have to agree with the readers of pittsburgh mag
1,is one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh  the corn chowder and filet are winners the service is always top notch and the bar scene is great
1,you like authentic chinese food like me you will love this place i am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons herei guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and americanized food i never tried the americanized dishes but the chinese ones are decent i always just order their specials which are listed on the first page of their menumy favorite dishes are: chinese style mapo tofu beijing duck (you need to order it ahead) fish with the spicy sauce (the spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers it has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug)  and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots
1,will say this is as good as it gets for vegetarian chinese food plus they deliver to my apartmenti got the kong pao wheat gluten & veggie lo mein it wasn't excessively spicy but enough to make it flavorful i ordered this for myselfi had a huge plate of both with some white rice & a spring roll i literally still have enough for 2 more meals with a total of $2250 it was the best quick & tasty sunday dinner for a non-meat eater
1,is my favorite place in the area and i would eat here everyday if i could their vegan options are extensive and amazingly delicious the won-ton soup is vegan friendly too at least that's what the server told me portion sizes are generous the soy protein is to die for and the price is right this place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans but omnis won't know the differencei've visited this location a handful of times and each experience has been nothing but pleasant i have tried the fried mushrooms the sesame soy protein the orange soy protein the sweet & sour soy protein the wheat gluten veggie mix the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup my favorite is the sesame soy protein but i plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point the wheat gluten is tasty but it's not the best i've ever had i prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten the spicy dishes are never spicy you can always ask for extra chile paste like i do though it's weird that they aren't spicy enough but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods my last visit here on april 1st was definitely the most memorable the sweetest young male was our server he forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein and he apologized profusely and fixed it he kept bringing us refills especially on my diet coke restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills but he was generous he also gave us free rice refills and since we all love rice we were immensely grateful i can't say enough good things about this kid but i hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitudechina palace is a win for sure
1,favorite chinese restaurant in pittsburgh clean flavorful close in proximity priced right friendly service food comes out quickly and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm (since pittsburgh is the "city that sleeps") the only dish i don't like and got confused with is their walnut shrimp in the west coast it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet but in this restaurant its salty and does not have any coconut flavor so i don't order it anymore and i wish they delivered to the downtown area
1,good place for chinese food the service is good too also the lunch special is a good bargain for a student the manager is nice the price (except lunch special) is a little higher than other places but this is on walnut st so this is understandable the suggestion is to provide more spicy foods (by "spicy" i mean really spicy:)
1,don't know what the hell you're talking about or order the wrong dish do yourself a favor order the lemon chicken with seshwan* sauce instead of lemon saucethank my later
1,love their vegan  vegetarian menu the food is so good just remember to ask them to hold the msg friendly service clean nice atmosphere
1,been going to fujo's for the last 5 months or so and i must say that after a long day of work their seafood su and dragon roll always hit the spot  they also have chinese food if you actually want your fish cooked  and the service is consistently fast and friendly  five stars
1,is the first time i've been here  first of all the singapore noodles was the best i have ever tasted in my life and i've had several  the waitress was great  the bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away  i don't mind saying i may eat here again tomorrow
1,staying in uptown charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner based on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable priced well reviewed ready walking distance option from our hotel  this one is rated with two $$  truthfully some of the best sushi i've ever had  my boyfriend and i split 3 rolls; the coastal roll panther roll and the godzilla roll  they were not skimpy by any means there was almost am entire roll left when i had to give up so the man happily picked up the slack  i'm only on town for the weekend so i have no idea if they run specials throughout the week  i will absolutely come back next time i'm here and will recommend to my friend who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)
1,was traveling for work and stayed at the hilton so figured i would check fujo out great service and really delicious sushi the prices were very reasonable and the portions were large i got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good i also got a rainbow martini which was yummy i'll definitely go back when i travel to charlotte
1,know what's crazy i've been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time i've actually checked in i gotta step my game up anyhow godzilla sushi roll is the truth you can't go wrong ordering that i'm seriously stuffed after eating i mean the crunchy tempura outside the savory sauce the fresh avocado the ingredients make love in my mouth seriously in my opinion there's no need to try anything elseservice is spot on every time i'm there everyone is very attentive and you can't beat the area i always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile even if i have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday it's worth it i go hard for some sushi especially the godzilla roll get on it
1,am from cali; and we love our sushi; was worried that i might never find good sushi while here this place proved me wrong; great sushi; super quick for call ins and across fom my school; so excited might be a weekly place for me
1,a groupon here to try it out and decided to buy another because we knew we'd come backgo for dinner sit outside and enjoy an amazing view of downtown something you can't really get from many uptown restaurants views of many buildings but set back from the street just a really great location for eveningsushi: they have interesting rolls like ones with sweet potatoes that i've never seen any where else really yummy sushi of all typesdrinks: really good mixed drinks and sake limited wine and beerservice: truly excellent
1,have had a lot of good sushi in charlotte but the godzilla roll at fujo just completely blew me away  it is the best sushi i have ever had  delicious just doesn't fully describe it  when the menu says "must try" they aren't kidding  it is spicy tuna and avocado fried tempura style and topped with special sauce  the sauce was superb  the roll is large so it is a good one to share but you won't want to because you will want to eat it all yourself
1,you ever left a place and thought: what took me so long to get here that happened to me at fujo's my girlfriends and i celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off yep i'm officially a fan i'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi we started with the steamed pork dumplings classic i also ordered the rainbow martini-- it's cranberry vodka pineapple and midori the presentation was excellent and they were very heavy handed with the liquor  and there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl that thing is deliciousbut let's get to what everyone wants to know aboutthe sushi i ordered the godzilla roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my "go to" roll when i'm here i clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a "must try" on the menu it's packed with spicy tuna avocado and then deep fried tempura style my goodness how could you go wrong with that combination  do yourself a favor and get over to fujo's it's definitely worth a try
1,sushi i've had so far in charlotte make sure you try their coastal roll; my husband and i were floored by the sushi quality and the pricewonderful restaurant and evening all around
1,freeallergy sensitivehuge gf menu with many options for appetizers entree's and desserti alsoways have the gf cucumbers shanghai noodles and chocolate domenever had a problem here-the waiter told me a secret the gf food is always served on round plates and the non-gf is served on square plates
1,yea i'm a fan for sho so my better and half and i frequent this place quite a bit  it's awesome  make a reservation they're always busy  so for a surprise bday party they were incredibly accommodating for the 12 people that i had invited and even allowed for me to bring an ice cream cake and borrow their ice box for it  the waitress was a rock star by far this passed time  she got every ones order correctly entered and the kitchen rocked it out  i recommend the curry veggies  yum  as far as the bday  oh yea he was surprised and the cake was epic world of warcraftwith people coming from around the restaurant to check it out once the kitchen prepped it  i hear i got some bonus points for this one :)
1,here for lunch was busy but food and service were great
1,has to be my favorite place to eat  the food is always consistent and worth waiting for  i have never had a bad meal here  i crave the orange peel shrimp occasionally and have to go get my fix  their lettuce wraps are the best around  i've tried them from other restaurants and they don't hold a candle to pf chang's  it is very moderately priced and affordable but the ambiance of the establishment gives you the feel of a more upscale and expensive dining experience  if you haven't been yet you have to try it
1,family really loves pf changs  in fact our 11-year-old wanted her birthday meal with the family here  we really enjoy the happy hour specials 3p-6p  we get a little bit of everything off the appetizer menu that feeds a family of four perfectly
1,husband and i are frequent diners at pf changs and we genuinely love it  we typically steer-clear of chain restaurants but we always make an exception for pf changs  we've been going there for years and we have never had a bad meal  there are some dishes that we like better than others but we have never had a sub-par dining experience   the food is consistently good and the service is always excellentmy husband and i dined at pf changs last night (saturday night) and we brought another couple with us  i made online reservations earlier in the day and had no trouble getting the time that i wanted (6:30)   when we arrived the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking  the restaurant was very very busythere people waiting outside as well  we arrived just after 6:30 and they had us seated within 5 minutes  we started with drinksblue moon for my husband asian pear mojito for me (delicious) bacardi & coke and red wine for our friends  for appertizers we ordered pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps  when the runner brought the chicken lettuce wraps he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldn't have to share just one dishso a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce) on the house  very nice way to start off our meal   to me it's those types of gestures that kicks pf changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years   the lettuce wraps were hot fresh flavorful and delicious  the pork dumplings were also very tastyon to the entreestuna tataki crisps for me  they are so excellent  round fried wonton as the vessel topped with seared ahi tuna topped with diced ahi tuna cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce  the crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together  mongolian beef for my husband  this is the best mongolian beef that we have found to date  the sauce is scrumptious the meat is lean tender and moist and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dishour friends ordered orange peel chicken and dan dan noodles and they both loved their dishesfor the table to sharegarlic noodles (my favorite)  i crave these noodles  the menu describes this dish as "egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes"  however that description doesn't do it justice  the noodles are tender the sauce is savory but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness and it's topped with julienned cucumber and fresh cilantro  outstanding served fresh even better eaten cold (out of the fridge) the next dayif it makes it that long   i've been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next daypork fried rice (my husband's favorite)  everyone has their fried rice preferences  for us we don't like sticky fried rice we don't like it over seasoned (over salty) and we don't like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use)  chang's fried rice is made with egg julienne carrots bean sprouts sliced scallions and just the right amount of soy sauce  perfectwe completed our meal with a couple of dessert ministiramisu and lemon dream  both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal  excellent meal once again  we all left full satisfied and happy  we will continue to dine to pf changs over and over again  yes we really love it that much  the dishes may not be "authentic' but there is something to be said for consistently delicious asian-inspired food  for us pf changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend  we all have many acquaintances that we enjoy but the reliable friends are few and far betweenps i've posted pictures of the entrees
1,food and great drinks  we didn't have to ask for anything  anything  they anticipated everything we needed  great dinner
1,this area on business & decided to try it - no regrets  sat at bar solo  nice drink beer wine list including 4 "tap" wines  ordered lettuce wrap app then seasonal special curry noodle dish  over-delivered and exceeded expectations for sure  friendly staff great food
1,service in the world i ordered my soup and 3 minutes there it was me and my family went because we were traveling and it was very close to are hotel and the waiter was amazing he was busy but kept our drinks full and cleaned up plates fast and since it was july 4 we asked if he knew any firework shows around and he told us the closest place food was amazing and since i have braces i got egg drop soup and chicken fried rice and i'm glad i did it was amazing and didn't have to wait long at all will be going to more pf changs soon
1,andre is amazing  me being away from home he made me feel at homeif that makes sense
1,far my favorite chinese restaurant in charlotte  have been going to great wall for the past 12 years and no chinese place in charlotte has come close to replacing itfood has always been good and is always consistent  from the egg drop soup to the spring rolls to the entrees everything is great  i highly recommend the shrimp and broccoli but really everything there is worth tryingwait staff is very attentive bordering on too attentive at times  food comes out fast and hot  the owner is friendly and enjoys chattinggood with large parties there are two rooms in the back of the restaurant that can be joined or separated depending on the size of your party
1,family has been coming here for over 20 years and i've always had a great meal great specials diversity and service i think this is the best chinese restaurant in the charlotte area the best egg drop soup i've ever had
1,best chinese place in charlotte (or rock hill sc) this restaurant should be tried by people that haven't liked chinese food in the past because they do it right my favorite is the beef and mixed vegetables ample portions food (including the rice) perfectly cookedmake sure (if ordering take out) to ask for some of the "homemade mustard sauce" to put on your spring roll or egg roll it's great but be careful it's hot
1,not sure if the folks are reviewing the same restaurant that i have enjoyed since 1985 i live in florida now but come back to charlotte 4-5 times a year and the great wall is always a must destination my order is always the same and it is always delicious- great wall special trio; spicy no vegetables fried rice and hot & sour soupwe have not been able to find good chinese in north florida we would be so happy if we could get chinese food the caliber of great wall
1,you speak mandarin you can request whatever asian cuisine your heart desires  bliss  since my chinese is about as rocky as a kindergarten students' i like to drag my parents with me  we always order up a storm- not exactly sure how to translate the dishes ordered but i'm sure you get the point  this is as authentic as authentic gets in charlotte (even some of the foods on the regular menu)  absolutely love the owner the wait staff and the foodstep out of your comfort zone  that's how you'll get to experience the authentic  junk like sweet and sour chicken is not authentic  have fun
1,coming here for years alex tiffany cathy and all the staff make me feel welcome the food is always consistent and good i generally take out but when dining in the experience is always good one thing you must do is spend some time looking at their salt water fish tanks these tanks are incredible and worth visiting the restaurant just to enjoy them
1,coming to the gw for almost thirty years  back in 1982 it was one of the few places to eat in the carmel commons area  (other than little ceasars mamma rosas in pineville & chucky cheese)  yah i'm old  i remember when winn-dixie was still in carmel commons    family owned  super friendly managers  gets busy on weekends  very fast take-out serviceonce bumped into jim & tammy baker during lunch standard "american" chinese food  poo poo platter fun with the flaming sterno cauldron  they do have a real chinese menu but you'll need to ask for it  bar area waiting  kids love the multiple fish tanks  fun place to people watch  don't worry if your kid spills fried rice all over the floor  they won't fret about it  always ask for the house made mustard and duck sauce if you're getting take-out  bummed baskin robbins closed  as for years we'd stuff outselves on beef & brocoli and then waddle down for a pint of mint choc chipbe careful about drinking and driving  cmpd and even pineville patrol the area on a regular basis  better to get a cab than put yourself in that situation
1,have been going to great wall since 1983 it has always been great and it's the restaurant by which i judge all other chinese restaurants it is consistent reasonably prices good services and delicious food the staff is very courteous and i am always well served if i ever do have a problem they are more than compliant great place
1,been going to the great wall of china south for quite a while the owner alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking i am a pescatarian so i don't know how their meats are however i can tell you about a few of their dishes my all time favorite dish is one of their specialties the "crispy scallops" the portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet this does not come with any vegetables i recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce i always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) for appetizers the "steamed veggie dumplings" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce the "crab rangoon" is okay the "spring rolls" are greasy but good make sure to have extra napkins also i've tried the "sa cha scallops" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish although i like it very spicy the restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years love this place always keeps me coming back
1,best chinese in charlotte my boyfriend and i are regulars there the food is amazing and the fish tanks are beautiful if you are a vegetarian like myself they have plenty of option i get the mixed veggies in brown sauce so good
1,is one of my favorite places to eat since i was a kid growing up here in charlotte we still go there a few times a year as a family when we have a large group together great place for birthdays as well always seems like the food is consistent and has remained solid over the years ingredient quality is much higher than other hibachi places i have been to service is accommodating  recently i have been hitting the sushi bar sometimes and we have been very pleased with the nigiri and rolls we have tried some of the newer sushi places that keep popping up but have realized that we should stick with nakato's
1, the bartender was excellent  service was great  our chef was awesome  and the food was amazing  we'll definitely be back
1,this place usually aways busy  good sushi and great hibachi grill lobster chicken filet mignon all great
1,only complaint-make a reservation and by far the food is well worth the wait  i have never went to japanese where noodles and rice was served with your meal vegetables included carrots mushrooms the norm zucchini and onions  the staff was great the food was excellent
1,a fan of this place since they moved to pineville from the independence location over the years we gave celebrated many birthdays & anniversaries here  food is always yummy you get a lot - so if you leave hungry - i wonder what's wrong with you  the appetizer soup and salad are just the beginning - i tend to stay with basic hibachi shrimp and filet which are always wonderful  the fried rice is the all time favorite item for me  the chef that cooks are generally as entertaining as you want - the more you engage them the more fun it is  for me - hands down there's no better japanese steakhouse in charlotte food is fresh - seafood is yummy - entertainment is always good 
1,time favorite japanese restaurant hibachi shrimp is my fav fried rice is the best  never disappoints
1,favorite dining place to go as a family  nakato's is our go to restaurant  we love the food and hot sake  staff is friendly  though we love all of the chefs we are partial to (carlos and alan)  david the manager is very friendly too
1,experience we went to celebrate my wife birthday  everybody had a good time with great meal portion on every dish are plenty about service  excellent 
1,little sushi place worth trying i'm vegetarian so i can only speak for the vegetarian dishes but its tasty fresh and easy
1,personally rank this place as the best sushi restaurant in town they don't use msg and its safe for pregnant woman like me i've tried muramoto takara but sushibox was the only place that i could finish my plate
1,love this place i wish i could get here more often but something always comes up when they are openi love their vegetarianvegan sushi options it's quite impressive when compared to all the other places in madisonsushi box has more than the standard choices that every place in madison has this is the best place in town for sushi
1,box has been consistently great i love the small space and the owner is very friendly most of the sushi is very affordable we will continue to be regular customers )
1,this spot great food easy going setting come as you are owner is super sweet been here nearly a dozen times and it is consistently good yum
1,i've been reading the other reviews and i'm honestly shocked  i've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it  i liked it better when it was small and unknown but that's because i could enjoy it at my leisure  the owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenonthe food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced the only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor  i've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best chinese foodi have always had at least adequate service on first fridays  the rest of the time the service is as wonderful as the food
1,heard about this guy sarah k went out with on 1212 they didn't quite click but he sounded up my alley we totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices this is how i feel about fate
1,don't know what else i can say that hasn't already been said about fate but here goes the food at fate is like a warm spicy asian orgasm on a plate the martinis send me to another level of heaven johnny chu is a genius and  i will cry if he ever leaves phoenixi think that about covers it
1,was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for fate on here  the whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco but thankfully i've never had a negative experience there and i've been there god only knows how many timesfate is my favorite restaurant  i discovered it late one night (well early morning actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown  i was amazed that they were open that late (i think it was onemaybe two am)  he insisted that i'd be amazed and i was  i have had to wait a few times to get in but usually that was because it was first friday  it's understandable because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown) and it's pretty popular  besides you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait  it's not a big deal  the service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent and the food was brought out ridiculously fast  the crab puffs are to die for and i honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best  the pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good but the spicy cucumber is out of this world  i've tried a number of dishes but i always come back to the spicy saigon with shrimp  i'm glad i don't live nearby or i'd go there all the time  this way it's always a treat when i go
1,love fate love it i love fate so much sometimes i want to take it behind the school and get it pregnanttheir green tea milk is amazing i go cuckoo for it for reals their little mushrooms are so good too oh my god they are like little mini mushrooms if keebler elf's harvested mushrooms these would be it so good if it's your first time trust me: get the crab puffs grab yourself a cool refreshing hulk-alishist green tea milk and go for the hong kong flat noodles so good and what about those little wafer cookies they give you at the end they are like air but better (they have caloriesmaybe they are not like airbut in a perfect world like air)
1,is by far my favorite restaurant everi have been coming to fate for about five years now and never once have i been disappointed with the food or the atmosphere we are normally pretty lucky and we get heather who is super sweet and a great waitress i see reviews about people complaining about the hostess yeah they can be snobby and make life difficult but it is so worth iti would 100% recommend the hot and sour soup it is amazing unfortunately i recently found out it has shrimp powder so i cannot eat it any more another tasty veggie friendly appetizer is the tofu wedges they come with an amazing peanut saucei have had several entrees but always come back to the hong kong flat rice with fried tofu it is so amazing garlicy sauce they have really amazing yellow curry too they might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet but perfectly sothe portions are always great and you honestly cannot beat the atmosphere it is an old house in the historic district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local artists stay away during artwalk though or you will have to wait forever for a table they are open really late on the weekends tooat least give fate a shot once if you don't like it i will let you punch me in the gut
1,must say fate was the only positive thing i gained from an otherwise awful date the food was fantastic i had the green chicken curry it had the perfect mixture of spices and it was not too spicy for a curry dish i wasn't  expecting the curry sauce to be creamy the sauce had a light green split pee hue but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing the meals were fairly priced i believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink$1000-$1200 i enjoyed the artistic ambiance the staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly i have read other reviews about the hostess's being rudeluckily i haven't experienced that even if i had e negative staff experience i would still recommend fate for the food alone
1, this place was soooo good  several veggie options delicious yakisoba  i'm looking forward to trying out their sister-restaurant eastwindwent on a saturday night and it was very busy  i can't wait to go back just not during peak hours
1,place has the best vegetarian sushi roll in town as well as overall good food service alters from unbelievably excellent to non-existent
1,reading the reviews i just had to check out the cherryblossom noodle cafe  i was not disappointedwhat a crazy little place  i went with my brother and a friend  i had the yakisoba (noodles with vegetable and sauce) my brother had the udon noodle soup with tofu and his friend has the tuna  all three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful  we couldn't stop raving about the flavor  who knew noodles could be so magical or tofu so flavorfulthe service was actually quite wonderful  our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like  she also brought us the cool appetizer bread basketbanana bread little cinnamon toasts and rolls  she also helped up each pick a desert :)just an odd little place japanese and italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an eiffel tower decoration and a bright red british phone booth  check it out :)
1,husband & i are addicted to cherryblossom's ramen mr t is japanese & i lived in japan for 4 years so take my word it's authenticthe mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in japan the ramen is hakata style made with a pork broth & may be heavyoily for some people so why not please everybody be sure to ask for "cha shu ramen" to get a few more pieces of pork (extra $)the salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10)shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing  shanghai duck salad and the chicken caesar was perfect not heavily dressed like some "roadhouses" mr t & our daughter loved the eggplant in miso sauce & even the california roll was goodit's said japan took the best of each country's cuisine so there are french pastries german beer italian pasta and indian curries save the banana bread for dessert if you can or get one of their pastries i've never have enough roomif you like good white bread buy one of the pullman loaves on the table by the front door my first extra 20 pounds in japan came from the good bread (no whole grain breads were available 30 years ago)i think it's too small for groups over sixmaybe we'll see you thereadded 111807i think that their menus are not all alike so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive you can still order it (it's posted in japanese on the wall) for the basic ask for "hakata ramen" for extra pork ask for "cha-shu-men" or "cha-shu-ramen"either way there's really not much pork in it that's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad
1,know how everyone has that go-to place to take visiting friends and other out-of-town gueststhis is mine  i've taken my sister and her boyfriend my cousin and her boyfriend several other couples and they've always loved this restaurantlocated in an unassuming little stripmall on camelback (because creative contemporary architecture no longer exists in arizona) the cherry blossom noodle cafe is so tucked away you'd never know it existed  even if you did you'd never know it was so damn goodany how a friend introduced me and i am in love with this place for the following reasons:1 qualitythe food is always excellent  i've never had anything bad here and it's always fresh and tasty  2 varietymy boyfriend and i love this place because he can get real chinese and i don't have to eat forture cookies and water  the theme is noodles so we encompass all asian varieties and italian as well  they also have other asian options such as a japanese bento-box sushi edemame etc  it's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempurabut that's the appeal  great desserts too3 ambiancei always describe it as tokyo disneyland  it's like a japanese take on european provincial  there's a nice brick facade inside nice fixtures big solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables filagree metal light fixtures etc  it's just pleasant and romantic4 staffthey've got that perky-japanese thing down even the non-asian wait staff  they're always smiling and helpful  the girls are cute and perky they're always just really nice peopleso come to the cherry blossom  you can bring out-of-town friends and maybe convince them that that valley isn't all mexican or big-boxchain places  btw since the place is small and intimate small double-dating size groups are good but this is no place for massive groups
1,spicy beef at it's finest their appetizer breads are fantastic as well
1,stars  love this place  already a ton of yelpers have yelped about cherry blossom noodle cafe   i am sure most of them are similar to my love for this placespicy beef noodle bowl
1,got to do the ordering tonight and it was a fabulous meal at cherryblossom noodle cafe i have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic you have traditional noodle dishes both hot and cold from japan along with sushi; pasta dishes from italy and some items from southeast asia there is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate despite their diversity cherryblossom noodle cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of japanese cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtletyfor starters i ordered a california summer roll (vietnamese) for my friend and myself unlike the vietnamese summer roll spiced with mint and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; cherryblossom's version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet sesame seed  soy sauce dip a summer roll contents include shrimp rice vermicelli crab strips and cabbage wrapped with a thin rice paper "tortilla" anyone used to the vietnamese version will see cherryblossom's as probably a little bland but you have to remember the philosophy behind japanese cookingmy friend also had miso soup with his meal unlike the soup yesterday evening he said the miso soup was very goodwith every meal you will also receive a bread basket ( http:cherryblossom-azcomcherry-breadgif ) the basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm french roll; a slice from a dark and sweet blueberry bread; and a crispy butter biscuit there is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyonemain dishesi ordered for my friend grilled orange roughy the orange roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction sides consisted of japanese sticky ricei ordered for myself the beef nanban soup with thin soba (wheat) noodles rather than the udon noodles accompanied by a bowl of japanese sticky rice my friend does not drink but i ordered the rasperry fruit punch a very good drink made from raspberry wine with fruit punch essentially a raspberry wine cooler (but stronger) this drink also had an umbrella "thing" spearing a whole strawberry very good and refreshingi had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little an amaretto laced coffee was brought out the aroma was very enticing would make a coffee drinker out of anyone100% of capacity with 30% asian; 20% hispanic; rest caucasian first time i've been to a restaurant that was packed with no seats left a very popular spotcherryblossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of japanese cuisine no extreme flavors nothing will be extremely spicy salty or sweet this makes it easy to grab a little from this dish and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of eitherthere was something that was a little disconcerting though the state of the men's room for such a highly rated establishment it seemed like no one had checked on the men's room for about two to three hours toilet paper thrown around stains around the wash basin nothing really objectionable but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment this establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it's back-room as well as it's front room won't take anything off but it is highly noticeable consideringand the diners of cherryblossom has to share the same restrooms with tokyo express (right next door) both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group the interesting tidbit is that we both spent more for a worse meal last night at bamboo house amazing my friend said his dishes from the summer roll to the grilled fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him in fact he wanted to go back to cherryblossom the next evening but this is my last night here in the phoenix area sigh(i really think everyone is reviewing cherryblossom under the wrong spelling it's cherryblossom not "cherry blossom" take a look at their sign or their website)
1,place is good  really good  i give it the 3 c's: casual cute and relatively cheap  its a great place to go if everyone your eating with can't decide on what to eat pasta  check  soup noodles  check  sushi  check  the chicken parm and salmon pastas were delicious  can't wait to go back
1,you can get past the worn exterior you are in for a treat  this is easily one of my favorite restaurants in all of phoenix and i often made the trip down from peoria to eat here  the menu is very extensive to say the least i was very impressed by their hard-to-find fusion items such as ika mentaiko pasta (squid with spicy cod roe)  if you have an eclectic appetite i recommend you come here  though i've never tried any of their more typical italian offerings their sushi and asian noodle dishes are delicious  they've also got an assortment of interesting cocktails--saketini anyone
1,yet another michael's and it's a very good one recommended always for those who love crafting michael's is a godsend
1,come here pretty frequently for art and craft supplies whatever michaels doesn't have i just order online from a different retailer some items are pricey but you can still find some good deals if you go all the way to the back of the store you can find interesting clearance items customer service is average my favorite time to visit michaels is when summer is about to end and all the fall and halloween items are set out since i come here often i know where everything i need is however the store could use a new layout
1,love this store are you looking for -a selection of stuffed ratssunglasses shaped like martini glasses or dollar signs or heartscheap pittsburgh mugs or magnetsic light or steelers merchandiseold fashioned candyparty hatsok you get the idea this store is stuffed full of all kinds of things that you will suddenly absolutely need and it's reasonably priced it's also the perfect place to buy some junk to take home to your friends :)
1,is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the strip a wide variety of party favors and pittsburgh paraphernalia
1,is such  fun store  i mean what place can you go into buy a steelers mug a candy necklace and some plates and napkins for a party  want pittsburgh themed merch  they've got it  need party supplies  they've got it  need a bouncy ball  they've got it  you really need to step in here to get the full picture of everything they have to offerbecause it's basically everything  i've come in here looking for one specific item and walked out with twenty non specific items  that's just how it goes here  seriously if you're throwing a themed party looking for unique gift or need steelers merchandise this is the place for you because you'll more than likely find itand walk out with more than you planned on getting  but that's the fun of shopping here
1,freakin' love this place anything you could possibly want they've got it and probably a lot of stuff that you don't want i loved that everyone listed the crazy things they've seen there - they have all of that and so much more 2 gems a friend got while we were there: a giant bottle of sriracha sauce & a fake tattoo sleeve haall i got was a postcard this was the only place i found in the strip district that sold them will definitely be back and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time
1,holiday graduation breast cancer awareness month and other things they have it they have an assortment of things and it's an amazing shop they are real friendly and it's a great place to go to get party items
1,is a great little store  i walked right in off the street and asked if i could have scraps of silk wool cotton leather and polyester  i was met with a ready smile and whisked through the store where one of the workers was gracious enough to assist me and cut small swatches of fabric from the rolls  this store looks well stocked and i really appreciated getting the small swatches for free  this location made it very easy for me to find what i was looking for thank you so very much gene sanes upholstery
1,mom called me so giddy on the phone today i thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery  no  her sofa from gene sane arrived  it made her just as happy  she and i went to gene sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair  the fabric was not inexpensive  some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric some of it is not so special and i am convinced could be found elsewhere for less  however they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process  and my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done theremy parents live in oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator  gene sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building  they brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator  that is such great customer service it is ridiculous  it did fit which is great but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment  this is the kind of stuff that high end places in nyc know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case it was good to know they have the skills to do so  they were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back  these are the kinds of things that make a big difference
1,sanes remade boat cushions for our 28' sailboat interior  incredible craftsmanship and attention to detail the cushions are beautiful they also made coordinating curtains and throw pillows delivered on time (actually 1 week early) and very accommodating to my family who helped pick up the cushions in two waves thank you
1,love love love this store it's a mecca of kooky gifts books cards calendars tshirts jewelry candles pretty much everything you could ask for i've spent over an hour just browsing and around the holidays or birthdays it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get you can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of harry potter hardback books and don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches you'll be hard pressed to not buy anything before you leave
1,the kooky spelling kards unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift the card selection is extensive so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed even better there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself it's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles
1,a great store they stock everything (everything) including: cards hand puppets necklaces books etc kards unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale definitely my favorite store on walnut
1,regret to say that i have walked past this store for four years and never went in that's four years of gifts that i could have found in one place the books staionary gift wrap and kookyfun gifts are all instant inspiration they have way too many things to classify the store or its demographic but if you need something unique and have no idea of what it is just go in and look around you'll find it
1,the best card and gift store in the east end of pittsburgh if not the entire city  even the picky and indecisive card shopper (such as myself) can find plenty of good choices  need a present to go along with that card  you can make a one-stop trip to kards unlimited  there are toys for both kids and adults gag gifts like beer goggles books bath and body products ornaments and what is my favorite to look at funky jewelry  if you're shopping for a literary friend a bunch of the paper collage-style necklace pendants incorporate literary references (why yes i would like one)  even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd the jewelry is beautifulthe aisles can get cramped with people browsing but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see
1,have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back but i've usually come here to browse the books (lots of kurt vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like "while you were out" but with snarky commentary) not only do you have a ton of options here but they're very well curated options one of the very best gift shops around
1,more than just a card shop a very unique store tons of pop culture stuff take your time and look around
1,have to stop myself from stopping here once a week and stocking up on cards i don't yet need great card selection and perfect for gift shopping they literally have something for everyone  i go at least as often as i need a card for some occasion and they always have new things a bit expensive but worth it to support this great store
1,door sign reads "hiring enthusiastic energetic and humorous employees"  so i walk-in immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she "kinda likes it" i couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds i walked through the door super savvy humorous and fun: this is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up i left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk witty comic novels and an irresistible coin pouch it's more than shopping in here it's a whole experience go in get lots for awhile
1,of the few non-people i have purposefully sought out and "liked" on facebook kards unlimited has the highest quality and variety of cards i've ever seen plus wacky tees plus random crap usually found in gift shops at the airport only with infinitely more edge and non-bloated prices i always stop in for a visit when i'm wandering around walnut and i rarely leave empty handed
1,friendly and courteous manager  offers 25% discounts to first time customers
1,amid 18 credits both semesters of my senior year i also managed to find time to do a whole lotta scrapbooking  and this place pretty much carries everything and anything you need  printed papers solid papers pens and markers and pencils stickers die-cuts acid-free adhesives scissors punches and a great selection of albums  i think they have classes too but being the *expert* scrapbooker i am (brushes hair off shoulder) i never checked those out though i'm sure they're a lot of fun  their workroom is well-stocked and (*nerd alert*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoonmiddleton is really close to madisonthe uw campus and convenient to get to  the store is spacious and well laid-out; really a photo-fanatic's dream
1,stafftons of great ideas and products  i came here after a disappointing experience at archivers in the same mall  from now on i'll happily come here instead
1,incredibly detailed company  came on time were diligent in their work and very easy to work with  their rates are very competitive and they even followed up  i'm signed up for automatic periodic cleanings  they even did my solar panels awesome
1,be more impressed with the work done by cloud 9  they gave us a very competitive bid and did an incredible job on our windows  so glad we found these guys
1,company to work with found the website a little confusing but all worked out very happy with results and customer service
1,job  very fast response time via email  inquired on a sunday night they were at my doorstep on tuesday morning  very friendly  fast service  i would recommend to anyone
1,had an excellent experience with sam and cloud 9 they over-delivered on all counts especially customer service their technicians were polite skilled and fast the job was competitively priced and we are very pleased with the work -- windows spotless our screens were so dirty we thought they were brown and barely let light through -- now they are black again very pleased with the results we would recommend them highly and would use their services again
1,am so absolutely disappointed that pegasus closed the name has been around for so long and many people know of it even if they've never stepped foot in it pegasus was an amazing barclub to go to to dance socialize and roam their 3-4 floors the dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing i never had one bad night at pegasus every night there was an amazing adventure the staff was great and the people there were so much fun i met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun i really hope that pegasus comes back because pittsburgh needs it
1,can't find a complaint about this place  drinks are reasonable  only ever seems to be a $1 cover  couches for lounging  pool table  room for dancing if you want to (no one hardly seems to)staff is super friendly  during pride it is a place you can stop into to get a drink cheaper than the beer tents outside
1,up time for an update on the review  still five stars yes but let me expand on it more than my two tiny paragraphs i had priorsince i was there last they have done a remodel a great remodel  it doesn't feel so enclosed now  amazing what a bright color of paint on the wall and some new flooring can do for the way a place feels inside  also big props for finally getting rid of the blinds on the only windows you have in the place (i have a feeling you used them to hide your embarrassment)  new floors and paint are not the only thing that was done for this remodel  remember those scary bathrooms  yeah no more  they have nice clean bathrooms now  the one thing that baffles me is the sink outside the bathrooms  one sink  between the men's and women's bathroom  air dryer no towelsweird but it worksanother great thing was that they moved the pool table to the back  to me it felt like they were deterring you from entering on some nights  i mean what would you think if you walked into a dim lit bar and saw some guys standing there with pool cues  with the moving of the pool table it really does open it up at the front more inviting if you willstaff are still as nice as can be  polite and accommodating$1 cover on most nights to walk in the door  yes there is a $10 minimum if you want to use  your card*if you like karaoke they have an odd little twist on it every first thursday of the month
1,bartenders the happiest happy hour plus attractive tattooed men in undies serving shots tuesday & friday ;)
1,drinks are cheap and the music is pretty good depending on the dj that night its not that expensive to get in either i guess you can kinda say i'm a regular its the only club that i have fun at and the crowd is never rude - drunk of course especially on free draft beer night but never rude in my opinion hahah  its a nicely sized place i've had waaay too much fun at this club they have three bars in total (one in the main room right by the big dance floor) one in 'divas' and another upstairs when they have that open if you wanna get some air they have a nice outside patio toolately i do have to say that the drag shows that i have seen have been kiiiinda boring to be honest but that's not what i normally go there for unless they have special guests  reading the comments i realize people are all like 'this place is shady' and yeah kinda is but i don't expect something fancy unless its downtown *lol*the only thing i don't like is the creepy straight dudes that show up and lurk around especially on fridays they really don't take a hint but that's with every club in my experience sadly xd and in my opinion scorpio is kinda more-so for the guys i'm a queer female and i find it hard to spot the girls who aren't just their for their gay bf i've gone on every day they are open but saturday - my friends say the crowd can be kinda ghettohouse liquor is free on sundays free draft beer on wednesday other specials are normally only 3 bucks which is good in my book  i read on another review that the drinks were weak but like every bar if you tip them well your bartender will treat your right  if your looking for something fun to do with no frills and no pretentious people this is the place
1,and sundays are the best nights i thinkive been going to this club since i was 18 now 35 its a guaranteed good time :) they have great specials on some nights its all you can drink draft sometimes its all you can drink well drinks or vodkawith admission of course which has almost always been $10 if you love drag queens check out sunday nights its the most fun :) djs have changed over the years i dont know who is the dj now but i know there will always be some good music to dance my a** off to :) been going here for years and will probably go for many many more proud this is one of the oldest gay clubs in nc :) go scorpio
1,love the cash it is one of the few bars that have a smoking patio that you can drink onwe have donated a lot of stuff to raffle off for charity events at the cash they always have a great turnoutthe crowd is extremely diverse the drinks are good and cheap and the bar staff is very friendly
1,matter your persuasion there are good times to be had here  the people watching is spectacular and everyone is super friendly just watch out for the 70+ year old () tranny who looks just amazing because she will drag your unwilling ass onto the dance floor to teach you to two-step
1,is a great place to have funa great variety of music mostly country but good dancing country from the two step to the "neon moon" song dance (cuz i don't know the name of that dance lol) to coordinated dances to certain songs and then just shaking your bootay to madonna or something like thatnice big dance floor and a good amount of seatingsmoking area out the side doors that's new where you can bring your drinks nice touch since that new law came inbartenders are really nice and the drinks are strong  the draft beer seems to get you drunker than normal for some reason not sure whygreat place even to bring straight people my friends always seem to have a blast when they gojust really needs better parking but that's not too much of an issue
1,the fact that san diego cannot support a lesbian clubbar i was very impressed with this unpretentious place we showed up on a rainy friday night place was a hoppin a little bit o' butch a little bit o' femme a few trannys sprinkled in as well as some music and a great and active dance floor i despise country music- but it sure was fun watching these folks do a little two step and beyond (damn they were good) they did also play a little hip-hoptop 40 to mix things up didn't spot any attitude here everyone was friendly smiling laughing and having a good time ourselves included
1,place is awesome my favorite lesbian bar in town
1,really do keep meaning to go for free line dance lessons  good prices no cover excellent happy hour lots of crowd variety  fun place to meet up with my friends
1,been in once but i loved it this bar was one of the factors on moving down to this area you will see me there alot love the people and how nice the employees are both indoor and outdoor seating i came from seattle and this bar is way better than any of the lesbian clubs on capitol hill
1,have to say for us ladies who love ladies there aren't many options for bars  that being said i think the cash is pretty swell  they aren't trying to be something they're not (zgirl club take notes) they're not pretentious and there's never a waitcover to get in  the bartenders are chill and remember you even if it's been a long time  i love kat and the other bartender (name unknown to me) with the lovely silver hair who always asks "what'll it be babe"  the music isn't exactly my style but they do throw a few booty-shakers in amongst the country ballads  i love watching the dance floor as most of the ladiesgentsothers know how to cut a rug  they have a large outdoor patio for the folks who enjoy smoke and the drinks are cheap:)  love what you do don't change a thing
1,new favorite bar in phoenix dress anywhere from casual to fancy and you fit in two step hip hop slow dancing line dancing they have everything the bar tenders are incredible and take care of you well tip em big
1,very hard to be unbiased since this is my saturday night spot for a year and a half now the bar: i enjoy the employees attitude the new country with some top 40 cupid shuffle some throwback songs and fairly priced drinks in this decent sized dive bar for smokers there's a large back patio area an atm is available in the darts room parking is in front the back or at food city the cash has supported charities held drag shows and threw themed nights like the most recent black out party and  they also host poker games dance lessons and of course karaoke for busy nights they have 3 bar tenders serving 2 in the front and 1 in the rear the crowd: if you're visiting or new transplant compared to flashy los angeles hipster seattle and melting pot nyc's lez scene (to name a few cities) i've noticed that this place has lots of butch lesbians about an even number of femmes tomboys androgynous and a small handful of ultra femmes for the most part everyone's friendly you'll see a wide age range here along with some straights gay boys etc i've also noticed a trend the cash's bathrooms are never nasty and are always stocked with tp and paper towels lolcome by grab a drink get your 2 step on or twerk and grind or just wiggle around at the cash the cheer's of phoenix's lesbian population and have a great time :)
1,the word from a trusted friend who recently went:verylatinit was yummy and funawesome musicfun dancinggood crowdon a scale of 1-1011
1,first time i went to karamba's it was for pride i went for after hours and it was amazing i paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar there were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom when we went deeper into the club the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor there were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section the dance floor was packed with men grinding up on men with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace there's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor then there's the outside patio there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs benches and tables sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at since that weekend i've been a regular there i'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some friday or saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around if you do pull me away from my friends and say hi hope to see ya'll there
1,music and tons of fun love the music fridays is mainly for "cheros" akaguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music notreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going saturdays is hip hopreggaeton and house music which is the main day it gets popin  after 2 it turns 18and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it note: karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind ofplace  it kind of reminds me of a club i used to go to in juarez except with alot moreeye candy  the atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle itsmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impressanyone  from experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its truebathrooms: yea they're kinda small but um im there to party if your worried about thebathrooms lmao please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you  prices: people say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap if yourhard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute latino will buy your drinks for u duh
1,doesn't matter what anybody says about dance night clubs you have to see for yourself because this club is absolutely incredible they have an amazing sound system and laser light this is definitely where i would want to be on the weekend if i'm looking for a dance club this club is so good it has received the best of phoenix award several years in a roll none of the latino dance clubs have survived only this club because the owner knows what he's doing and provides great music and entertainment you have to go stop in and see this place if you're looking for a latino club this is really the only place in arizona to go  also the club has a food taco stand outside which is good and also an amazing outdoor patio that's absolutely beautiful it also has there are areas in the club that are sort of tucked away where you can sit with friends and drink and have a really great time i am lmao at all these little young tweakers who are posting bad reviews because they had a bad time give me break they have no clue what a really good dance club is all about and their one time bad experience has nothing to do with the quality of a club maybe if they weren't so high they could have enjoyed the club lol
1,best bar  everyone is welcome bored with the usual join the interesting set at c7 friday night's drag show starts about 10:30 and daveena ross is an elegant hostess bring $1s to help them fund college or make-up if you like clones stay away if you like humanity come on down
1,haven't had a night out like this since living in sf these ladies had so much vibrance and personality the show started slightly after 10:30 and i went in on a friday to celebrate a friends birthday it was worth the wait drinks were cheap but the performance was not the dive bar ambiance gave it a very comfortable feel don't expect anything fancy except from the ladies small parking lot but lots of places to park nearby though kudos to the staff we had a great night :)
1,rocks best place in cenpho to grab a spot at the bar patio or table i say that cause there is always room it's a shame the place is rarely packed because this very cool neighborhood bar has a lot going for itgreat bartenders a supper friendly owner and the best drink prices north of van buren there is always a drink special and lots to look at with all the tv's and music videos a few old school pinball machines darts a big stage and a pool tablei like going for some of the drag shows this is the type of place with newbies and the old standards like celia miss ebony and phedrai think ther is karaoke a few times a week and strippers on saturday nights i have to get back for that on my last visit we were shocked because even though the parking lot was empty there was a fun lively crowd inside we found out that alot of people walk over from around the hood and from the huge uber-gay apartment complex next doori dont live close enough to walk and i dont drink and drive so i dont get in as often as i would like to but the last time i was there was 5 stars thanks guys for making me feel welcomejv
1,such a great time here plazma has a dive bar feel (as least when i went) cocktails were cheap and strong the bartender was so nice and friendly and worked his butt off all night - he did a great jobi like the little outdoor seating area and there's a good amount of parking overall very chill very nice
1,been going to plasma for a few years now met some amazing friends this place is really awesome it really is the gay cheers
1,neighborhood bar but not too small like some of the other neighborhood bars very friendly bartenders and patrons we are not bar types but enjoy going here once in a while to play pool or just chill out
1,a friendly neighborhood bar offering great happy hours and live entertainment several nights of the week plus an excellent sunday brunch  be sure to check out the freaky fridays shows featuring celia putty each friday night

1,had planned on going to the rhythm room which is directly across the street but they were still charging a full cover at midnight and just wanting to have a late-night cocktail we took our hard-earned cash to friends  just as we walked in a drag show was ending which was a treat  only wishing we had gotten there sooner we sat down and ordered drinks  i was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have  not feeling too adventurous in that area i ordered a ketel one citroen on the rocks  generously poured i don't remember the price but i am sure it wasn't too steep  as the night went on the place thinned out and soon the wife and i were the only two people in the place  the bartender anthony was a joy to talk to  we ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go  i would go back just to have a bartender that good hell the place is called friends and i'd be his friend any day he was full of conversation and laughs  at the end of the night he called us a cab and made sure i didn't leave anything behind in my ketel one haze  he nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record i left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the eveningthis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town  it was a great way to end a great night outalso i would totally wear a friends t-shirt if they have them  i love the logo
1,was sold on 672013  the new name is zorfs  friends was a great place to socialize drink eat and enjoy  zorfs is following the same agenda while adding new energy and apparent increasing clientele  check out zorfs on yelp and add your comments  the owner kenny is in the establishment much of the time  he welcomes your comments and suggestions personally
1,one time at apollos some gay dudes asked my friend and i if we were real women i knew i should have waxed my mustache before going out that night but never mind that snafu- i always feel like a diva herethe girls and i have been to apollos a handful of times for karaoke and i'm always a drunken mess every time i leave there well i certainly can't handle my liquor but the drinks are poured well here they have cheap cheap drinks and the first  time i was there i think the pink panther martinis did it for me they were only $4 toogreat place to gather a bunch of friends for karaoke yes its a gay bar but the coolest one i've always met great guys there they are never interested in me but they are always so nice and willing to sing a duet with me the karaoke host is always fun not a mic hog like some places my only complaint is that my gay friends like to sing lots of show tunes boring there are definitely some great performers here and but most are here to have a good time so don't feel like you need to belt like whitney houston to come here my favorite things about apollos are:1) free fresh popcorn best thing to munch on after you've had a lot to drink2) the ladies room never has a line because its mainly gay dudes that frequent this placei love apollos
1,neighborhood feeling the bartender nikki is the best hands down very attentive and personable bartender not phony like a lot of valley bartenders nikki keep it up girl
1,this bar cheap strong drinks very friendly staff and its clean the patio is awesome and full of great conversation
1,i'm feeling low and looking for a great atmosphere to cheer me this is where i go great drinks and the staff is so very nice throw a little karaoke in for fun and this is most definetly the place to be
1,wife and i have visited st anthony's chapel three time so far and every time the experience is a moving one  i would recommend the guided tour  the amount of relics contained in the chapel is amazing  if you a person of faith this is a wonderful place
1,church is absolutely beautiful both from the inside and outside stumbled across this by chance when i took a wrong turn and visited it to seek solace when a friend passed away beautiful interiors with stain glass and candles it has a peaceful aura that really comforted me  it's beautiful and lit up at the night and opposite the church are stunning views of the grand city of pittsburgh
1,have been a student of the true buddha school most of my life the school is global with the main headquarters in redmond washington i recently moved to charlotte and was so pleased there was a temple here the people here are some of the nicest i've met the services are all mostly conducted in chinese and the attendees are also mostly chinese so it can be very disconcerting for non-chinese speakers don't be intimidated culturally there are differences but everyone is good people :) on a day-to-day basis the english is limited but we definitely have quite a few english speakers dotted within if you have questions or want to learn more please feel free to call or stop by and try and make an appointment with an english speaker we are usually there on sundays regular weekly service (usually group cultivation + meditation) is from 11-1 you can feel free to come by and observe and we can try and answer any questions you have before or afterwards and you would be more than welcome to stay for lunchthere are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to english printed words only get you so far the best thing to do is to track down an english-speaker and ask everything you've ever wanted to ask there are no stupid questions only "teachers" who may not know the best answer :)currently and at least through the end of the year (2014) we have a dharma class being taught in english from 1:30 to 3 it gets into some of the nitty gritty of buddhism so if you are a beginner i'd recommend talking to someone before jumping into class either way anyone and everyone is welcometbs is open to everyone chinese or not and of any religious backgroundour spiritual leader is living buddha lian sheng our dharma and our practice encompasses all buddhist schools of mahayana hinayana and mostly vajrayana while other temples and societies may practice differently we all believe in the same basic precepts of the four noble truths and the eightfold path
1,consider myself a soul food connoisseur and when i tell you this place was the best it was really the best  i have tried every soul food joint in charlotte and around the united states and consider this one to be at the top of my list  where should i begin  we took our family of five here after church  the children all ordered the fried wings and loved them  my husband ordered the meat loaf loved it  i ordered the smoked pork chops loved it  between the five of us we had green beans sweet potatoes mac and cheese turnips rice and gravy and corn muffins  they were all extra great with a special asterisk by the mac and cheese and sweet potatoes  we continued on with the sweet potato pie and the cherry cheesecake  excellent excellent  extra "woo woo" that they do accept credit cards  the price was reasonable because it included everything  our bill for five came up to $5200  that averages to $1040 per person that included our wonderful sweet tea and dessert  i will continue to return here  menu varies from day to day so call before you go  i can't wait to see if they fry fish or serve liver and onions
1,can't complain when i arrive early for lunch my fav sweet potatoes are soooooo good as ifs the cabbage however if i arrive after 12:301:00 the sweet potatoes are gone needless to say i've learned that lesion the hard way suffice it to say your choices are better for meats and  veggies with early arrival i an a happy camper today
1,jcc has a great gym i highly recommend going to lyn's zumba classes which are free to all members she has a strong dance background and she's very energetic and easy to follow
1,wonderful place to workout and swim - a true vibrant center of culture and jewish life in charlotte
1,family and i love everything the jcc has to offer i use the gym pool and basketball courts quite often and they are always clean and very well maintained
1,grove is the church where i vote and where my daughter plays soccer my church http:wwwbranchchurchorg is in a rented facility and has no place to do baptisms hg let us use their facility on a friday night complete with sound guys i think that's really cool
1,is my home church and has been for 15 years so of course i love it our pastor is an amazing speaker my favorite part being that he tells he truth and stands up for it even when he knows he will get a lot of hate mail and a lot of offended people who will leave the church to look for somewhere else where the pastor doesn't step on your toes and hold you accountable i wouldn't call our music style quite contemporary in that when someone says "contemporary christian music" i immediately think of chris tomlin brandon heath etc and it's more of a gospel sound if you have heard of the brooklyn tabernacle choir our music is pretty much exactly the same we do have a lot of energy in not only our worship but also some during the sermon we have wonderful ministries for people of all ages in church out in the community and around the world with our great missions department the most common drawback for people is how big the church is with over 8000 members (i of course don't know exacts) and plenty who are not yet members it can be overwhelming for someone used to smaller congregations however we offer a shuttling service for satellite parking at both providence and country day school if you want to skip out on the crowded parking lot and the bus drops you off right at the front door of our sanctuary also if you feel that you can't get connected because of he huge crowd in services here's where our said ministries on campus comes in we have many different options with sunday school classes you can attend not just by age or "single" or "coues but also different subjects (which i don't really know off the top of my head) so come check us out although we are a great place to worship i know it might not be exactly what everyone wants well what can i say i love my church
1,church very diverse the pastor tells it like it is  the choir and music is awesome   if i have to find a complaint it would be sometimes its hard to find a sit because people save seats but the ushers usually work it out
1,a wonderful church the pastor is straight to the point and is very honest about his own struggles in life  he uses the pulpit to preach jesus and steers clear of politics he doesn't mince words about biblical topics the people are friendly and the choir is amazing
1,filled church; outstanding music  the easiest (and not anywhere close to the whole story) description would be "pentacostal lite"  you're not going to see snakes or much in the way of speaking in tongues but if you are interested in a church where jesus is the center focus and worship is an active experience then this is the place for you  our family took a long time getting to visit here but after going to many of the placid dried up services at other places we found this to be home  loran livingston is senior pastor and gifted teacherspeakerminister  the choir and musicians are world class and passionate performers
1,real deal  if you like your catholicism quiet and personal with a little organ music and perhaps some donuts after mass then st mary's downtown phoenix is the parish for youoriginally built in 1881 it is the oldest catholic church in phoenix  staffed by the franciscans and located in the heart of downtown phoenix  the masses are traditional thoughtful and beautiful  the choir is phenomenal and there is an innate sense of family there-even as a guest
1,you are looking for a classic catholic church in phoenix this is it st mary's basilica has a beautiful sounding choir wonderful priests and a historically catholic feel with architecture and structure i think it has something to do with the fact that pope john paul ii visited this basilica years ago for world youth day i've been going to st mary's basilica for years ironically enough father vince who is a priest at st mary's basilica used to be the priest at st isidore's in danville california which was the church i went to when i was growing up during the holidays i make sure i attend mass at st mary's basilica there's something about the architecture music and mass that makes this a perfect church for those times however it's also a great church for sunday mass around 7 years ago my sister married her husband at st mary's basilica  and i was lucky enough to be the maid of honor the wedding was a full mass and made it such a special day for my sister her husband myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony there isn't much more i can say about st mary's basilica in this review but i will end this by saying that each mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending but be sure to visit this church and attend a mass so see if it's right for you
1,is one of the few things that i enjoyed in phoenix  actually there is nothing else except the baseball stadium and lots of spring training stadiaotherwise phoenix sucksa city   i think not
1,visiting in-laws for christmas i attended midnight mass at st mary's basilica in downtown phoenix and it was one of the first times i understood why it is said that catholics "celebrate" the massthe basilica is a beautiful piece of spanish colonial architecture run by franciscan friars crowned with bell towers palms and stained glass windowsthe christmas altar was lit with candles and bursting like a heart in love with the reds of dozens of poinsettiasmidnight mass lasted until 2am but was so rapt with happiness that few seemed to mind or notice instead the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense it was like a holy party with all of creation joining in the celebration of its father son and holy ghostthe mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken there were traditional carols latin chants and pieces of handel's messiah the choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one powerthe celebrant was father vincente mesi whose beautiful crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of christ's birth as well as the gospel reading from the pulpitby 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of phoenix the bells sang the happy triumph the surprise victory of love and meekness over the pride and might of the worldmany though no doubt not all felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding many though no doubt not all walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy those who did were at least for a moment transformed by this eternity--this holy party which is christmas
1,love this church i found it before i moved to phx and saw that pope john paul went here how many churches have been visited by the pope in america not many made my three wishes and love that the door is always open to pray also the stained glass windows are amazing i go here after my downtown hospital rotations or if i'm in the area i also like that they have afternoon mass at 12 and a mass for the deaf how great is that love this place a must see phx jem
1,are staying downtown and had decided to go to sunday mass in st mary's basilica one of the oldest churches in phoenix  from the outside it's an mission style stucco exterior while inside all the alters are adorned with statues of the saints and the pipe organ in the upper balcony is absolutely wonderful to hear  mass was very old school in that it was sung from start to finish  it lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes  considering the church is downtown there were a large congregation present and not everyone looked like a tourist  it's a beautiful old church worth taking a look at
1,is the most wonderful church i've ever been to the masses are beautiful and the people are friendly and welcoming  i can't imagine going anywhere else
1,churchalways open be sure to look closely at the remarkable stain glass
1,attended mas here last sunday and so happy i did sunday before last i was dragged to mass at the franciscan renewal center and it was not joy it was far too liberal -- it's simply not my preference as a catholicwalking towards the cathedral you just feel a sense of history -- it's simply beautiful i adore so many patron saints so i love all the decorated alters choir is simply amazing times keep changingbut i prefer to celebrate catholic mass in a more traditional manor i attend st francis xavier and holy trinity greek orthodox church on a regular basis but will definitely attend mass here more often
1,you are in the phoenix downtown convention area and you are catholic you owe it to yourself to visit this catholic church it is a church like no other its beauty is breath taking from the outside and when you step into this holy cathedral you get a sense of belonging and feel the spirit overcome your body it is a sacred place and an experience like no other
1,the hell yelp don't got swish awww hell nawwwhehe that's my ghetto supa starok so swish is actually the first shabu shabu place in vegas i looked when i moved here this was the only place i needed something to get my shabu shabu fix taken care of shabu shabu is when you get a hot pot of water or broth and you "swish your meatveggiesseafood" to cook it and eat i have this thing with interactive food i love to play with food "be the bologna sandwich" so you come into this strip mall not knowing this place is here i'm sorry but this place was not easy to find but yo support yo local businesses the table setup is kinda cool it's like a square counter with everyone having their own seperate hot pot it's a very simple menu veggies meat kobe or seafood you get a healthy sizeand a hungry size they need like hulk size but then again this explains so many skinny asians you can get a variety of apps from edamame seaweed salads miso soup but the good stuff comes in 2 forms shabu shabu formor sukiyaki form for dessert - have some mochi ice cream and rub yer full belly mmmmm so this place did place in best of las vegas staff picks 2006 if you get lost it's on sahara near buffalonow i need to find a japanese curry house
1,place is hella badass i eat here every time i go to vegas because it's way off of the strip and i don't have to deal with drunk tourists don't be intimidated by the "make it yourself" portion the servers are crazy nice and help you out the whole time i was "that guy" and screwed up my order about 4 times before figuring out what i wanted and the servers were accommodating and gracious the entire evening how can you beat great food and watching crazy asian tv they were playing some show that's a mix between mxc and american gladiators so intense i love this place
1,of my all time favorite places to eat in vegas  way off the strip it's best to come to swish when it's not peak eating hours  the first time i came here i arrived right about the time they opened  this turned out to be a good thing  by the time my friends and i were finishing up with our leisure lunch the place was filling up quickly and nicelythe layout is waaay cool  a large u shaped counter sits in the middle of the room  sitting out the outer edges your server will provide you with a gas grill and give you your choice of shabu shabu or sukiyaki  or loosely translated - wet (soupy) or dry meal (grilled)  you get to 'swish' your food yourself  if you give a stupid enough look your server might be as sympathetic as mine and help you out with the cooking  luckily i've done this before so no stupid looks here  at least not in regards to getting my cook onthe average plate is slightly price but it is well worth it  the owner and staff are awesome and friendly  i try to hit up swish whenever i get the chance  you should too
1,only one way to describe this place perfect ok so no decor and yeah you cook it yourself i don't care i love itthere is a happy hour but grr i think it ends at 5 so grab a bottle of sake order the kobe beef in the sukiyaki and enjoy lifethe tofu the edamame everything it is pricey yes i wish it wasn't
1,was the first real restaurant i ate at when i first moved here  then i ended up here 3 times in 2 weeks i hear alot about price but if you want quality you gots ta pay for it  that said the meat is good color marbling  the kobe chuck is definitely the star here a bit darker in color but the texture and flavor is hard to describe other than it's yummy for my tummy  for the not so adventurous there is the prime rib cuts a bit smaller but still good  they could be a bit more generous on the veggies but then again i'm not here for the veggiesit's all about the beef the key to good shabu is the secret sauce ponzu you have to make your own lil sauce concoction with ponzu base garlic green onions nanami togarashi (japanese pepper sprinklesask for it) be generous with it and a bit of chili paste  add to the broth tooless the ponzu  i'm not a big fan of the sesame sauce but tasty too  try not to overcook the meat 10 to 12 seconds is all it takes can't forget to mention angie and marina the 2 tallest asian girls ever very nice and friendlybut watch out 50% beer sake 9 to 10pm and they just may have a drink with you til next time good eating
1,went to swish for the first time last week and it was so amazing that i returned 2 days later and joined yelp to tell everyone about it they have 2 portion sizes one is healthy (smaller) and one is hungry but the great thing is that if you do get the smaller portion you can add on just a little bit more at any time if you're still hungry the place is pretty small the counter is in a big u shape and your little hot pot is in front of you on a counter the staff is really friendly and take good care of you happy hour is from 9pm till 10pm and that is 50% off half of sake makes me happy i had the kobe chuck and it is amazing sliced so thin it almost falls apart the chicken is amazing too i'm just going to go ahead and say everything is amazing they also have adorable bento boxes for lunch they are vegetarian friendly which is very nice and the prices aren't that high the kobe chuck dinner is around $16 my only gripe with the place is they play some cheesy radio station all day
1,good place for shabu shabu  if you are coming from the strip make sure your cab driver takes the highway it is much faster  i had the kobe chuck and it was very flavorful with good veggies on the side too  this place is a nice retreat from the crowded strip restaurants if you want to get away for a while and is the only shabu place near the strip as far as i know
1,love this restaurant one of my favorites everyone gets their own hot pot the concept works very excited to go there again i've already recommended it to most of my friends i wish there was one closer to me
1,obsessed with this place it's so nice to have incredibly tasty healthy fresh food when dieting (or just in general )  the $1399 kobe chuck lunch special is hands down one of the best food bargains in this city  incredible i also have to give major props to my favorite server there for always accommodating my obnoxious and bizarre food requests today he made me a custom plate of low carb veggies (mushrooms asparagus and cabbage) instead of the usual mix very cool of them to say the least also have to add they have alternate noodle options if you don't like udon - just ask prices are awesome and the servers will bend over backwards for you highly recommend especially for lunch 
1,place is now on my list of "i don't care if i ate this earlier this week i'll eat this again tonight" foods  yes i know that's not a very memorable or catchy list but it gets the point across  i think i have to get my sukiyaki fix every couple weeks or else i start to crave itwhen ordering your meal you're presented with several options: the type of meatchickenseafood the portion size and shabu shabu or sukiyaki style  once those details are out of the way food is brought to you almost immediately  the waitress gets your stove going for you and you're off  your choice of meat is brought out to you along with an assortment of vegetables that include onions green onions asparagus carrots mushrooms and cabbage  you also get some udon noodles and a bowl of rice  additional condiments are chili paste radish and green onion that you can add to your brothi've had the shabu shabu here before but it wasn't something that i'll be eating again anytime soon  the broth seemed quite plain and didn't seem to do much more than boil my veggies and meat  the sukiyaki however has won me over  i love the sweetsoy sauce flavor of the broth itself as well as the fact that the veggies and meat do take on the flavor of the sauce  bonus tip: checkout the front table by the entrance that has business cards and newspapers  one of the newspapers is a korean newspaper and on the cover there is a coupon for swish that gets you 10% off your meal ;)
1,food and great service  i highly recommend going here
1,great fusion concept delicious food and courteous service we're looking forward to our return
1,place finally opened up and it was definitely worth the wait the restaurant isn't very busy since not a lot of people know that it is open yet the decor is modern the music is fun the place is very clean and they also have 3 big screen tvs the restaurant is asian fusion mixing thai chinese and korean dishes having never been to a restaurant like this the staff  was very friendly and helpful in explaining the different things on the menu my friend and i decided to try the shabu shabu (hot pot) the grill and we ordered pineapple fried rice as one of our sides every thing on the menu is very reasonably priced for the shabu shabu you get to pick out 2 sauces to cook your food in we picked coconut milk and the spicy chinese ones you also get to pick out the different  tray of meats and vegetables you want to cook in them each tray of food is individually priced but very reasonable we picked chicken beef mushrooms and a separate tray of veggies every thing was very fresh we also picked korean short ribs for the grill we had a lot of questions for our waitress she helped us cook all our food and came to check on us several times in case we had any additional questions for her  for dessert we tried the mango sticky rice it was very refreshing i was very impressed at how good the food was and how much food we got for the price we paid i would definitely recommend this place to every one it is a hidden treasure
1,driven past this place more than a handful of times waiting for it to say "open"luckily it finally is i'm so glad i've kept my eye on this place because it was exceptional although it hasn't had it's "grand opening" the service was exceptional they answered all my questions we had shabu which included original broth and spicy oriental broth with:- beef- scallops- tofu- vegetables- extra enoki mushroomsif you do come please ask for their peanut sauce it is delicious and flavorful and my mouth is watering because of it i will definitely be back
1,food friendly staff pumpkin curry is freaking delicious
1,food wonderful modern feel inside fantastic people we will be back if it is your first time just let them know and they will help you :)
1,had the pleasure of dining at shabu grill last week with my family it's now my favorite place for shabu shabu great ambience unique shabu broth great tasting food definitely coming back soon1 must try the coconut and lemon grass shabu broth 2 love that you get to pick out your plate of beef seafood and wonderful varieties of asian vegetables; they had tong hao my must have for shabu3 pad thai and pumpkin chicken curry were awesome4 paula the server were so patient to explaining to people who have never had shabu5 do try the mango sticky rice great way to end your lunch
1,shabu in the neighborhood & to my surprise it was really good korean bbq & shabu
1,my friend and i got curious with shabu grill with all the good yelp reviews and i must say everyone is right love this place everything is pretty much a la carte my friend and i decided to do asian style and share our food together i did the shabu grill and she did the japanese hot poti really love the concept of this place pretty much all the meats and veggies are prepared and you can grab as much as you want from the fridge everything is lined up and organized with all the meats and veggies be warned it is not all you can eat they charge you per plate average cost for a plate was 495$ for beef but the way my friend and i eat we racked up alot of plates and not even pay attention to how much we spentthe food is great they have an array of sauces you can choose from i didn;t really use any of it because i already like the natural flavors of the meat i was grilling and as for my friend she loved her japanese hot potfor those of youhave like authentic japanese you will be discouraged because the hot pot was not japanese at all it was more chinese but we till loved it thoughi felt this palce was really unique because it was asian food fusion with all the other countries the restaurant was a combination of japanese thailand koreanthey are still in the works in getting the place together they are adding a bar and tapas coming sooni really love this place the food is great and the cleanliness of the place is excellent as wellthe staff is great they fill your water up constantly and really friendlyi am a new loyal customer of shabu grill and will definitely return heretry now you will not be disappointed
1,a fan$699 for bento box lunch  and it's tasty  you pick 1 of like 8 difft curries [ i got the pumpkin bc it was difft and was delicious] white or fried rice salad or egg roll  it needed more spice for me but i like it hawt but they do have like 6 diff sauces on the table and you can heat it up that waythe thai salad is awesome and big enough to share peanut dressing is to die for and the crunchy tofu is just right it also has chicken and shrimp on iti didn't try the shabu but i'm going back at dinner time one night to do this best little neighborhood gem i've found in a whiledecor is pretty sweet too parking was super easy and they had kaskade on  hours are 11 am to 10 pm couple of tv's inside but no sound on  waitress was very attentive as well
1,was the soft opening great selection and fresh good choice of broths and reasonable prices
1,fondue only opened a few nights ago and they are already off to a great start we were so impressed with the variety of the menu and ended up ordering two different broths both of which were spicy and delicious we ordered a ton of ingredients but the pork dumplings and grass-fed beef were by far favorites at our table we were lucky enough to have chefowner johnny chu stop by our table probably three times just to chat and see what we liked and what we didn't a great experience overall
1,had been to tien wong hotpot in chandler (t-spot) about ten times and had high hopes for shabu fondue it delivered and then some the portion sizes tripled and the quality was identical as the old location my only complaint was that it was uncomfortably hot in there needed to be 5-10degrees cooler to offset all the steaming hot pots this place remains awesome
1,amazing date night experience the food was high quality and fresh everything was delicious we ordered the ying yang pot(choice of 2 broths) with the ma long(spellling) spicy and the coconut curry both were fantastic but the spicy one is pretty spicy our proteins were shabu beef new york beef pork belly and shrimp we also got some veggies and noodles chef and owner was a really cool guy and stopped of at our table a few times throughout the night you can tell how passionate he is about the ingredients he uses this would be a great place for the whole family imo you can teach your kids about the foods and they can watch them cook we are already planning our next trip
1,went to shabu fondu with a group and we had a great experience the staff was friendly accomodating and helpful the food was great and it was fun to cook it yourself the menu is rather extensive and it would be easy to eat vegetarian here they served there water with some cucumber and that was also tasty the wife and i had the curry and shabu beef broccoli bok choy and rice noodles it was a winning combo
1,discovered shabu when i worked in sacramento where there are several restaurants serving this style of food but until now you haven't been able to get it in phoenix which i why i was thrilled to hear that this location had opened and close to my house to bootfor those who've never had it shabu is an asian style of fondue sometimes referred to as hot pot instead of oil cheese or chocolate each table has its own warmer to which they bring you a large bowl of soup broth in which you cook your food you can even order two types of broth that come in a large container that is split down the middlewe ordered two the base house broth for the kids and a slightly spicier lemongrass broth for us we then ordered a mix of items to cook including beef chicken tofu broccoli dumplings crab scallops and noodles when they bring the items they tell you how long each one should cook and its helpful to arrange them by cooking time starting with the longest that take 3 to 4 minutes and working down to those that take only a minute or lessonce you have all of your food the fun begins my kids had a blast deciding what to try cooking their own food and eating with chopsticksservice was excellent our server stopped by several times to see how we were doing and to adjust the heat on our hot plate the manager (owner) stopped by a few times as well to make sure we were having a good time and we assured him that we definitely werethe atmosphere was fun as well it's decorated sort of like a club and they were playing a great mix of tunes including stuff that we used to go out dancing to in the 80s and 90s definitely a bright lights big city type of place the manager even mentioned that they have a dj in the thai restaurant next door on friday and saturday nightswhile we had a great time as a family this would also be a blast for an adult night out on the town if you've never had shabu or you've been missing it in phoenix you definitely want to head on out to shabu fondue for an enjoyable time
1,delicious very friendly service as wellgot 2 broths thai and chinese with 2 meats (shabu beef and pork loin) 2 vegetables (shiitake mushroom and napa cabbage) 1 house special firm tofu and oval noodles
1,well done   service food was amazing i'm coming back for sure  the atmosphere is beautiful with trendy art work   you will leave happy and full  and guarantee you'll be back   i've eaten at shabu fondue restaurants all over and i have to say this is one of the best
1,was amazing staff was attentive the owner came by twice atmosphere is modern and sheek my fiance' and i were really impressed
1,to have a shabu place in phx fresh healthy food great service  and lots of different sides and proteins to choose from as an la native i was thrilled to find this style of cuisine on my door step
1,this place and will be back again so nice to have a new different choice in the neighborhood  the staff was really nice and showed us how to order add items in our hot pot and made suggestions from the grill  the grill items are like sushi or tapas in that they are small economically priced portions and you can try a bunch  we went nuts had a beer and still had a very reasonable check  our 8-yr old boy was with us too and they were great to him
1,this place the first place i can find in az has real asian style bbq skewer it's a small and cozy place good for date night and girls night to just enjoy the food since they open late till 12pm or 2am we only try bbq last night and the taste is indeed perfectly delicious most of other bbq place either make them too salty or sweet or sour etc just doesn't taste right but in here you don't have to worry about it at allstaff are very polite and friendly give out good recommendation a very nice dine-in experiencewill come back and try their hot pot or bento next time
1,been this place for dinner for a couple of times and i pretty like this place prices are pretty acceptable and foods are pretty delicious in this restaurant  lamb kebab is absolutely my favorite from the menu and mini hot pot is my second best choice i also usually order three orders of onigiri instead of steam rice if i am tired of steam rice i am glad that i found this new opening eastern restaurant that pretty fit to my taste
1,a hot pot restaurant that fill me up without emptying my wallet great environment for small group of people to try out their hot pot was told this is the place for great hot pot and bbq was very happy about the experience with this restaurants the owner couple are very young energized and friendly although the background music is a little loud but i was focusing on the food too much don't go there after 7:00pm to mid-night over weekend unless you want to hang out with young chinese crowd they did offer different sauce for the hot pot but you have to ask for it my favorite is the the seafood hot pot
1,decided to come back here to try other dishes and i must say i was not disappointed this time was better than the first timethis time i had the spicy beef hot pot which i absolutely love i actually prefer this than the seafood hot pot it has more flavor and the spice level was on point we also ordered the lamb chicken and beef skewer let's say with every bite you have a burst of delicious flavor in your mouth i highly recommend it
1,am actually a traveler i wish i could stay here as long as possible or maybe they could open another store in boston service is good i like the girl a lot and food is very well presented and prepared very fresh i can tell i ordered seafood hotpot and my friend ordered spicy beef hotpot i would strongly recommend seafood hotpoti will visit az again in a year maybe 2 i will definitely come by again
1,place is great the food is really quite good it has something for everyone for the not so adventurous eaters you can go with the yakitori or beef and for the very adventurous there are lots of options the hot pots are quite good we split a spicy beef and got items off the bbq menu our favorite was the cabbage so good also the beef yakitori and jalepenos were awesome with a sweet delicious sauce i definitely recommend trying this place out
1,atmosphere and nice staff the food is reasonably priced for what you get my wife is taiwanese and is quite happy with the quality of the foodthe hot pot is above table (not an inside the table hot pot you get in asia)  really enjoyed the california rolls definitely would recommend this place for anyone looking for hot pot or a cool asian restaurant for date night
1,brings me back memories of boiling point in socal the taste is almost identical the whole time i was eating i was telling my fiance how much i loved it  the service is kind of slow as they are pretty understaffed but the food overshadows that  we got the spicy beef pot seafood pot and kimchi potspicy beef-  pretty spicy for my taste doesn't come with enough beef but fiance loved itseafood pot- was my favorite comes with a lot of clams shrimp crab and some pork kimchi pot- comes with kim chi of course hot dogs (asian hot pot staple weird i know) and pork  i am usually a beef lover but their pork cooks better than their beef does  the takoyaki is not worth ordering now this appetizer is normally crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside  this one was just soft flavors were there but texture fell flat  we will be back every week
1,have found my new favorite lounge here in scottsdaleand i don't have to drive down to old town stone rose is the innovative creation of the gerber group  by infusing scottsdale's nightlife with cutting-edge design signature cocktails and a dash of glamour - all within a unique indooroutdoor settinga large outdoor bar is surrounded by couches and fire pits and beautifully landscaped  the indoor portion of the barlounge has wooden floors and ceilings with black leather couchesmaking for a retro 1950's feelstone rose is absolutely beautiful within the fairmont princess grounds  with another nyc lounge opening here in scottsdale i am beginning to feel more at home here in the desertfor all you folks that live here in north scottsdale we finally have a poshlaid back lounge
1,patio awesome drinks inside the fairmont princess hotel i came here after dining at the bourbon dealand it was refreshing they have some amazing mixed drinks on the menu and a fun environment good place to mingle and meet people
1,been to this place probably 30 times and it never ceases to have the tastiest drinks and friendliest bartenders in all of scottsdale meredith steven fernando and mike will make you a consistently delicious drink each and every time no matter what your taste buds crave they're also hilarious and will have you smiling through each tasty libation be sure to check out the black raspberry martini and ask for the limelight feeling hungry the chicken lettuce wraps are amazing you won't be disappointed
1,night out in edinburgh and from a guide book we had the dome was listed as a place for the deserving diners who wanted luxury the building itself on the outside is nice not impressive but once you get into the place and past the hall your eyes just feast on the opulence of the restored interior of the victorian former bank and the well designed bar area they certainly added to the interior when the bar and restaurant was designed someone really knew how to make the most out of this victorian interior we ordered our tom collins (perfect great start when they get your cocktails right) and asked to see someone about possible seating in the dinning area as the place looked busy we thought we would have to wait a while but this was taken care off very swiftly by the restaurant manager 'alan' and shown to our table by a very helpful waitress who applied the same high standard of service all night long and we were in no rush the food is as you would expect for a fine establishment first class also the service by the various staff was again first class anyone going to edinburgh for work or play treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience and go to the dome it's a must
1,rate the food because i didn't have any but what an amazing bar the christmas decorations are breathtaking the staff is very friendly and for being as beautiful and centrally located as it is alcohol prices were very reasonable especially if you are travelingpassing through take an hour or so to stop by this bar you won't regret it
1,the dome is marvelous and situated in a beautiful building but i must point you in direction of the garden cafe which is the outside cafe area located at the back of the dome the same fantastic food but outside in the sun entrance is via rose street so don't wander inside the dome and get lost like we didmy gran and i sat outside here one day and enjoyed a fabulous lunch we both had caesar salad which was delicious as well as sharing a plate of chips my granny just loves chips so its great to get my carb fix for dessert i had sticky toffee pudding which came with the most refreshing coconut ice cream it had homemade shortbread too it really was to die for and the highlight of the meal while we were eating it started to rain and all the waiters hurried around us erecting these huge umbrellas it was fun to watch and it felt like we were in a tent once they had finished the garden cafe is only open in the summer months though so it is great for that time of year otherwise i go back inside to the dome which never fails to impress with the amazing surroundings and wonderful service
1,christmas my mum and i get butterflies about going to the dome if you've seen the christmas wreaths wrapped around the pillars you'll begin to see why and if you go inside you will understand completely it's like they have a room spray of all the christmas smells and keep it constantly puffing out in plooms of fairy dust and laughter every year i have to catch my breath when i go into the dome because it is quite simply breathtaking the decoration is beautiful and the whole atmosphere is electriceven when it's not christmas the dome just has a magical feeling about it it's like a fairytale yeah it's a bit pricey but worth every penny you can't go to somewhere like the dome and not expect to pay for it it's also a hot-spot for celeb-spotting (although the amount of celebrities in edinburgh is extremely limited)
1,interior "dome" is magical  i thought maybe it had once been a church but it has been converted from a bank  we just had drinks so i cannot comment on the food  their christmas decorations were breathtaking
1,at this fabulous restaurant last night with clients thursday night in edinburgh and at 8pm it was packed when we finally pushed back from the table at 1115 it was still packed in portland on a thursday night at 1115 just about everything is closed the room itself is fantastic converted from an old bank it is incredibly ornate with a huge stained glass dome hanging over the room yes i did have the haggis wrapped in phyllo as an appetizer and it was amazing the rest of the meal was of equal quality and the service was impeccable if you find yourself in the scottish capital make your way to the dome
1,the place to take your friends from abroad to show off some granduer of edinburgh i like the time around christmas when they go all out and install the theme to the max decorated pillars outsite check massive tree in the main bar  restaurant check good atmosphere friendly waiting staff and free nuts or haggisballs check check and check it is a good place to start of your evening on george street (if a little expensive) you will be well impressed
1,time in the dome and will be paying another visit soon cannot rate highly enough such an amazing place at xmas decorations are superb they have spent a lot of time and effort to get it looking this good it even smells like xmas due the amount of cinnamon sticks intertwined within the decorations never had time to dine but sampled a few cocktails and they were top notch bit pricey but worth every penny for the atmosphere alone
1,restaurant and very good quality food - possibly the best we had there while on a recent trip the server did not have a good command of english which doesn't bother me from an ethnic standpoint but makes it difficult to communicate in fact edinburgh seems to be populated by foreign guest workers and oddly they are almost all in service positions must be plenty of jobs there and i'm guessing low unemployment rate anyway i digress and again want to state how opulent this place is and the food presentation matches the surroundings
1,hoo   just heard the dome is putting up its xmas decs next weekend must be the best place in town for a xmas night out always make a point of popping in to see it
1,be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place tucked down a flight of steps just off george street but in my opinion that's half of it's charm it's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality not because it's in your faceit's easy to see why when you step inside it's like being on some sort of japanese garden terrace with the green leafy plants and water feature rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it next to the fresh flowers and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusivealthough it's never going to make the top 10 list of cheapest places in edinburgh you do get what you pay for that said at the moment all of the montpeliers venues have their "better by half" promos on: glasses of house wine selected cocktails selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment i've been making the most of these offers every time i'm out for fear that they might finish soon but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet happy daysi've only ever drunk here but one of these days i will be going for food the plates i've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous there are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof
1,the last 6 months ricks has definitely had a good shake up and after my fantastic experience last week i think things can only get better the bar team are innovative and original and during a busy friday night shift never failed to impress me as i worked my way through the new cocktail list and the bar snacks were unique and delicious the dj provides a funky relaxed atmosphere and gradually builds up the beats to get you in that weekend mood i will be back again and again and will be taking all my friends too i recommend a passionfruit frozen margarita or 'busy with the fizzy' strawberry soda stream cocktail just fab
1,bar is a life saver after all day of walking at the sands convention center this is a nice place to sit and enjoy a cigar have few drinks drinks are moderately priced service is excellent if any downside i can think of that will be to find a seat right after the closing of a convention when you can get run over by stampede of tired and thirty convention attendees i love this bar and of course will visit again
1,new restaurant in the scottsdale quarter  this place has it all great food great ambiance great selection of champagnes and wines i went there new years eve on their second night open and had a fantastic night  the room was breathtaking and the people there were great not to mention the service was right on  haven't been to any other club in town that has the feeling narcisse has  do not miss out
1,is a beautiful place i've been waiting so long for a champange bar in the valley i consider myself a champagne connoisseur so i had to go try it out i was there on opening night as well as there new lady's night on thursdays i'm very impressed with the staff and service as well as the by the glass list i will definitly be back and will be bringing more friends i highly recommend it
1,narcisse managementeverything is delicious and amazing however you have a misspelling displayed prominently i will tell you where when you treat me and select friends to a bottle of champagne warmly and amusedly dally gold
1,was here last night with a group of about 150 people for a scottsdale league for the arts event  everything was great and this place was rockinggreat drinks and selection of bubbly  cool decor good music pretty people and friendly service
1,the joys of scottsdale; see a great movie in an awesome theater - then stop next door for glass of champagne and fresh strawberries and chocolates on a lovely outdoor balcony  we ordered glass of the champagne that james bond always ordered in bond movies - what a treat
1,opened in the chic and trendy scottsdale quarter narcisse is an opulent champagne lounge that feels like it's straight out of vegas so much so that they've got velvet ropes at the entrance fortunately the doormen waved us right through so we didn't have to endure a waitonce inside we found ourselves in a gorgeous space filled with gorgeous people everyone was dressed to the nines and the crowd was mostly in their late 20's to late 30's with a dash of cougars and manthers the dj on saturday night was spinning fun hip hop and dance beats but my girl friend and i seemed to be the only ones who let loose on the dance floor sure sipping champagne is sophisticated but stop being so stiff peopledefinitely a chic spot to lounge with friends mingle with strangers and dance the night away there's a great outdoor seating area as well with lots of heat lamps set up so we also enjoyed hanging out there and meeting some really friendly locals they serve up a huge selection of champagne as well as beer and spirits but you really can't come here without popping a bottle veuve
1,of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls   1 i am a huge champagne fan 2 you can smoke on the patio 3 the drinks are great and 4 i loved the decor and atmosphere  my friend and i were at salt next door for a friends birthday party on a friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out  the staff as a whole were awesome everyone was very polite and sweet  it has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses  the dj was great as well fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service yay
1,is my new favorite place in scottsdale  first of all i love champagne so any bar that is a champagne lounge gets my vote  the service was good the champagne selection was vast and the atmosphere was totally amazing - the decor was eclectic and so unique
1,love love champagne brunch at narcissethe decor service and food is phenomenal and a few glasses of bubbles can never hurt a sunday morning i've enjoyed the pancakes scones eggs benedict and my favorite breakfast sammy - the dom everything is elegantly plated and tastes really freshthe nightlife is upscale but a little scottsdale-homogenous - everyone seems to look the same if that's the scene you crave then narcisse is the place to behm  now i want breakfast food and champagne
1,made it to narcisse on friday night and found the place quite fabulous with it's glam decor comfy seating and pretty views i was a happy camper i got served my drinks very fast each time i ordered  the music was pretty loud but still enjoyable and the crown was attractive friendly in the late-20's to early 40's age range which is just right for me  it's nice enough to wear heels and a little dress or even jeans and a cute sweater it was not overly crowded nor did we have to wait in line to enter so nice job narcisse i shall be back for sunday brunch to take advantage of your $1000 endless bubbly's
1,was the grand opening andthey nailed it  service: a+ decore: a+drink strength : a+time to get in: c (with being on the list w a table) but with all the other a'sit was worth itthey have a girlsguys bathroom with a bar in it that is one of the coolest things i have ever seen and music that is "bumpin"  we even ordered some food to munch on and it was delicious we got the tuna tartar a chicken salad and some pork stick things that were great portions and very tasty  plus the service never faltered and was super impassive for being packed and opening nightall in alli was impressed and for sure going back
1,really wish we hadn't left the mint last night  the only thing i did not love was the mint we dropped on drinks but hey its scottsdale oh and the boobs in my faceour bartender aj  took great care in muddling my jefferson (5 stars) and sharman's mint (how can you go wrong with a drink named after the establishment) while entertaining us with an infused vodka taste test my new favorite drink was discovered last night--ginger vodka press: run do not walk to your nearest liquor dealerthe tapas were ultra cheap and tasty we took down the tuna tartare and  fried wontons and there are several others i would go back for  these two items were the perfect base for our evening ahead  i want to return for the bubbles- the gold digger eye candy of all ages dress to the nines for this joint
1,a nice upscale establishment with a vegas feel in scottsdale great decor professional and attractive staff all around a great environment i am surprised at some of the comments on here that are negative clearly those people have never been to many clubsbars the door hosts are some of the best in the state anyone that has ever been to a hot night club knows if it is busy and you want to get in quick be extra nice to the door staff not act like a moron with an attitude if you don't want to wait in line get there early it's also nice to see a place with a dress code so that guys actually have to look some what respectable an not like a bum wearing shorts an flip flops use your head fellas your going out on the town not to a pool party have some pride in the way you look the mint is top notch thank you for a great time every time i am a fan for sure
1,group has enjoyed being a little spoiled at this venue the staff is always willing to accommodate our large group (of possibly louder than normal queens i mean temperamental wait i mean well-mannered gentlemen)our bartenders have taken care of the random requests we somehow always seem to come up with after a few drinks and the taller gentleman with the buzz cut and amazing arms can take my money any day he is hotif it is a late night drop in just before we call it a night on a saturday of thursday the back rooms are a blast to shoot the sht in or an early visit to start off the sunday funday up in front in one or two of the booths they have available the mint will offer a fun experience and i recommend making time to visit the powder room
1,spend a few nights a week in old town and will always end up at the mint  their door staff bouncers and vip hosthostess are all very nice and have spoiled me to no end lol  i like the more upscale vibe here and was reminded of how well this club sets itself apart from others when i visited another venue just around the corner a week ago  the d-bag factor was high at the other club not so much here  it seems they actually pay attention to who they are letting through the doors at the mint which is a welcome reprieve from a lot of clubs in old town  i saw one reviewer's posting about all the seriousness of the mint's clienteleand while i've witnessed this a couple of times before i attribute it to what i've experienced in other clubs:  i just get worn down some nights by all the 20-somethings getting flat wasted making a scene or hitting on me (i'm 42) and after a solid evening of that i just might be a tad antisocial myself lol  but you generally don't find that at the mint  it's a safe place to hear great beats hang out with good friends and make a few new friends as wellthey have a very good menu too and i suggest going before club hours to sample it (although their kitchen is open during club hours as well)  the mint will always be my go-to spot and i always suggest it to visitors
1,for dinner before the music starts
1,cool place
1,love this place its a very classy place to hang out and lounge during the day time and when you wanna dress up to the 9s its a fun night club at night i really enjoy the management and find the staff to be very helpful and friendly
1,love this bar super upscale and great service when you get table service  we felt like kings and the place got packed pretty late  it wasn't busy early but there are so many bars in the area to start at but i highly recommend ending up here  isaac took great care of us and went out of his way to make us feel like vip  the place is pretty large and has a great outdoor patio as well  you definitely feel classy when you are in this place
1,i came on a saturday night and this place was - amazing i have been to almost all of the clubs in old town and i have to say this is by far one of the besti always go mainly to dance and this place was packed and everyone who was on the dance floor danced sometimes people are mingling on the dance floor talking or only slightly putting effort (in other words taking up prime space) but people here actually danced it seems silly but this is amazing it encourages other people to do the same and gives a highly energetic vibe to this place very attractive like people just don't give a f*** and want to have a good time that's exactly how i like itthe atmosphere was not only created by the enthusiastic crowd but the incredible lighting as well ethereal is the best word for it - not too dark not too bright for the dance floor and then outside of the dance floor just bright enough and yet still somehow maintained very low-lighting i'm not sure how they achieve this balance but i'm pretty sure it's magic the decor appearance and condition of this place is absolutely gorgeous the way it was designed is stunning like a victoria secret's model - glamorous sexy laced with elegance and bejeweled with luxury i also love the layout of this place once you enter you hit the dance floor which is circular like maya's those are the best (between the people and setting it was the most comfortable dance floor i have ever danced on - people who just wanted to have fun danced were very attractive and chill) you can then go around the dance floor to the bars to get a drink or continue all the way to the back to get a break from dancing back there is an extremely nice lounge area where you can lay back relax and have a drink and chat i can't express how much i love this large lounge area in the back i adore it i adore it i adore it it has so much space room and (comfortable) seating with intimate couches and spinning chairs and it's like a glamorous long break room or like another club all together yes i love dancing but hell i need a break for water and a chat too the bathrooms are back there as well for those that need it there's also a long and large outdoor patio with seatingby the dance floors there are actually platforms which you can stand on and dance on sometimes my friends and i dance on them they're really convenient when the actual dance floor gets too crowded and you can just hop on one of those but i do believe they're actually for the go-go dancers that come on wednesday night oops owell haha alright so i actually did not order a drink here or use the bathroom which are kind of my requirements for giving an honest to goodness complete review so i'll be back to update on drink prices and quality and whatnot honestly i just danced the night away this visit and loved every second of it will be back love you mint oh yeah and the cover charge for men is $10 while women pay nada woo love it the lines were rather short i think i waited 10 minutes tops and the people at the front were very friendly and nice no attitude whatsoeverpossibly because of the cover charge there were more women than men - whoa rare i know and there was a variety of ethnicities so all in all great mix in addition to that it was the first time where i had seen more than 3 attractive guys at a club haha lots of attractive people here men and women i don't know what it is but i guess a good looking and feeling club attracts good looking and feeling people how else could you explain it first and only club i've seen so many good looking peoplei'm coming back here asap next weekend doing this every weekend if possible sorry maya smashboxx and intl but i found a better lover we can keep it an open relationship if you'd like i don't mind
1,cool almost as good as atl clubs
1,to 2 strip clubs last night the 1st was across the street from arizona mills it was garbage women were tweekers music was old as hell felt like i was tony montana the 80s 2nd club  was this place and they didn't not disappoint women were all shades and shapes from thick and slim and a variety of bad chicks i'm big on music and dj was on fire all the latest music mostly hip hop which i love cause let face it who wants to watch strippers dance to taylor swift or sum bs drinks where kinda pricey i would def pregame b4 going but tha girls where on point shoutout to blue she had me on cock diesel all night will definitely be back when the homies wanna step out again comparable to starz (la) kod(mia) onyx (atl) dg's(d town) da rhino is where its at
1,is my drink of choice morning noon and night having perle so close to my job could present a real problem for me  with cocktails running around $800  and with the staff being so damn charming  i could easily see myself there at least 3 nights a week *cha-ching downtown champagne is hard to come by i can count on one hand the number of bars downtown that even serve it  perle is for sure a dream come true for some one like myself the service here was top notch the waiter dj and chef both chatted me up and the bar tender even offered me suggestions on things i might enjoy i like the lay out of the lounge and i think that a lot of thought want into planning the interior design  the marble bar also really appeals to me i have never seen anything like it before the dj leah upon noticing that i was using my e-cig at the bar came down and was very sweet to chat with me and was encouraging since i have been trying to quit smokingi had the mango ceviche that was so good i had to order another tapas so i had the california too the mango ceviche was shrimp and salmon with mango and red onions and cilantro and served with lime wedges the baby face chef was a little chubster and super sweet to come and inquiry about the dish all and all i had two tapas and three cocktails a cham cham a mimosa and a red rose bud  my favorite was the cham cham i will certainly be back to get down with the get down and get my champagne on
1,i walk in the door perle' has my bellini  ready all the bartenders go out of their way to chat ya up and educate you about the various menu offerings i have never met a more caring bar staff  bonus perle's happy hours is from 5:00-8:00 pm 2 dollars off champagne cocktails and $1 tapaseven if the last time you had champagne was at your brother's wedding or new years eve go in and try a champagne cocktail  you might find out your really do like it
1,i went here for a co workers birthday party a few nights ago i must say it's a very nice place they have leather chairs and sofas all over the place the lighting is very appropriate for what vibe they are trying to give off here drinks are a little expensive but almost every person including myself was dressed up woman had dresses on and man wore suit jackets or dress shirts with ties the door man wears a tux the deserts are amazing that's all we had on there menu so i can't tell you much about there other food the service was fantastic we had our own waiter who only was serving the birthday party if you want to celebrate a promotion that you got from work or are going out on a date with someone you've been with for awhile i would definitely recommend this place a lot of couples go here from what i saw so maybe not for someone who is single and i went on a saturday but the place does get packed so you'll have fun regardless of who your with they have a jacket check which is nice overall i will be going back o this place 5 stars in my book
1,have been to perle a few time and this is exactly what pittsburgh had been missing it's beautiful inside the drinks are great and there is a good crowd i like the fact that they enforce a dress code and keep the place upscale they have a big variety of champagne to keep the ladies happy i can't  wait to go back
1,place is great i got screwed over on amazon for a wii and called around to local pawn shops to see what they had most shops were selling wiis for $50+ but here kat gave me a great deal on a bundle and i got two games for under $10 they were kind courteous and even hooked the system up for me in store so i could ensure that it works their electronics come with a 30 day warranty so if there are any problems you can take it backi plan to go back and scope out their laptops when mine finally takes a dirt nap (which isn't far off)go see kat and the team at super pawn on central
1,place to buy guitars and pedals great workers there  super mega awesome customer service  i wouldn't get my instruments from anyone else
1,best pawn shop in las vegas
1,pawn is a very trustworthy establishment  i found a piece of art for sale on-line and ez pawn staff assisted me through the entire process  their staff returned my calls and emails on-time completed the transaction on the phone and assisted me getting the art piece delivered safely to my home in california  i am a very happy customer and i look forward to working with ez pawn again
1,a huge selection but they have some really tremendous vintage pieces i got my 1956 rosewood and black leather herman miller eames lounge & ottoman in very good condition here--for $4k  that is remarkable
1,traded in a set of drums here and was able to get a great deal on a guitar the employee who helped me was very knowledgeable and honest  he genuinely cared for the purchase i wanted to make  he gave me a great deal and showed me keys components in the item i bought i would highly recommend doing business with this company it's a small looking place on the outside but  when you get inside they have a good selection or multiple things very honest business
1,stopped here thinking it was mo money pawn (which i was not impressed with once i found) really nice collection of things musical instruments tools guns they had these two crazy looking knives from brazil with intricate claywork and real monkey skulls on the hilt the guy at the counter was very friendly and seemed genuine the place had a nice vibe we were looking for ammo but like every other store in the city right now they were out i will definitely be back
1,place is great got rid of some jewelry i never wear and they got me the beat price for it plus they had a variety of items for sale the staff was friendly and you can tell that the manager johnny definitely takes pride in his staff and store wonderful experience
1,was my very first time pawning anything in my entire life i entered ez pawn and was helped by a team of very nice gentlemen my item was appraised and i was given a good amount my transaction was completed quickly and easily everyone at ez pawn was extremely helpful and provided me with superior customer service i would recommend ez pawn to anyone even those who are first timers like myself five stars who knew pawn shops were so nice :)
1,have been here a few times liberty is awesome they always treat you very kindly and do all they can to help people i won't go anywhere else liberty thanks for being there
1,you liberty pawn i was recently in a bind and needed some cash the only thing i had of value was an apple product - and i needed back the following week i tried 2 places before finding liberty i went to a small private shop that held you to the 3 month term not letting you pay in full early forget that then there is the famous super pawni hate them not only are they the most awkward people ever they do not give you fair value for your item thankfully i found liberty the staff was genuine super friendly and honest they take pride in their business and are very fair with their lending practices if i'm ever in a bind again i will definitely come back
1,of two places to check out whenever i'm in pittsburgh for such a small space paul's is incredibly dense they have this unique carding procedure where they keep all the new cds behind the counter and you bring the card up to the counter to get it they usually have an amazing used cd selection as well plus they have mojo and uncut magzines flown in from the uk and you can usually get them about a month before borders does on most days paul himself will be there they are also very plugged into the local scene as far as what they carry i rarely leave here without a few amazing finds
1,of the first things i did when i had a little free time after moving to pittsburgh was to locate a good cd store  paul's definitely fits the bill  a small but extremely orderly (re: alphabetized) shop  i knew what i was looking for otherwise i could have spent an hour browsing  genre sections are clearly labeled and easy to find  right when you walk in you'll find a rack of the newest releases on your right hand side  after i had acquired my bounty of wolf parade and stephen malkmus discs it was time for the final test having a chat with the staff  the experience was good - they are friendly and very knowledgeable and i can look forward to asking them for recommendations
1,so small so compact and full of everything you could desire really  great selection  knowledgable staff  it's truly one of the best things bloomfield and pittsburgh has to offer
1,is my favorite record shop in town as others have noted--it's not a big place but it is chock full of (well-organized) stuff they have a wide variety of music and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly  they know about *music* not just one variety and they've never been condescending or rude if they don't have something you're looking for in stock they'll gladly order it for you and they were very helpful when i was trying to find out whether an old jazz record had been reissued on cd if i can't buy my cds straight from the band paul's is where i go
1,paul's is turning into sound catwhile i've only been here a couple of years i find that paul's consistently has the best selection of new cds if you have vaguely discriminating music tastes (non-mainstream)  very wide array of indie music  not just your standard indie poprock but also avant-garde ambient etc  my purchases are ~70% planned plus a bunch that i spotted while browsing  sometimes i'll even see an album here that i wasn't previously aware of and check it out online then go back and buy it  every time i've been here my reaction is "ooooh i can't believe they actually have this" at 10+ albums; then i have to consider my budget and only buy 2 or 3 at a timewill definitely continue to go when it's sound cat records  strongly recommend
1,of the great independent record stores karl hendricks runs his business just like he plays: with passion and creativity
1,records is a great shop with a well curated new lp section the prices are spot on as well what i love about this store is learning something new everytime in enter it the owner and employees provide a wealth of knowledge and suggest great music
1,best selection of new lps at a great price the used selection is curated well and very affordable i love the vibe and i am so happy to have this store in my neighborhood
1,have been buying records from this building for the last 20 years  i was so happy when i heard that karl hendricks was taking over the space  i feel like the selection has gotten even more fine tuned  they have a wonderful selection of obscure vinyl  and every one in the store is always so helpful  every time i go there i see one of my friends  i love this place
1,found tons of great vinyl records here excellent prices the dollar bins held all of the treasures
1,we love this place the staff is so pleasant vinyl selection is the best this is always a true treasure hunt  my husband and i are all for the privately owned book stores big box stores can't do what these guys can do
1,treasure trove a goldmine frankly the biggest motherload of quality classic vinyl lps i've *ever* seen  imagine 13000+ sqare feet of jazz blues soul funk r'n'b rock folk documentaries comedy instructionals soundtracks etc  
1,
1,can't find that rare bluessouljazz record on ebay or anywhere else jerry prolly has it  and the kicker is that the average price for records here is $3-$4  yep you heard right  
1,
1,if you're a vinyl junkie don't go here unless you have all day to browse and listen  i allocated 2 hours and it felt like 15 minutes  i know folks who make special "record buying" trips to 'da 'burgh from canada just to go to jerry's  yes its that good
1,have been to jerry's about 4 times since moving to squirrel hill  on my first visit i came looking for cd's and left with 5 lp's and a turntable  there is something for everyone here and lots of hidden treasures  a truly localuniqueincredible record shopping experience don't miss it
1,of the premier record stores in the entire country totally amazing not overpriced has a friendly staff who are there because they're into music jerry himself is still there most of the time even though i heard he was trying to retire stores like this are the heart and soul of a city's music scene and i think that pittsburgh never died as a record town partly because of this very place any visit to pittsburgh requires a visit to jerry's and then to paul's cds
1,this is almost overwhelming  i have never experienced an lp store like this one as others have said it is an unimaginable amount of recordsmy one critique of others reviews is that: no he does not have everything  these are all used or at least collectible unsealed lps and you will not find anything current here  no matter there are troves of other interesting things and you can get 5 of them for what you would normally pay for new vinyl
1,for everyone if your into vinyl that is (don't get kinky i am talking records) you can spend hours in this place digging up hidden treasures i am finding records of bands from the 70's and 80's like zebra and twisted sister who i would see back on li at the clubs as a teenager (back in the day) when you would get pulled over for drinking and driving and the police would just say walk home and leave your car instead of throwing you in the slammer and then you would pretend to walk home but when the police left you would double back and get in your car again with all your friends and party some more (ahhh memories)  huuhhh huum oh yeah jerry's is rockin for records
1,too bad i don't have a turntable 'cos this place specializes in vinyl they have records records and more records  me i have a huge cd collection  i don't believe in mp3 players (because if you only have songs downloaded you don't really have a music collectiom do you)  there are some purists who believe that the best sound is on vinyl and my father is one of them  to back up a moment my husband rick was out of town for the day on one of his railfan jaunts  so my brother paul and i decided to get together hang out and maybe get a little christmas shopping out of the way  dad likes music as much as we do  he even likes more current bands like arcade fire and snow patrol  we decided that some used lps would make a big splash with the old man  on an earlier family visit i pilfered his record and cd collection while paul created a diversionwe decided upon getting him "damn the torpedos" from tom petty & the heartbreakers and a rare lp by the busboys  man i have got to get me a turntable  this place is awesome and i could spend hours in here  now isn't shopping and browsing at a place like this way more fun than amazon or e-bay
1,sells non-recent music on vinyl either used or collectiblei've known djs from nyc who took bookings to pittsburgh simply for the excuse to go to here  you can spend hours in this storethey have more records than any other record store i've had the luck to see   more of their records are things you'd actually want to buy  their prices are cheap  their staff is friendlyfor what they do i've never seen better
1,nearly impossible to beat the size & selection here no matter what city you're in pretty much any lp here is $3-$4 it's really easy to spend an entire afternoon digging through all the records that jerry's hasif you've never been there- hit up the "newgood stuff" first near the front this is the dumping ground for incoming records most of the good ones get snatched before being filed away  another fun thing to do is think of any single that may have been on the jukebox while you were a kidteen jerry's has it on 45 (the organization back there is amazing)don't forget to bring cash no credit cards
1,isn't much to say that hasn't been said jerry's is where it's at
1,these idiots who gave 1 star rating must be dork hipsters who know nothing about record collecting  i've been a customer at jerry's since he was in oakland  great guy great store  it is one of a kind and known across the world  you could spend a week going through everything
1,than b-side less hip (in a good way) than exclusive madcity is where the serious local music-makers (and -lovers) shop the vinyl selection is amazing and the clerks are smart without being smart-ass what you'll find: midwest artists' releases newused vinyl newused cds magazines rarecollectible stuff and a clerk or two with his finger literally on the pulse of the local rock scene what you won't find: a clerk that will be willing to special order you the latest steven seagal country cd (come on guys i heard it was really good)
1,i can't believe i haven't reviewed madcity yet i've been to most of the music stores in town and they're all pretty good (especially considering that in my neck of the woods now my selection is limited) but i can confidently say that madcity is the best madcity has a very good selection of vinyl albums including 45s (which i almost never see anymore even in specialty music stores) there's also an extremely good collection of 60s cds; most good recordcd shops have plenty of the familiar hit-makers like the beatles the rollings stones the byrds various motown artists etc how many of them carry music by obscure 60s bands such as love or the gurus also their selection of progressive rock (ie yes emerson lake & palmer) is very good as well contemporary stuff is in abundance here as well if  you live in the madison area you absolutely must come here and even if you are just visiting the area you still pretty much need to make a stop here if you are a music enthusiast
1,great independent music store  really good selection (plenty of obscure stuff)  lots of vinyl
1,place has the best selection of music in the downtown radius  scratch that the best selection in madison period  i don't mean the have the most music just the best of the best  and their 50 cent-$1 vinyl selection is pretty fun to browse through  the owner seems like a pretty cool guy as well which is nice because he's honest and not always trying to sell me up on something unlike the creep at strictly discs  they have a convenient drop box for 4 star video too which is handy now that i live on willy st  hey kids stop all the downloading  support your local record shop
1,in madison for a day i needed to find two specific recordsthe association and sniff'n the tears  i went to b-side but they didn't have used vinyl so i checked out madcity as soon as i walked in the door i was greeted with a smile from the guy behind the counter(i soon found out he is the owner)  i was left alone the whole time(which i prefer at record stores)  i was very satisfied with their selection of used vinyl madcity is obviously aware that they are catering toward townies and students so they keep their prices appropriate while i didn't find the two records i was looking for i did walk away with three gemspurple rain by prince for $3simon and garfunkels greatest hits for $3kick by inxs for $2this is a sweet store with a sweet owner  no pretention no games just the way i like it  i even joined the madcity facebook pageand i don't even live in madison
1,checked out most record stores and this one is at the top of my list i hate feeling pressured and judged when i shop for music and i've never felt that way here like i do by the pretentious owner at strictly discs the owner of madcity is pretty chill and friendly so i never feel intimidated the selection of vinyl is pretty spectacular too and at great prices my favorite thing is their marketing (videos and such)it's so cheesy and fun that i can tell what kind of environment they create for their customers and it's very inviting
1,been a customer of this store for years  the best thing i love about this store is you can listen to the used cd's and lp's  i've found things i would never have bought but after listening to samples of the cd or lp picked it up  it also has worked in reverse where i've listened to a cd or lp and decided not to buy it  they also buy used cd's and lp's
1,was able to find some old good music in their $1 (50 cents if you buy ten+) sale section they had the elusive tribe called quest vinyls so i had to pick that up i didn't know what to expect as i walked in but the guy behind the counter left us alone to browse he was playing 50's rock and roll which annoys no one i even found a vinyl of juan gabriel maybe the only one in the store but it's mine now i wouldn't hesitate to be back their sale section was filled with so many hidden gems (the mamas and the papas santo and johnny the supremes to name a few)
1,thought this place was the bestuntil i moved to san francisco & visited the jeweled paradise of amoeba records still by suburban standards it rocks zia stores have maybe a quarter of the selection of amoeba (plus twice as much of a country selection)but you only need a few handfuls of quarters for purchases here those low-down dirty desert prices are everyone's style
1,
1,record exchange is an ideal place to locate those hard-to-find cds you have had no luck finding in those other chain stores and don't want to pay way too much for online they feature a prominent selection of indie artists from labels such as subpop and kill rock stars nestled right next to the latest britney christina release you should have no problem finding a few treasures among the aisles and aisles of cds used and new if dvds are your thing they offer a fair selection of the typical hollywood movies if concert and music dvds are more up your alley then this is the place to shop as they have a massive selection of music videos vinyl record versions of albums are also available for you djs out thereit's not called zia record exchange for nothing you can trade in your used cds and dvds when you get tired of them for store credit or for cash unless the discs are in pristine condition though you'll probably be taking them back home with you check out their website if you get a chance you can download a pdf version of the in-store newsletter for your perusal or listen to podcasts featuring music by new and upcoming artists you'll be sure to discover something new or find that elusive album you've been searching high and low for when you visit zia record exchange
1,was soooo happy when zia record exchange moved so close to my home this old granny even got herself a zia's frequent buyer card [which someday i'll actually figure out what i'm accumulating]for those newbies to the valley who don't know what the heck i'm talking about zia's is one of the valley's institutions of new used and just plain weird music movies and games these days i see that they're also offering other cool and zany stuffevery time i go out shopping hubby says "you don't need any more cd's do you" to which i reply "honey i always need new music"the selection is really fabulous the prices are low enough not to bust my budget and the vibe is just -- well how fabulous can the vibe be at 19th ave and indian school yet zia's manages to keep the hip factor aliveand if i ever get tired of my music not that that's ever gonna happen they'll buy it back such a deal
1,been going to this zia for 15 years yes i know it used to be on 7th and indian school  growing up in a lower middle class family mom's suggestion to us if we wanted to get new music was to trade in old and we did i remember doing the math if i traded in 4 cd's i could afford to get 3 used cd's not a bad return since they moved they got to expand a touch they now have a metal section which is brutal no more thumbing through brittney spears or kenny chesney when i'm looking for some heavy shit customer service is always top notch the customer rewards card is cool you accumulate points just for purchasing a nice place to get cd's dvd's and even vhs
1,is pretty much the equivalent of newbury comics the record store i frequented most back home in boston  now that i've moved out here it was nice to find something so similar  re: chris r- true a lot of people are done with cds due to the changes in the music industry over the years  but for a lot of people you can't replace the experience of browsing a huge selection of artists at a place like thisi'll go here and spend an hour or so until i have a stack of like 6 or 7 cds then narrow it down to the best 3 or 4 finds to buy that day  i've gotten a lot of good deals here and always enjoy myself  staff is great
1,fucking love this place its helped me expand my dvd collection tremendously at a cheap price zia is the best place to get the latest art independentforeign and new releases on dvd at a great price even if they are used i have never had a single problem with any of the used dvd's i have purchased there the cd collection is awesome and they usually have hard to find releases that places like best buy and borders dont carry some other reviewer said he can get all these things for the same price on ebay but who wants to wait for their stuff to come in the mail and spend money on shipping and ending up with scratched materialzia is the place to be
1,is a sweet new location they moved from the 19th ave & indian school to camelback the really cool thing is it's right next to the light railthe store is an old cvs store so it's super bright inside with all the cool signs and a massive vinyl section   i dont think ive ever seen a larger vinyl area in a local store (unless you're vinyl only)cool people and super awesome staff highly recommend
1,found good music and good movies for cheap each time i go into this zia  they also have a lot of cool toys  and the staff has always been really friendly to me  thank you zia
1,old yes just a look at my t&a and you'd think i was a young and fresh bunny but sadly the few wrinkles on my face and grey hairs say other wise anyway i remember the first cd i ever bought was sheena easton's first and self titled cd i was so excited that i played that cd over and over i still feel the same way when i purchase a cd more so when i purchase a cd at a record store and at a bargain i love to browse around and listen to the staff's current faves and the recommended new artists at the music listening stations i have a huge shelves and shelves of cds and i still get excited when i add another cd to the collection support indie record storesand old people like myself that prefer old fashion record stores cheers***
1,place is just fun you walk around the large former pharmacy and there's display signs featuring dave chappelle as rick james and a floor-hamburger eating david hasselhoff really solid selection of vinyl records genres include rock (biggest) r&b hip-hop and electronic there's a retro video games section where you can reminisce about your favorite nes cartridge the dvd selection is ridiculously deep especially in the tv section lots of cool books gifts and a place where you can make your own t shirt they offer a trade in section where they acquire their treasures behind the trade area there's a wall display with all sorts of star wars toys still in the box the prices were fair go there it's an experience
1,radio advertisement for exile on main compares this place to the store in the movie high fidelity and it's hard not to go along with that except it's so much more than that i don't even know if you can get some of these magazines and dvds at other locations in town the selection is unique and worth looking through if you're interested in independent music films etcoh and you can play donkey kong or joust for free on their vintage arcade machines and they sell candy and do pc repairs and upgrades for less than other places
1,so glad we still have a record store in champaign great helpful staff if what you're looking for is not in stock they will order it orders are usually in within the week by my experience they offer a really nice record collection and have great deals (sidewalk sales) on used cds can you find cheaper prices online sure but buying here shows support to not only exile but champaign and the downtown area the town is better for having exile herelet's keep it that way
1,is the most ideal local record store i can imagine and we have it right here in champaign a great selection for every kind of person and an owner who should win awardsdaily this is the place
1,locally owned shop for all your audiophile and gaming needs from the past + todaywhenever i need a vinyl that they might not have in stock i make a special order and within days it's at the store waiting for me thank you for keeping my ears happy all these years
1,awesome friendly great selection done  ok yelps admin wouldn't let me end my review with done  was too short so  in a long winded kind of way that i don't really like to review things i really dig what exile does  great events throughout the year in addition to just being a retail spot  get your wax poetics get your game one get some god damn records
1,local business knowledgeable staff great selections and mountains of vintage goodies and you can still order new stuff tooif you cant find what you wanted they will order it for you or if you are a regular keep an eye out for a rare item for ya they also take pre-orders on vinyl and new video games as well and they video games are the exact same price as lamestop anywaythe video game selection is amazing and always changingthey have new and used vintage and modern cds and records for fair pricesthey will also take store credit for cool use stuff so you can trade old records and game for that new game you want if ya got the right stuff at the right timepeople keep saying it's expensive but i disagree i believe the prices are very fair for their quality and the cash goes right back into our local economy i think most people don't understand the cost of local and niche goods i used to work at a record store and shipping vinyl is expensive so if you are used to wal-mart prices then go thereoh thats right wal-mart doesnt carry any good music let alone support local musicians with events and sell their merch gee funny how that worksif you are a treasure hunter i highly recommend this place i have found some real gems simply because i was rooting through a random spot in the store
1,things do still come in small packages  if you find yourself in the elizabeth neighborhood don't neglect to drop in here and check out their selection of new and used cds and dvds or just to browse their selection of music-related books magazines and local news rags  park in the back behind the buildingwhen i walked in it brought back memories of my beloved reckless records in chicago  and i knew i'd found my new sonic home in charlotte  it's flanked by a tattoo studio and a pawn shop and admittedly parking is a bit of a pain  but it's worth the effort (both psychological and automotive) to get a gander at some premium stacks of used music  if there's a more punk rock shop in this town drop me a line god save the queen (city)
1,city needs a good record shop and thank god charlotte's got lunchboxi admit that i download more than i physically buy music these days but with lunchbox so close i've started buying cds and records again  every time i've gone in they've had exactly what i was looking for and the dudes manning the counter are always extremely helpfulthis awesome little independent gem is another reason plaza midwood is my favorite neighborhood in the queen city
1,has a great selection of new and used every time i go i want to spend all the money in the world but sadly i can't lunchbox records is easily charlotte's best record store
1,can't stress enough how important it is to go into lunchbox and browse around especially if you have a hunger (like i do) for hearing the new interesting and eclectic the owner scott has poured his heart and soul into giving music fanatics a place in the charlotte metro where we can go and dick around dig through the stacks and find something new and exciting record stores like this are hard to come by you're lucky if your city has one - i know i've seen many good independent record stores hang on and eventually close due to poor sales or community interest from what i've gathered scott has a strong customer base (myself definitely included) and i hope that lunchbox sticks around for a very long long timebut enough soapboxing about the state of really good record stores you want to know what you're going to find there ok sowhen your eyes adjust to dim but cozy lighting indoors you'll probably have a few adjectives spring to mind:1) small;2) cluttered; and3) vinylok so vinyl's not really an adjective in this context but it's an integral part of what makes lunchbox so great - scott collects a wide range of records in every genre imaginable: rock pop electronic jazz rap soul dubstep idm punk noise classical avant-garde alternative spoken-word metal i don't think i really need to go on if you want it they probably have it if they don't scott will order it the vinyl racks line the walls from front to back and are jam-packed with 12"s 10"s and 7"s there's a crate of box sets in the back there's overstock record store day in the corner there's a section of new arrivals used vinyl halfway down the left wall and there's a decent stock of used records that you can dig through to your heart's content the middle section of the store is cd racks - a strong selection of the afore mentioned genres and a decent selection of used cds as well it's not a huge used section and it's definitely an eclectic mix - if you're in for a really big used music selection you should probably check out manifest - but the stuff i do find there is well worth the timeprices are really quite good for what you get especially on the new music scott's goal is to sell just enough over cost to make it worthwhile there's no crazy $699 best-buy-esque specials on new music but he is able to put some reduced price stuff up from time to time your standard-issue cd is going to cost $10-15 vinyl prices are (as usual) slightly higher than cds but generally range $15-20 for most releaseswhat really clinches the deal for me is scott and his staff - they are great people they know their stuff and scott has never once told me that an album is great just because he wants to sell it scott has led me to some absolutely incredible finds and i trust him completely on knowing something new and interesting for me to check outso please to get back up on the box please visit lunchbox whenever you want to hear something new buy it don't download it support your local record store and don't be afraid to hear something new lunchbox is another absolutely integral piece of the plaza-midwood neighborhood and i'll be distraught if it ever goes away
1,people will tell you that vinyl gives a much warmer sound than anything digital - be it cds or downloaded music  that may or may not be true  there are however problems with vinylthe first is that vinyl is a royal pain to keep clean  remove an lp from its sleeve whether it is one you have only just opened or one that you have carefully cared for all of these years and the chances that it will play all the way through without a single skip are at best 50-50  often much lessfor most of us regular non-audiophiles the sound is probably not worth the hassle of dealing with the headaches involved in getting the thing to play: cleaning each and every side of every lp each time you want to play it just to have a chance of hearing the whole record  setting (and resetting) the stylus  removing the record sleeve then the record  reversing the process  cds are so much easier to say nothing of digitized musicis it better  very likely  but is it worth it  that is up to you to decideonce you have decided that you need some vinyl there are only so many options left  in charlotte lunchbox is a great place to go to pick up some old records on the cheap  i mean really cheap  in many cases just a dollar or two for the bargain bin  maybe five bucks for something better  of course this is for old releases  newer stuff will set you back a bit more (and yes new content is coming out on vinyl)you can even pick up turntables both new and used at lunchbox both the traditional kind and the usb sort in case you want to transfer your existing lp collection onto your computer so you never have to deal with those records again  note that this process is not simple but it can be donenaturally the problems with vinyl cannot be attributed to lunchbox - that is inherent in the media  but if you have decided to make the jump this is the place to go if you need help or just want to explore and see if it is for you  definitely a resource to have on your list
1,have found some of my most prized vinyl at lunchbox they don't carry crap it seems like a rule everything on the display is good and on my wish list they know their demographic the staff still can seem a bit judge-y i have been self conscious about my picks before even though i thought they were awesome but if you are lucky enough to get the nod of approval or even a "great album" you will feel like you could be head music editor of rolling stone your self worth shoots through the roof so maybe it is good that they don't hand those head-nods out like candy (i got the head nod with morrisey's "viva hate" and bob dylan's "the free wheelin' bob dylan"make note)
1,live in charlotte now and i frequent lunchbox my bank account my not enjoy it as much as i dobut i freaking love this place best record store in town
1,beats quantity  this store has the highest quality record collection i have seen  they keep shoppers updated on their newly received new and used records via twitter and facebook status which helps to know what is in stock  this alone keeps them at a higher rating than other record stores in clt
1,discovering lunchbox by my work i have become a weekly visitor it seems i haven't been into vinyl long but this is the best shop in charlotte mainly because of the awesome new selection sure manifest has a massive used section which is great but their new stuff is nothing compared to tiny lunchbox also a great place to learn about new music too
1,people were in front of us (yes i count sometimes) waiting for the doors to open at 1:00pm on a weekday and there is not even a concert no "new release" party  this is a popular placethis is my new favorite place to shop for musicdvds and look which means i'm more than a fan of the patrons here  in a popular shop this size it is easy to be inspired in very appropriate ways  if you like what is in here there is a good chance you could meet someone who has similar taste enough about datingthey still have bands doing shows here too  small live music venue very cool   for the size of the store they have a gigantic punk section and even for a store much larger they have a huge punk section  after being here a little while it was easy to understand they only sell the cool movies and music  i found more that i liked here than in several stores combined  this time i found two dvds that i thought i may not be able to find so easily and for only $400 each one french and one thai  i felt more than lucky more like fortunate
1,wax is the place to go for buying metal in madison  they have a huge selection that spans all sub-genres definitely with an emphasis on the more extreme sub-genres  they also have quite a bit of punk psychobilly and ambient although the focus is really on metal  they also have a good selection of merch (shirts patches etc) although i found the t-shirt selection to be a little skimpy as a person who prefers plain logo t's as opposed to shirts with tons of art on them  also most of the shirts are xlear wax also has a decent selection of vinyl dvd's and 'zines although i've never really checked them out  the focus is really on cd'sif you are a "casual" metal fan who thinks that slipknot and trivium are the best the genre has to offer you will be overwhelmed (and possibly intimidated) upon walking in  if you aren't a metal fan at all you won't find anything of interest unless you want a cannibal corpse t-shirt for irony purposes  if you're a die-hard metal fanatic however this store is right up your alley  every time i go in there i have a hard time limiting myself to only a few purchases because there is so much that catches my eye  just about every big metal band is represented along with a whole bunch that i've never heard ofthe price is right (usually around $12 for a cd $7 used) and the selection is unbeatable  if you love extreme music you can't pass up the chance to visit this awesome store
1,i lived in northern illinois and made occasional day trips to madison ear wax is a store that i always made time to stop in  not only do they have a great selection of music but the store owner is knowledgeable and friendly  he's the kind of guy who deserves your business  also they have a great sticker selection  what punk rocker doesn't like to put a few on his or her car
1,love ear wax great selection new and oldgreat customer service as well rob is the name of the guy i always see behind the counter when asked questions about a record or band he doesn't answer in a condescending "i'm more punkmetal than you' manner i've asked for his opinions on bandsrecords old and new and he always answers with a knowledgeable and genuine responsethis shop is a fucking gem of madison \m
1,sure do make the most of a small storeer basement they owner gave me some freebies and was very helpful the bi-lingual staff was out smoking and we were left alone digging for some johnny cash but we compared record stores and curtis mayfield and in general it was very pleasant the best place to find french and 1960s vinyl i can see myself spending long hot summer afternoons here
1,a cool dude and knows his music he's also an avid concert goer and music hound if he can't find it no one can
1,hidden gem located near noda stop in and see karisa owner of nectar florist the history of the garden is amazing it feels like you have stepped out of charlotte and into a fairytale i had my wedding there and i highly recommend it to everyone else too open minded to everyone and all ages if you are from out of town go here take a camera art flowers train car its gorgeous their events are so much fun too mothers day always has something sweet going ongo see this special place
1,place is simply amazing  if you are ever in the area and looking to just past the time you have to pop in here  it is actually a park for the city and there is a lot of history behind the actual site itselfthe flowers are very nice and they have roses obviously but also lots of other flowers and trees as well  the center of the yard has an old coal car from when the railroad used to be in serviceparking is easy with a gravel lot right out front  they also have a few places to rest your feet with bistro tables and benches around
1,for your mind to be blown this is one of charlotte's best secretsit is on n davidson in an industrialsketch area you walk into this stunning garden with plenty of art it is a delight you feel like you are transformed into a new place i cannot recommend this place enough it feels magical there are little paths that you can walk to with privacy there is a large area to be in with a big group we went for a rehearsal dinner and it was breath taking i highly recommend going here
1,of the most wonderful places in the world great to go in the winter to feel some humidity and feel better great for summer to see all the flowers the gift shop is excellent for any (particularly female) gift occasion just a great place to go would be great for a date
1,great place for plant lovers any time of the yearmy wife and i come here every winter (if we can) to attend a conference put on by horticulture magazine(fine gardening)  olbrich does a nice job with preparation including the foodtheir tropical conservatory is a bit on the small side but the building and plants are very well tendedthe various gardens are very well tended  there are 10 or more theme gardens  i love their rose garden:  yes we can grow beautiful roses in wisconsin  in fact some roses have been developed by a hybridizer at olbricholbrich is in a nice area of madison - close to lake monona
1,a great little spot and certainly helps that it's free admission very enjoyable place esp the beautiful rose garden and the thai pavilion reportedly the only one in north america it is quite gleaming
1,to guys everywhere: olbrich is a great place to take a date  you get to walk around in semi-secluded areas and look at beautiful things  it's romantic without even tryingi love seeing how both the outdoor gardens and indoor conservatory flowers change at different times of the year  plus the conservatory is so nice and warm during the winter
1,thoughtfully arranged and free--can't get any better than this favorites: thai pavilion conservatory (smells wonderful) and it being free admission (did i say that already)
1,to my backyard  oh wait i'm hallucinating againbut seriously this place is wonderful  i love going here and i do wish my backyard looked like thisunfortunately for me i brought a minor with me  minor claims to love nature and wants to see it up close and personal but at the same time is deathly afraid of bees and butterflies  most people can understand being fearful of bees and their stings but butterflies  it's the kind of irrational fear i can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallowif you were there today you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction otherwise known as butterflies  i thought i could convince minor to hold my hand and "trust" that i wouldn't let anything bad happen but apparently i'm a lousy saleswoman andor my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent  dangminor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave  a wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing face smashing butterflies of satanbut other than that this is a lovely place when we are not there  thank you and goodnight
1,a great gardenbe sure to see:the thai pavillionthe conservatorythe reflecting pool
1,of the greatest treasures of madison there's no better place to simply relax and enjoy the beauty and variance of nature the only downside: the inevitable disrespectful patrons particularly when it comes to the thai pavilion usually this means people with kids but just as often applies to adults that can't seem to understand the words "please don't touch"
1,gorgeouswe arrived in madison a little late on a thursday afternoon and decided to try to make it to the botanical garden and squeeze a walk in before it closed  we unknowingly got there at the perfect time - 6:30 pm in the summer yielded some beautiful pictures as the sun was a little softer (and not as hot)we strolled around hand in hand on our anniversary vacation - it was romantic quiet and i felt like i was taking deep breaths for the first time in a very long timei cannot recommend this beautiful sanctuary enough
1,is truly a beautiful place and a treasure for madison  please don't ever leave us  be sure to check out the herb garden in the fall  amazing variety of scents  the varieties of  geranium are amazing  lemon chocolate mint vanilla pepper cinnamon turmeric well you get the picture
1,desert botanical gardens are an oasis in the local sea of strip malls and desert  many and varied plant areas including an oasis and desert  summer evening flashlight tours are worth the price of membership
1,place to go when you need to see a cactus or hundreds of them along with a variety of other desert plants i went here with my digital camera and came back with a bunch of photos worth printing the garden is extremely well-kept and is easily accessable admission is cut in half for students so don't forget that id card
1,is the perfect time of year to visit dbgin spring they start their spring jazz in the garden series (every firday night) with food and cash bar beveragesyou can take painting classes just stroll around and now they have this awesome art installation piece made of twigs that you can actually go inside of (completed feb 23)i've been coming here since i was a little 'un and i love coming back especially if you're a native you'll love the "desert rain"  machine it's basically a strainer with creosote and other desert plant leaves inside and you turn on the shower fountain head and get an instant whiff of true monsoon season desert rain smellit's amazing
1,course there is cactus but there is so much more to the desert botanical garden than organ pipe and saguarothe gardens are well thought out and always well maintained watch for jackrabbits and a wide variety of birds now is the perfect time of year for a visit as there will be wildflowers and cacti in bloom and the weather isn't too hot yet but even in the summer it's a nice city escape just wear a hat & sunscreen and try to go first thing in the morning there are drinking fountains around every turn and plenty of shade try a guided tour if you have the time or are playing host to out-of-town guests the guides are friendly and extremely knowledgeable even if you've lived in az all your life (like me) you are bound to learn something new
1,just got back from an arizona spring training vacation and one of the highlights was definitely the desert botanical gardens  we came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm but decided to give it a shotit was worth it  i was a little disappointed that the butterfly pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm and several walking areas were being used for weddingsreceptions (who could blame these people) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife  we managed to get in for free not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though which totally made the park that much more fun  i am not sure i would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if i'd had to pay $5 to get inthe little desert rat-sqirrels and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows  i felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers and have to give this place the ultimate rating   if you're ever in arizona please give this place a try it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see
1,am not usually a fan of botanical gardens they seem too precious too "perfect" to be of much interest and let's face it flowers and plants are beautiful things but when you pay to look at them in neat rows something is lostthat said desert botanical gardens is an exception to this garden cynic many of these cacti look like they are from another planet like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say "wow it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist" they sprawl out on the ground weaving and turning every which way or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground i never knew such bizarre life forms existed or that some cacti look like treesthe gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail lizards or a jackrabbit or two various species of bird can be seen here as well especially at dusk i especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cactithis place never grows old it's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town and because the cacti have been collected from around the world a cool botany lesson for us all here
1,desert botanical gardens in phoenix az is a great way to get a sample of arizona's diverse and spectacular flora  check out the gardens in the spring when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful vibrant colors  this is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs   it's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch  midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats  at the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale  visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time  be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera  don't forget to have fun
1,of a man's garden     when i lived in phoenix (a couple years ago) the papago park desert botanical gardens was one of my favorite places to take out-of-town visiting friends and relatives you tell them "hey let's go to the botanical gardens"  they grumble a little especially the men they of course expect rose gardens tulip beds lavendar and queen anne's lace  wrong  it is a fifty acre garden of beautiful cacti and succulents     beautiful desert plants but no whoosy northern plants needing moisture here these are desert survivors desert rats desert birds desert songs desert lifea man's garden of delights    tough masculine desert plants here but with delicate beautiful flowersgardening help botanical research & education workshops event facilities taste of the desert tours monarch butterfly exhibit garden tours special music art and romantic evening events children's events so much to do & see so little time      even a man will love it herethere is always something going on at the papago park desert botanical gardens  i can't make up my mind whether to go down for the "sahnas brothers spanish guitar" event in february or wait for the "agave on the rocks" in march hmmm     which one which one which one can't do both     check it out  wwwdbgorg  tell me what to do  friends are expecting me      it is cooler in phoenix in february than it is in march     maybe i should let the weather dictateno matter the temperature this is not a place to miss a delight of the possibilities of our world every size shape and kind of cacti & succulent from around the world is here check it outwwwdbgorg
1,love this place  after spending a morning there i was ready to sign up for a yearly membership  who knew there were so many different types of cactus  its really interesting to see them all and learn about their place within the desert ecosystem   you feel as if you are transported to a world many miles away from phoenix (just move the telescope a little if a building gets in your line of sight) and its a perfect place to bring an out of town guest as i am positive they have nothing like it where they are fromthe seasonal butterfly exhibit is fantastic it reminded me of my third grade classroom where we had monarch butterflies just flying around  (my teacher was a little bit of a hippie)  it doesn't have to take up a whole day if you don't want it to and you can explore at your own pace  come spring time i'm sure that the wildflower portion is beautiful  i'm very excited to go back for the las noches de las luminarias
1,one of my favorite places in urban phoenix i am a member and we go often what is there not to like its unique it changes there are events by a bundle even food is semi ok for such place go there no i mean it go stroll through major "roads" venture to some smaller once talk to those nice elderly (for the most part) volunteers who will teach you about surviving on prickly pears or how succulent is different from a cactusdo not liter run around or yell like an idiot please besides that - have fun this place is awesome "i like""very nice"eugene
1,must say this place puts both of the conservatories in chicago as well as the domes in milwaukee to shame   it is old classy large varied and their spring flower show -- we caught the last weekend -- was not only beautiful but original and clever  should be considered one of the highlights of pittsburgh
1,took my mother to phipps during her first visit to pittsburgh earlier this month (april 2007) for the spring flower show  it was a great way to showcase the city and it really impressed her (and me)  the flowers were great and the food in the cafe was fantastic (and very vegetarian friendly)  i've heard their butterfly gardens are great too though they weren't open at the timea must-see
1,was just here for an absolutely stunning chihuly exhibit amazing don't miss it best part of our tripi have high standards too because i'm familiar with longwood gardens near philadelphia looks like the place is a bit lacking in flowering plants if the exhibit wasn't there but still really neat and worth a visit
1,i figured i must have reviewed phipps but i haven'ti'm not a flower guy i mean they're ok and all but i never figured i'd enjoy going to a flower garden but i love phipps everything is really well done and they don't care if you just stroll for a while the butterfly exhibit is really awesome - just go during the day because during the evening they're all sleeping carnegie mellon students get in for free so for four years i had the perfect date spot it's free it's next to campus you seem more sensitive than if you suggested you watch grindhouse
1,pittsburgh gem i recently joined the phipps because i am always impressed with the exhibits and my visit always puts me in a good mood i've been at the phipps in all seasons and attended a couple of the special events (new year's eve and chihuly exhibit) always something interesting to seeno reasonably priced postcards that is a real shame
1,always have great shows plant shows wow - imagine how i'd kick my own ass if i'd heard me say that just 15 years ago - their plant shows are awesome **punch**anyhow they really are i love to photograph the flowering plants and it is a great place to take a client to in order to photograph them at as long as you go when phipps is not too busy or crowded
1,conservatory is another one of the many outstanding cultural amenities in pittsburgh  i wonder if my fellow natives realize the wealth of culture this city hasanyway i took a week's worth of annual leave from work and decided to make the must of our cultural institutions  so i asked my friend marla a stay-at-home mom if she'd like to join me here for a day  marla practically dialed her mother to ask her to babysit even before i was done talking to herone thing i like is that if you only have a little bit of time you can visit the sustainable perennial gardens right around the dome of the phipps  i believe that you can visit this part for free  but the sustainable perennial gardens shows you how you can plant flowers and plants that require little water fertilizer and pesticidesit would be too hard for me to list all of the rooms that phipps has  i guess my favorite is the fern room which has a lot of prehistoric plants and tree ferns many of which have been around since the time of the dinosaurs  i also enjoy the tropical fruit spice room and the tropical forest conservatory  it is in these rooms that we are reminded of one of the reasons that the rainforests are so so important to us  not only is the biodiversity so great but we get so many of our fruits and spices from them  take a moment to deeply inhale this fragrant room  we also get so many medicines from the rainforest and this place has a research lab and a "healer's hut"marla's favorite exhibits are the desert room and the japanese courtyard garden  i can see her point  japanese gardens are intended to be places of tranquility  the phipps also has a huge outdoor garden and i'm glad that we had the nice weather last week  it gave us one last chance to walk through the walkways and the beautiful fountains before they're closed for the winteroh and we saw this guest speaker http:wwwyoutubecomwatchvo7ixe95czoe  i'm just kidding  but seriously the phipps can be a wonderful colorful and relaxing way to spend the day  even if you don't have a "green thumb" you'll find something to like here
1,puts me in the holiday spirit more that a visit to phipps winter flower show i love all the cute "animal" displays and the poinsettias hanging baskets and the xmas trees are beautiful and fragrant i love how they manage to fill the serpentine room with such nice holiday displays my favorite room is always the orchid room there are so many different varieties and i love to be able to see them up close and marvel at their beauty i also love the tropical forest conservatory it's so peaceful and tranquil i love the sunken garden and the victoria room too also the broderie room was also very beautiful in it's holiday decor i can't wait to visit again in the spring
1,wish that every city had a place like this so that in the dead of winter i could trudge through the snowy streets of boston and walk into a beautiful victorian greenhouse if you're visiting pittsburgh phipps should be at the top of your things to see
1,place exudes cheer in an understated wayif you're in pittsburgh for a weekend or longer this should be one of the places to visit  it's rarely crowded it's inexpensive and every room in the building is an awesome collection of plants  flowers cactus palm trees orchids with the seasonal butterfly room off to the side and a great display around christmastimecomparing it to botanical gardens in larger cities it's bigger than the one in washington dc if that matters to ya  reading the reviews it never even occurred to me that not all cities have one of these  hunh
1,conservatory (only)the conservatory was amazing this past weekend i don't know how people do it so well but whoever it is that the hotel hires each year to omit just the right amount of "holiday fragrance" into the air both in the hotel and the conservatory does an excellent job this year the air was filled with notes of vanilla and cinnamon  last yeat it was more pine  anyways this was the firs time i was able to take my mother to see the conservatory  the first piece that we looked at was a huge reindeer covered in pecans and adorned with all other types of flowers roses greenery and even some dried flowers  water was creating the illusion of canopy type wiring that would be used to attach flowers and things  it's hard to explain  there was a little water show going on in one of the exhibits  there were so many beautiful pointsettas and even some more interesting moving pieces to the displays in one of them were several penguins in what was an adorable arctic scene  it was too cute you had to see it yourself anyway it was very fun to see all of this going on i love that it's open 247 and that it's such an elaborate display i'm a fan of this conservatory you should check it out if you've never seen it before it is definitely a sight to see
1,place is great to check out anytime of year it's always so beautiful and amazing w what they have on display each time i come here  the last time i was here was in october and they had a really cute display for autumna nice little bridge that goes through the greenery and water fountains that shoot up and over the bridge as you're walking through& a giant bucket of bright green red and yellow apples flowing from it it was amazing (check out the pix i posted)it's a great spot for photos especially during the holidays and the greatest part about it is that it's free )
1,place is absolutely beautiful there was this butterfly theme when we went and it provided some interesting photo-ops this place is a must when in vegas so what are you doing go check it our for yourself
1,amazing and beautiful every time i've visited i have no idea how they find the time and artistry to pull off changing the theme every season but it's so great i make it a point to visit every time i go to vegas last time i went butterflies were the theme they even had a tiny greenhouse filled with live butterflies so pretty this time fall flowers pumpkins waterfall trees and large animated forest creatures filled the space it's the perfect place to stop and just enjoy something in vegas that has nothing to do with drinking or gambling plus there's tons of background for photo ops the only downside it gets crowded of course
1,conservatory at the bellagio was beautiful when i visited in november 2008  since it was the fall the conservatory had an autumn theme with wood nymphs and fall flowers and pumpkins  it presents the perfect photo op for tourists and thus can be quite crowded  around the corner is the patisserie where you can buy some gelato or a crepe and return to peruse the conservatory
1,plants and fauna inside a casino  it is awesome  just wild and i want to know what they do to protect the poor trees from the tourists smoke and awful awful chihuly shops  what a hackokay the chocolate stand around the corner with the huge chocolate waterfall was well i couldn't stop saying "augustus"the christmas decorations make it quite quaint and the little walkway that had tourists marching alongside nutcracker replicas 14' tall  they looked like cows marching to the abattoir plus the snowmen etc was incredibly festivelovelynot sure if it hit me right franklyanyhoo i have seen the room at day and night with and without the consumer driving holiday stimulus (people see ornaments and freak out and need to shop)i like it  a lot  it is living earthy grooviness inside a terrible naughty casino (which can also be nice)so visit it  it is the only free thing in vegas  besides dudes who click cards with their fingers for stripshowsthose guys *are* vegas
1,holiday decorations when we were there (early december 2008) it was pretty packed but what a joy to see check out my pictures
1,could theoretically walk through it without realizing you're walking through it  the bellagio as a whole is so oppulently decorated that you may just figure you've wandered into a particularly plant-filled section and pay it no mindrest assured you're in an actual conservatory  that's managed pruned and decorated  great for pictures decorated for holidays and a generally pleasant distraction from the smoky casino floor
1,the bellagio conservatory is a must see for anyone visiting vegas as a hawaii resident las is a home away from home for island folks we stopped by in nov 2008 to take in the fall displays amazing use of natural products it was a nice way to kick-off the holiday season
1,were here for chinese new year a couple of years ago  and we were just visiting again and saw this:http:wwwyelpcombiz_photosyzlgswawmpkmqifs3-yqtwselectooaxfbv0gdukv33l2bwgxai love this place  i wish it was bigger  people push and walk into your pictures  if you're losing your money in the casino tke a break and visit the conservatory  it'll get you away for a little bit
1,is a truly amazing oasis in a sea of cheese and debauchery  since we were sans little wee one on our naughty adult vacation to sin city we decided to pop over to the springs preserve and check it out  it's a relatively new desert botanical garden and learning center  hubby is a science teacher so he was way excited to get his science groove onwe went a little later than expected and only had a couple hours to spend but we easily could have spent at least 4 hours wandering the hiking trails and checking out the cool exhibits  basically this attraction has three partsorigin experience which has tons of cool interactive activities films and a little zoo of desert life desert lving center which is all about conservation and gardenstrails which is a bunch of interconnected trails  it was really cold when we were there so we didn't spend as much time as we like on the trailsif you have some time and want to get away for a bit from the smoke and vice of the strip check out the springs preserve it's really lovely
1,a few blocks from my apartment i expected this place to be out in the middle of nowhere or on the edge of town  today was the one-year anniversary of spring's preserve so i treated my roommate my son and i to attend the event (the fact that it cost $6 each instead of $1495 was a major reason why i was so nice)  while the crowds were outrageous today it did not detract from what the preserve has to offer overallthere are many different facets of this huge campus from the origen experience to the gardens on the outskirts of the property; each has something great to show and tell you  we started in the gardens examining the flora and fauna that is prevalant in this area  we were shown various ways to create a garden using plants that are meant to be here as well as planting veggies and fruits in new and interesting ways something i did not think could be done well around herewe ventured further into the preserve and found the ampitheater where a free ice-cream social was coinciding with live celtic and eventually blues musicians performing  what a great place this would be for a night of music and some food or drinks  we were told that the next week on father's day there would be a bbq blues and beer festival where the first 100 dad's got in for free  events like this are an excellent way to attract positive attention to such a wonderful placepast the ampitheater is the origen building where there are a multitude of displays that are interactive and interesting  educational video games occupy one room while a history of the area display with live actors playing a turn-of-the-century train ride scene are in another  beyond this room lies one of the most exciting parts of the experience: the flash flood room  only 30 people can go in at a time so expect a line  standing on a platform at the bottom of a mock wash you experience what it is like to be in the middle of a flash flood  my son was in the front row and he came out a little wetfurther along you will find a great insect reptile and mammal display that has many interesting specimens  we found that a few of the animals were dead however but this is not to be unexpected  one was a kangaroo mouse that was hidden away in his burrow (he may have been sleeping but we doubt it  the lizards were very excited to have visitors as you may see in one of the pictures i posted of the preserveexpect to spend at least 2-3 hours here  a lot of the activities are outside so apply sunscreen  water fountains are every where and most are very cold (moreso near the buildings)  we did not go into the main building where the gift shops and restaurants were but refer to other reviews as other yelper's have visited them  i will update when i return here again
1,would have to say this is probably the best way you can spend a nice afternoon there's a lot of fun games and the landscape is beautiful if you're looking for a place to go on a date this is itit's way cuteafter coming here once i thought it was so pretty i decided to do my photo project here there's a lot to learn here if you're into the whole saving the environment thing you'll love it i think its definitely worth paying to get into the different buildings
1,of my favorite places in vegas if you are visiting here and are not into gambling this is a nice alternative here you can learn about our ecosystem and cultural history enjoy art and walk through some pretty nice trails they also have some great exhibits and workshops supporting sustainable living
1,love this place how can you not enjoy the center of where las vegas started the best part about this place is the wolfgang puck balcony cafe where we get our favorite kobe burger and fries i think it's the best in vegas juicy medium burger the tender buttery meat really melts in your mouth the fries are long and crisp when you bite into them very gourmet  come here for july 4th and watch the scattered fireworks along the 10 mile strip with the las vegas philharmonic playing in the background you can definitely find us here at least once a month
1,06-jan-10   the last time we visited the springs preserve it was in the middle of a very hot summer day  so we couldn't really spend much time outside   but we vowed to come back in the winter and i am really glad we did   the indoor displays are really pretty neat   but being able to see the outside displays and nature trails was just awesome   it was kind of nice to just walk around in the cool air  it was like a small slice of nature in the city   great job guys
1,little gem in the desert
1,in hawaii you pretty much are limited to the things you can doplaces you can see well other than sunning at our beautiful beaches and everything outdoors  for families in hawaii there is the usual "you-can-never-go-wrong-with" waikiki zoo or waikiki aquarium etc to frequent at least a million times in your lifetime (or your kids' lifetimes)here in las vegas the place to take the family is the springs preserve  heck  better yet  get an annual membership there  you will never tire of the place  the place is packed with so much to do  the springs preserve is not your typical museum  in a nutshell it is a cultural institute of las vegas' history and its move towards a promising future of sustainability with all its natural resources that is available in las vegaswho said that learning is not fun  there is so much to learn about las vegas and you can find it here  the one thing i as well as my 8-year old son have learned about the most for instance is the creation and history of the aquifers in the valley  yes you heard that right  there is water in this here desertfrom classes and workshops to events and concerts the springs preserve offers a wealth of information - and they do it in such a fun and natural way  what we like best of all are the live desert animal exhibits to view the gardens to stroll through and trails to walk and the kids' playground area to rest and relax in  and when it's time to grab a bite you can't go wrong with the springs cafe by wolfgang puckwe just renewed our annual membership which for families is $60 basic value package or $25 for individuals  we were just there last night for the haunted harvest a festival of games trick or treatin' performances and fun  they even had a haunted maze  we can't wait to go back for their next spectacular holiday eventthe winter lights festival  it's gonna be beautiful and amazing as ever  see you all there
1,of my top favorite places to be in vegas  extremely beautiful gardens and nostalgic museums  the art and architecture is impressive and the staff has always been friendly  the annual membership is completely worth it as the park changes with the seasonsand the festivals are always fun  perfect place for any age with or without kids
1,hidden gem in the desert  lots of interactive exhibits and a neat bird show  very pleasant staff  we went for free as part of bank of america's museums on us program http:museumsbankofamericacomwe got there when it opened and buzzed through within 2-12 hours because we were in a hurry to get to a showlots to see so we will try to stop back in the future
1,place to bring your kids in the middle of winter when it's too cold out to do anything winter bonuses include: no tourists + the tropical dome is like taking a mini holiday in the caribbean
1,we're being completely honest in our choice of terms there are few "world-class" destinations in any given city the biodome is one such place in montreal where else can you walk through 4 ecosystems in 1-2 hours and really get a feel for each one's particularitieswhere else can you learn something on every visit whether you're 2 16 35 or 60 years old where else takes an already awesome concept and execution and creates special theme events to make the experience even more amazing yeah i'm talking about the night visits where you get to see things in a completely different light - if you'll forgive the pun the biodome is one of montreal's "must sees" if you're visiting just go if you're lucky enough to live here (and sometimes i need a reminder about that) go and take in the experience and then start thinking of your return trip i am constantly amazed and proud of this world class montreal site
1,place for family and kids penguins and monkeys birds and fishes all under the same roof
1,been to a few bio-domes and this one is very well organized there is a central hub where you can go to the different climate areas the new aquarium exhibit though not yet complete is very nice very family friendly just wish it wasn't such an unusual walk to get there
1,stars for the penguin areato see the penguin close up is so worth it if you love penguin if will love this place all other area is nothing special
1,there were lynx kittens what else do i need to sayparked on street and walked over very cool experience the more time you spend the more you will see very cool zoo experience
1,a great place to visit this is the coolest reused building i've ever been into (it was the velodome of the '76 olympic games) the habitats were well put together and the animals seemed to have enough space to hide and be seen the rainforest is really really hot the bat exhibit was cool (and scary) and the penguins were delightful i loved how the birds could all fly and that it actually rained in parts of the dome it is an aza accredited facility and the docentskeepers were all very helpful i will definitely be back on our next trip to montreal
1,is a wowwowplacea must visit for all tourists of montrealthe habitats are very well establishedthe animals feel more naturalthe temperature is controlled for each habitatmoving from the rainy humid dim lighted tropical forests to the othersthe animals are not enclosed except for fishesbats nd penguins :pbut they are at a safe height or distanceyou wouldnt find lions or tigersbut whatever they have its enough to keep you feel that its worth the money spent
1,walked in to the conservatory proper and immediately i felt like i was in eden a pair of butterflies fluttered by as soon as we entered a wave of humidity hit me and my surroundings all of a sudden became lush and green i was stunned by the birds and butterflies that roamed freely throughout the small conservatory it was an awesome feeling and there's nothing else like it if you're still enough the butterflies will obliviously land on you there's an area where the butterfly chrysalises hang and if you're lucky you'll even see butterflies emerging from their slumber
1,well thought out greenspace various different areas each with its own character you can be busy with other people or find a secluded shelter for some peace and quiet watch out for the kamikaze squirrels though wonderful glasshouse but with an entry fee cafe a bit expensive so bring a lunchsome nice events take place here so watch out for those
1,is something special about being able to step into a building from a busy bustling and noisy city center - and be transported to a quiet alive and organic rainforest of plants trees and flowersthe royal botanic garden is one such way that you can experience this feeling - the gardens located in the city center are huge spread out across a massive piece of land and both indoors in a huge green house and out in the gardens outside the garden is particularly pleasent in the summer where the sun shines the flowers bloom and generally you will feel one with nature there is nothing better than spending a lazy day here just wandering about admiring the plants and watching the world go by
1,have mentioned in previous reviews than i am very green fingered indeed i just love foliage so royal botanic gardens was always going to be a winner in my book established in 1670 the royal botanic gardens is very lush indeed and up there with the finest display of shrubbery in the world picture perfect on a summer's day when all the flowers are in bloom it is absolutely free to enter and did you know that the largest palm tree in any greenhouse in britain is housed right here that was your useless fact of the day in addition to this there's also the famous rock garden and an award winning collection of rhododendrons
1,a lover of rich vegetation a lover of ponds and a lover of swans there's only ever going to be one result in my review for the botanic gardens it's a wonderful way to spend a sunny day and far more civilised and tranquil than the cider-swilling meadowsat a b&b in oban i once saw some prizewinning rhododendrons and the bad boys on show in here are the first i've seen that could compete with the finest the rural west coast has to offer so full of wonderful purple colour they actually stain the surrounding leavesnow that's proper horticulture for you
1,been visiting the botanic garden ever since i was knee high and it never ceases to capture my imagination and wonder from it's palm houses to inverleith house at the heart of the gardens every acre is filled with peace and tranquility in the middle of this metropolis i now take my kids to the gardens and to see them feed the squirrels and pigeons and to tumble and rush through the fallen leaves in autumn as i used to do myself is priceless
1,botanic gardens are beautiful and a real gem within edinburgh it is free entry so you really have got nothing to lose by coming here no matter what time of the year you goobviously the spring and the autumn are the best times to go where you can see all the flowers in full bloom or to see the beautiful display the trees put on in september however even if you go in the winter the greenhouses are kept at really humid conditions allowing all types of plants to prosper as well as giving you somewhere nice and warm to go in the cold monthsthe gardens are well kept and are very clean and there is a cafe towards the middle of the area if you want to stop for a cup of coffee and a snack the grounds are also very easy to navigate around due to an abundance of signs and maps
1,love this place for the pigeons and squirrels they are friendly and love getting fed many will pose for photos and eat from your hand
1,botanic garden in edinburgh is about as close to heaven as it's possible to get in the city  outstandingly beautiful and peaceful with an attractive array of wildlife including some very friendly squirrels who will eat out of your hand if you're patient enough - though be warned they will bite if they feel threatenedthere is a restaurant on the grounds which is ridiculously overpriced and a not inexpensive shop but the shop is good for souvenirs and if you take a picnic with you there are plenty of places you can enjoy it  the arboretum is spectacular though not cheap but you don't need to visit it to enjoy the gardens and entrance is freemy favourite part has to be the chinese garden with its bamboo and waterfalls though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and you can easily spend an entire day out there  not to be missed
1,place was absolutely incredible  i visited in late march but it seems to be the kind of place that has a different style of beauty at different points  i'll talk about my two favorite parts: the greenhouse gardens and the general gardens (specifically the 'rock hill garden')walking into each greenhouse was like discovering a whole new world  ranging from tropical rooms covered in brilliant flowers and lush vines to a desert room with cactus  my only regret is that i wasn't able to run around and frolic among the plants like a little kid  i have to say my favorite greenhouses were probably 8 and 10  8 had a ton of carnivorous plants and orchids (which are awesome) and 10 had an amorphophallus titanum a plant that grows an absolutely gigantic flower unfortunately it is in the beginning stages of this years growth but that's just an incentive to come back :)the rock hill garden was both visually stunning and a great place for children to play  while i was there a wedding was being held and children were running around having a wild time  if you have kids take them here they will love it  from the top of the hill you can see the edinburgh skyline complete with castle trust me its worth seeing
1,too many rhododendrons for me but - am i going to knock a star off what is a lovely tranquil space to spend a day not i said the fly i haven't visited rbge since i was kneehigh to a lawnmower when we went to the glasshouses to learn about the rainforest and the threat to it's existence (how times have changed eh eh) and tried dried mango for the first time roll on twenty-something years and it's taken into our heads to revisit and it really hasn't changed in any way it's still beautiful although i swear it was all indoors the last time i visited honest for the tourist wanting to do something not directly on the main drag or the local wanting somewhere pleasant to picnic in the town you can't really go wrong enjoy
1,the reviews of casbah appear to be particularly long-winded  the place is nice fancy organic-ish alternating menu nice atmosphere good date restaurant good food-lovers restaurant
1,went to casbah for brunch it's a $22 prix-fix which includes an alcoholic bev an appetizer and an entree they use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies i had the house made granola which was just amazing toasty and sweet it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box also while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch you get a lot a food after the great pastry basket my appetizer a bellini and a cup of coffee i had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag ("the rest" included fruit salad potatoes and a croissant)my only complaint would be how long everything took while i love a leisurely meal an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive i go into brunch groggy then i have coffee and yummy food and i'm totally amped ready to face the day and then i get to sit and wait anyway it's totally not a big deal now i'll know to make time the next time i go which is for dinner for a friends birthday so excited
1,was pleased to finally find a place in pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money i tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing i could have made the meal better myself not herethe food is made to order seasonal local some organicin short they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today i had made it a point to never eat fish in a pittsburgh restaurant but casbah changed my mind the cod dish i had was delicious--not overcooked breaded too oily or too salty decor is subtle and great for a date service was friendly and accommodating  i will most definitely return
1,great for parties and celebrations of all kinds  the wait staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list  the food is creative and many of the items are organic or locally grown  everything is so fresh and pretty you almost don't want to eat it  the wine list is extensive and although it can be pricey they have great happy hour specials
1,is my favorite big burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country gotta be honest though just about every time i'd been here it's with colleagues which means lots and lots of boozing therefore consequently as a result in sum i don't have a crystal clear memory of what i had for appetizer entree dessert etc what i can tell you is that i had never been disappointed with anything i've ordered here and believe you me if the food is not that good i will remember it no matter how drunk i am sure it's not exactly a "mediterranean" restaurant but who cares the food is great it's in a super cute hood the atmosphere is cozy and comfy and the service is always spot on i do recall that the very last time i ate here was with a dear friend and two of her british colleagues and we had ourselves a grand ol' time i had the arugula --one of my favorite words it's lovely no say it with me a -ru-gu-la fun right and so flavorful --salad and cioppino which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients what about dessert you ask sorry kids by that time i really was drunk and i can't remember it was super tasty though i remember everyone liking mine the best sure do sugarso pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl it's a great date or small group place oh and super fantastic wine list too
1,place for brunch  for $22 i had a mimosa; cheese fruit and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin scone and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket  service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy  reservations available through open table  this is definitely a special occasion brunch but it is surprisingly affordable
1,of my all time favorite restaurants in pgh casbah is still going strong 15 years later today's lunch was a wonderful mac and cheese with braised lamb; my dining companion enjoyed the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad they use the best fresh local ingredients to craft some of the most delectable interesting fresh food around  also great for sunday brunch  you won't be disappointed
1,excellent brunch spot  for review 100 a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fittingcasbah does brunch lunch and dinner but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best  i ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer brunch dish and drink for $22  i started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink  my companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup wild mushroom omelet and a glass of fresh orange juicewhile waiting for our food we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins scones and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butterthe smoked salmon came with capers minced red onion crumbled egg a drizzle of aioli and a beautiful fried potato cake  there was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon  i tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavormy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs  i love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts  the braised lamb shoulder was flavorful tender and super rich  the best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit  this dish itself is enough to make me a regular  i tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (i think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good tooservice was good ambiance was good portions were big quality was excellent and they take reservations  sometimes i don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (point brugge coca cafe etc) but most times i'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside especially now with winter approaching
1,a pleasure to dine on my birthday at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in shadyside we planned in advance to come here after i received big burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks the food--short rib ravioli lamb and polenta pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent perfect for a celebratory meal our server made some clutch drink recommendations too my favorite: the local martini all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives almost like a cocktail and small plate in oneafter reading everyone else's reviews i hope to come back here next for brunch**to take big burrito up on this offer join their mailing list decently before your birthday and a voucher will come in the mail it was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students
1,a big fan of all the big burrito restaurants i've tried (eleven umi mad mex & casbah) i think eleven is my favorite but casbah is a very close second my most recent trip was with my wife on 11510 we started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli for entrees i had the casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta for dessert i had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream  cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich) the grilled flat bread came with three different dips humus red pepper hummus and baba ganoush i really enjoyed all three but thought the red pepper hummus stood out as the best although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree the butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much but my wife really liked it as far as the entrees we both really enjoyed our meals my pork chop was cooked perfectly and was anything but dry the sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor the sides were kale and butternut squash risotto both of which really shined i can't describe how amazing the risotto was and the kale was extremely flavorful i tried my wife's pasta dish and overall i thought it was good but the sausage was really outstanding incredibly tender and flavorful neither of us were too impressed with our desserts the creme brulee was very good but at that point i expected it to be great my wife's dessert sort of disappointed since the cookies were dry the bill for everything listed above plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip so it is pricey but in my opinion totally worth it also our server was very attentive and helpful without being intrusive i asked his opinion on the french malbec and he gave me his honest opinion which was negative
1,food is pricey but out of this world try their beef tenderloin ala blue topped with gorgonzola dolce and sweet onion marmalade and served with pancetta and spring pea risotto it melts in your mouth my friend also enjoyed the wild boar - sounds crazy but delicious
1,a number of the best meals in my life came courtesy of the fantastic chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at blue whether for birthdays work meetings or just a desire for a nice night out blue never disappointed and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasionsthe staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners everyone treats you with a high level of respect and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there after a few visits i found one waiter i liked even more than the others and i would always request his table when i came with no problem from the scheduler don't forget if you bring your own wine (which i do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter not that you need to bring wine to blue because they have a wine list that is second to none (well maybe bonterra) in charlotteit's hard to recommend specific dishes at blue because i've had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons it's a mediterranean style of cuisine so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get and an emphasis on great sauces perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of osso bucco served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes with a crab and lobster risotto on the side pure decadence if you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing i would suggest getting over anything else as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass the duo of bison cuts is another one i would highly recommendthe cheese selection at blue is also top-notch there are usually 15-20 to choose from including several expensive bleu cheeses which are fortunately all the same price here it comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side and unlike many other restaurants doesn't cost extra another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down hearty bread and the most wonderful spread i've ever tasted it's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptiedbe sure to save plenty of room for desert as well (blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the charlotte area and for those of you that don't go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream one of my favorites
1,atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that i will definitely be back the food was good the mediterranean salad was amazing that dressing was tasty and not overbearing the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as i hoped for then again i can't expect miracles from chicken the desert (tres leches) was great super sweet so not for everyone but tasty
1,have been here twice both times with a large group & we had a private room  service was excellent as was the food  i always recommend this place to anyone visiting charlotte & they always tell me how much they loved it
1,like blue not sure why i don't get here too often (the price may be a big weigher)last time i was here is for a friend's birthday celebration i ordered the sea bass and yum i almost lick my plate if only my momma didn't teach me well my companions got moroccan chicken and some part of pig on a bone yes they both are also yummy (i'm a forker and good at it) but definitely glad i didn't lick my plate because then i had room for dessert they were nice enough to put all three desserts (chocolate moose lemon bar and chocolate molten cake) on a beautiful plate with candle on it we unanimously agreed we will claw each other for the lemon bar waitress was really nice and attentive so definitely come and visit blue get some wine and lemon bar while listening to jazz
1,setting big restaurant but great service mediterranean halibut was killer - in a soup  major dipping action  a gem
1,wife and i goto blue several times a year (mostly for special occasions and what not)they've never put a foot wrongthe service is impeccable the wine list is extensive the martinis delicious the food delectablemy absolute favorite has to be the summer seasonal pork milanese  had the tenderloin last time and was suitably sated
1,i have eaten here a hand full of times and the food and service has always been out of this world this is actually one of my favorite places to get fillet mignon although i have tried many other things on the menu though; like the wild boar - which will blow your mind regardless i think you would be hard pressed to find bad food here the only disappointment i have ever experienced with this place is that they serve foie gras i am sure they make what is considered "good foie gras" but i just think it is cruel in terms of what they have to do to the poor duckgoose to make this dish as far as the feel of the place although it is upscale i find it to be a bit more casual than formal with low light and deep tranquil colors it is relaxing; setting a good stage for conversation another great date place in my book
1,been to blue twice to entertain clients for dinner and both times the restaurant exceeded my expectations  first they are extremely accomodating to large groups and easy to make reservations with  the staff is top notch with impeccable service and i was very pleased to see that they knew the extensive wine list and every detail of the menu to a tee which should be a given at a restaurant of this caliber but i'm always surprised at how many places this doesn't hold true  onto the food we started with the arancini (sp) balls - yum they are a must have and our table enjoyed the calamari and scallops as well  for dinner several people at our table had the wild boar (two ways) which i got to taste and it was amazing definitely one of the best things on the menu  i opted for the duck bolognese the first time and was not disappointed; the sauce pasta duck and even the fried egg on top were all cooked perfectly with flavors that blended exceptionally well  during my most recent visit i had the lamb tagine which was not only spectacular in presentation but also in flavor  it's a hefty portioncooked over cous cous with fruits and veggies - it was so tender is just slid off the bone  to finish all the desserts were great and i highly recommend blue for just about anything - a date business dinner special occasion or just a drink at the bar  enjoy
1,took my husband to blue last week to celebrate his birthday and we both loved it  the waiter we had was very helpful and proceeded to give us a list of his favorite menu items as soon as we sat down  his input deemed extremely useful since my husband loved the dish he recommendedwe decided to order the cheese platter and were very pleased with it  although the cheese that the waiter described as "stinky cheese" was pretty mild it was still pretty flavorful  the lamb shank that i ordered was cooked perfectly in fact it was so perfect that the meat was falling off the bone  as a disclaimer i will start by saying that i don't eat pork (i know i know) but the pork shoulder that my husband ordered was phenomenal  the risotto that comes with the dish was also fantastic  it was simple yet very flavorfulthe only complaint that i have about this restaurant is its dessert  we ordered the cake di chocolate and were terribly disappointed by it  this chocolate cake just falls short  if you decide to try a dessert at this restaurant i would definitely recommend that you try something else (especially is you love chocolate)
1,loved love this place  it's kind of like a cafe style restaurant with a glass cheese display  the owner is a humble republican state senatorafter a few glasses of wine he probably gets cornered quite a bit  anywayi was on a date  this is a great date place  we ordered pairings of cheeses and wines that are already selected for you  we each got our own tastes (3 each)  we shared each other's cheese and wine  the service is so so but nothing to complain about really  after our cheese tasting i ordered the salmon  it was cooked very well with fresh vegetablesgreat placeand i look forward to my next visit in phoenix to come back here
1,of all the wine bars i've been to in the phoenix area (not counting divine wine in mesa) this is my favorite hands down the people are friendly the room is spacious the wine selection is supple & the atmosphere is cozy the last time i went was after dinner at panino on central my date and i went into the wine bar to sample a selection he chose his with cheese i did not my wine was incredible we were able to relax on the couch continue our conversation while having amazing wine at our fingertips i was giddy with pleasure to top it off the bathroom is unisex and sneaky behind a wall without a handle you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way while waiting for an open room (there are two private bathrooms once you're inside) a couple men profusely apologized evidently they thought they were in the wrong bathroom little did they know i would go back here in a heartbeat in fact i've been thinking of going soon - it's a perfect place for a date since there's plenty of room to sit and an atmosphere conducive to conversation forget kaz try cheuvoront instead
1,food great presentation and sleek space - with no wait on a saturday night  huh  yes you read that right  after taking in the body worlds exhibit (what else does someone do after seeing dead bodies  have dinner of course) at the az science center we headed to pizzeria bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 35 hours (phoenix's equivalent of bridge and tunnel were at pb in full effect) for food especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile  so off to cheuvront it was and what a great dinner it wasatmosphere - 5 starsfood - 475 starsservice - 375 starsoverall - 45 starsthis is my third visit over the past few years and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd  i'm not sure why this is  i've never heard anything bad about this place so i suspect az state senator cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction  their loss should be your gain as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine  even one of my dining guests visiting from new york city was impressedthe sexy modern space on the first floor of the artisan lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate  we sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables  cool touch  we started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a french charcuterie plate of a pate mousse cornichons (i have a weakness for salty gherkins) two cheeses marinated artichokes asparagus kalamata olives smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette  what a great way to start a dinner ehour main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint  i ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese  those thangs weren't shrimp  these mofos were giant tiger prawns and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction  heaven  the macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: quebec cheddar comte and a dry jack cheese bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly and surprisingly fresh  additionally i had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat  price for 3 people (apps entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115  average entree - $16  not bad methinksmy only complaint would be the service  it was very good for the most part but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes  in his defense though he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'c') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions additionally the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial i'm eager for my next visit so i can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section but i would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up
1, i'm in love  if only i lived closer to cheuvront  maybe i'll move downtown just to be closermy husband and i went in on a saturday night for a few glasses of wine  once we saw the desserts however we knew we had to try it  i ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was very good (it wasn't the harvard faculty club but then againwhat is) and my husband selected the coconut pie  both servings were huge and covered in whipped cream  they were fantastic  finally a place to go for dessert herewe chose to sit at the bar and the bartender was amazing  he offered us complimentary tastings of two delicious dessert wines and then even offered us a complimentary mini cheese sampler with an amazing sheep's milk cheese  the atmosphere was perfect it was laid back kind of cafebistro-ish but still modern  they were playing the food network which i absolutely lovedi've never seen that in a restaurant before it was a great touch   the wine list is extensive and reasonably pricedthey have a wonderful wine dinner with four courses for only $55 a person  i'm eager to attend one in the future and i definitely plan on going back for dinner in the near futureand that folks was my 400th review :)
1,search is overi have found my favorite wine bar in the valley comfortably situated on central avenue slightly south of mcdowell it's a quiet chic space that i think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months the wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes i've had the kim crawford sauvignon blanc before which was good and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me the second white i had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender jeffi told him what kind of wine i liked and he hand-selected one for me to try it's not on the "wine by the glass" menu so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass i love when places do that  the beer list while small has all of my favorite imports so thumbs up on that as wellthe first time i dined at cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and i started with the brillat savarin which was creamy and very much like brieit was delicious i loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left  i felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer for dinner i had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day  i took a bite of my friend's pizza chevre which was really good and hearty  i most recently dined at cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change  everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered i had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad the mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy  prices are very reasonable for both wine and foodcheuvront is a great spot for lunch dinner or just to sit at the bar and try a new wine or two  i know i will be there in the future especially with kristin s moving so close to it
1,far as wine and cheese bars go - this place has postino's beat by a long shot  the wine list is impressive  the staff can make recommendations on the fly  the owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines  the food is out of this world - but unpretentious   you don't have to travel to scottsdale to get fine food and drink -- we've got it right here in central phoenix at cheuvront   with that said - try the macaroni and cheese - which is what i tried tonight - out of this world albeit a little spicy  i've eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because i'm so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine  my new favorite
1,dear god i'm in lovepeppered filet and martini scallop dreams fill my mind blue cheese stuffed olives in my martini what shut the fuck up sooooo amazing quality all the way i had a glass of byron pinot noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert (i prefer to drink my desert) great romantic spot to bring a date secures that you will be getting action later trust me if you see me at cheuvront stop by and say hello i'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese no joke
1,take my wife here all the time  it's a great date place  the food is always good and the staff is always knowledgeable of the wines and paring them with foods  we haven't had a bad glass or bottle yet  my wife likes to order their cherry lemon drop martini and i have to admit i enjoy it toothe food is always prepared with care and i've always enjoyed a cheese plate or a flight of wines with their recommended cheese pairingsi would like to extend my kudos to barry  he is the reason i kept returning as he has what it takes to take the front of the house experience to the next level
1,is a gem  their wine selection is superb and their cheeses are tough to trump  i have always been treated to wonderful service and taste treats  i also love that they have such a wonderful champagne by the glass selection  the laurent-perrier is by far the best and i love that they have it in splits  always something to look forward to when traveling to phoenix
1,a if you impress me with a chicken breast you are doing a damn good job b spanish plate with manchego serrano date-bread and all types of other goodness  epicc basil and gin martini wtf so odd but awesome and i hate ginhttp:wwwyelpcombiz_photoshu6sn5r6vayqm_rmgvpgoqselect1641pje2bhjbwtd1t6z2pad todd and the nice manager lady both good peoples c did i mention amazing chicken breast yes i am actually raving about chicken granted chicken with lemon piccata capers arugula and home made 'gnocchi' which were more like a pretzel bread than a gnocchi but none the less amazingd oh and pumpkin bread pudding wow effing wow go for the page-long cheese menu and affordable yet varied wine selection  i can not believe this place has been here for five years and i just now visited it the spanish plate two cocktails two glasses of wine two entrees and a desert was only a bill cant get that in la
1,grown up in a city with a large traditional italian neighborhood full of large traditional italian restaurants the first thing i tried to find in phoenix was a good plate of tortellini and a decent piece of veal genovese  i found them at christosthe atmosphere at christos is very traditional white tablecloth stemware cloth napkin and flower centerpieces  it feels special when you come here for a meal but the meal is very reasonably pricedthe menu is traditional with dishes like pasta primavera linguine with clam sauce chicken or veal saltimbucca canneloni chicken eggplant or veal parmigiana  they have cioppino decent salads and a good wine list  what more could you ask for
1,have to sayi have been going to this ristorante for the past twenty years with my family  every time we go there we have the same server  we are always greeted well and the alfredo is amazing and so is the sea bass  the halibut and  veal chop  the homemade house salad dressing is one of a kind too  the new bar lounge area is nice and the pianist is a nice touch  love christo's
1,is not too often i am overly impressed however christo's did just that yesterday when i had lunch theremy boss decided to take me and 2 of my coworkers to lunch for my birthday he (my boss) really had some making up to do since last year he got me a 50 cent crappy brownie and put a candle in it and sang me happy birthday he was definitely in the dog house so i knew this year he was going to bring his a-gamehopefully his choice is restaurants leaves a bit to be desired of course i did some research and christo's appeared to be ok so i felt a little at ease this timei get there early and wait for my party the hostess is very nice and she knows many of the people that are coming in as they are regulars i have not seen anything like this since leaving home (nyc) old world charm restaurants where they know you and you know them i can't believe it i grew up around very good italian food i have been to a few places here that italians have recommended and it was just not up to par now mind you none of these italians were east coast italians it is something to be said of italian food on the east costmy party finally comes and we are seated the place is very nice with the traditional white table cloths our server comes over and he is happy and attentive he gets our drinks and comes back to take our appetizer order we get the calamari of course omg the best i have ever had it was lightly breaded and the marinara sauce was great it was all i could do not to eat the whole thing our server comes back to tell us about the specials which btw were all fish dishes i went with the red snapper mussels linguine with marinara and capers nobody ordered the same thing which is great cause that means we can share the salads come out first and they are pretty basic but the dressing was great ohh the bread was amazing jeez it is so hard to stop eating bread and butter i was trying to save room for the rest of the meal our food comes out at the perfect time our fantastic server sets our plates out but before he gets to my co-workers plate this guy comes out and grabs his plate then brings it back in a matter of seconds i thought wow the cook does not want stuff coming out the kitchen unless it is perfect come to find out it was christo himself that came out to fix my co-workers dish looking around at the other plates i am thinking wow everything looks so amazing the other thing is the portions were right on i hate going to places and the have so much food it is ridiculous the linguine was cooked perfectly the server came over with extra cheese and of course a must have for me fresh cracked pepper it was one of those times i did not want to share anything with anyone at the table i did not want to disturb my palate from the wonderful flavors of my dish i was thinking everyone else was thinking the same thing because no one was sharing well shortly after every plate on that table was completely cleaned the server was on point with filling our drinks i never had a glass that was less than half full also i have waited tables and it is a fine line between being a pest and being helpful and friendly lets just say the servers at christo's have this down perfectly well the plates are cleaned up and out comes this cute little cup of vanilla and chocolate mousse with a candle in it compliments of the kitchen since it is my b-day well is was great i am not really into mousse because it is a texture thing but the flavor was awesome i still got to order dessert i got the flan others had key lime pie and ny cheesecake ohh decisions a toss between cheese cake and flan well flan won i practically licked the caramel sauce off the bottom of the plate it was the best i have had here ohh nyc christo's has brought a little of you back to me sniff sniff tears of joy i am so happy i found a fantastic italian restaurant
1,let me get it right out there this fabulous local spot in the same strip center as my own business but after years of eating here i am not sure why they fly so far under the radar with the "foodie" crowd the service is top notch (and ya know i'm a picky girl about this) some of the servers have been there since the place openedit is family owned and operated and they insist on high quality ingredients the prices are fair and the portions are large i am a huge fish fan and these guys  deliver up some amazingly well prepared mediterranean style fish dishes they serve soup and salad with their entrees and the bread is worth the splurgei enjoy their wine selection and this summer there is a great wine special mondays through thursdays i invite all my foodie friends to give it a try
1,went there for a family birthday and it was great  i was the only male out of the 6 people in attendance and these women love to talk  we were there an hour and half after closing talking and the staff was totally cool  i felt bad for staying so long but the staff kept telling us not to worry about itgreat food great service
1,usually reserve five stars for places like kai but for the price this restaurant deserves five stars  this is an excellent restaurant and that is definitely rare in phoenix  we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine while waiting for another couple to arrive and we were never rushed or made to feel like we were a bother because we didn't order any food for the first 45 minutesthe sea bass special was some of the moistest fish i have ever eaten  i am amazed at how they were able to cook such a thick cut perfectly--not one part was over- or under-done  it was served on a bed of pasta and topped with a marinara sauce that was delicious  the entire dining experience was very pleasant  no complaints
1,friends turned me on to this restaurant years ago and while i have since left az they still live there go to this restaurant and still love the consistently great food  this was one of my favorite restaurants when i lived there  they made perhaps the best cannelloni (melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness) and avgolemeno soup (only rival i've found is taverna tony in malibu)  in fact we had them cater my daughter's bat mitzvah receptionthey were that good  i'm just sad i haven't been able to enjoy their food since leaving az  in addition to always getting their cannelloni and avgolemeno soup i used to get their lemon dill salmon chicken limone chicken genovese or shrimp scampi  i know i'll be back to phoenix one of these days and when i do this place will surely be on my list of "to-do's"
1,and service was awesome the best fish and soup the included salad was very basic but good and fresh for the price we paid my wife and i never had such good food we both had the dover sole and it was great with perfect service we both can't wait to return and try the other items
1,a great meal i had the poached salmon one of the best in a long time as usual service was great and the food was outstanding can't wait to try his sea bass 
1,love christos i recommend the pomodoro pasta it is so light fresh and delicious christos is ny favorite
1,b has me very confused:  you can get a sandwich & a drink for like under $10 bucks  the duckall the sandwiches are handmade right in front of your very face -- any time a restaurant prepares the food where the whole wide world can watch them do it tells me they're proud of their work & their food  and they should be -- it's great  they even have each pickle wedge individually wrapped in foil -- take as many as you want (within reason)   :-)i've been a customer of the duck since long before most of you moved to phoenix  consistency -- nice people excellent food reasonable prices wide selections of wines & soft drinks seating indoors - outdoors - upstairs  no worries - the duck is always good
1,and decanter "the duck" is freaking awesome  i like the store like atmosphere and the friendly staff  aside from fabulous sandwiches and sides they have lots of other great stuff too  they have unique dishes gormet foods and sodas  the duck also have a large wine room and beer selection  they can get busy during lunch but the staff are very friendly and quickthis is a great place to grab a handmade sandwitch and snoop threw the store while you wait
1,for the first time yesterday for lunch it was soooo good there is a wine  beer bar adjacent to the main retail  deli area lots of unique gifts  artisanal cheeses and more i was amused that they take your lunch order on a brown bag and put your lunch in it had an excellent roast beef sandwich and sat out front (note for summer: they only have outdoor seating) clean friendly and delicious check it out
1,food ever no  value for price through the roofthis is an awesome lunch stop for those on a budget and they happen to stock a respectable beer selection to boot  mmmm hacker-pschorr hefeweizen on tap
1,the sandwiches  love that they sometimes have live music outside  love that it's called duck and decanter  what the heck is that anyway :)they also have the best horseradish in the world  if you like hot this is hot
1,love visiting d & d this place is about the atmosphere as well as the food on the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate america moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks it make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch on the weekends there are families dogs children babies old folks young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend there are misters around the patio areai love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside the sandwiches are good i love the turkey on dark rye with avocado they are generous on all fronts yes the place is pricey drinks sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people however you get a free small concert on the weekends the kids run loose the dogs bark and it is fun the wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years this is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich this is a place to have fun relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere
1,and decanter is one of those places where while eating your meal you suddenly think "wait am i still in phoenix" this place is so unlike anything else in midtown phoenix that going there for the atmosphere is half the pleasure it's part sandwich shop part eclectic boutique part wine cellar part loft and some other things thrown in too tucked away in a corner of a generic strip mall the place looks like someone's house from the 70's hard to describe once you enter there is a counter where you place your order with a little salad case a cheese case and a dessert case once you get your sandwich (or salad) you can either sit outside on the patio or take the stairs up to the upper dining area or sit on the upper deck outside patio and yeah the sandwiches can get a bit pricey but like i said half the fun of the place is the atmosphere i've always enjoyed my sandwich it's not like i'm paying for something i don't like the breads and the 'fixin's' have always been fresh and full of flavor go get a sandwich do a little browsing relax and take in some people watching and if you can figure out what city the place reminds you of please let me know cause it's not phoenix for sure
1,love the duck my mom has taken me here for years growing up and i always loved their sammies and pickles this last weekend a friend hosted a bridal shower for me on the patio and it was an amazing timei didn't know you could reserve a private patio and it had the perfect mix of sun and shade we had sammies and fruit salad catered and bought a few bottles of champagne what else do you really need for a good timewe ended up staying a little longer than our 3 hour reservation and never felt any pressure to hurry up or leave we still heard the live music and got the energy of the other patrons while having our privacyfood was tasty as always fresh veggies hearty bread and i love that pine nuts are in the veggie one of the best lunch spots ever
1,really had no idea what i was getting myself into when i went to duck and decanter  i'd seen the sign as i would drive south on the 51 and think "i like duck and i really like wine this place would be perfect for me"  as it turns out i wasn't quite wrong but it was not at all what i expectedthe duck and decanter is a strange blend of deli gourmet food and kitchen wares store as well as wine shop  it all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area  you definitely feel as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be  wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard i was really struck by how unique this place felt in phoenix  care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here but the quality of food presented to the customerwhen i finally got around to the deli counter i was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when i saw they had a reuben  as i find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere i asked the woman behind the counter what she advised  without hesitation she said "the reuben"  just as i had hoped and i'm glad i listened  the sandwich was excellent  perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time  making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craftsitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed  but take care to go there when you have some time to really savor the place  like the wine there's much to enjoy here and it'd be a shame to miss any of it
1,bk army had a meetup with our leader the lad we follow and the listen to every weeknight at 9pm on channel 3 oh wait this suppose to be about the food not beverly kidd but she's so cuteok to the food its been about about two years since i have been to the the duck and i have to say i really need to come back sooner next time my usual fare is a roast beef or corned beef sandwich but this time i wen for the duck sandwich i can't believe that i waited this long to try out the signature meal you get to choose what you want a variety of cheese is accompanied by different mustards mayo and of course the tomatoes lettuce onions and of course almost every type of bread what is probably the most fascinating is the assembly process there are always at least five people assembling the orders three taking orders or getting the orders to the customer you order at one end wait around a but and pick up on the other end on between there are cookies sauces coffee pots and almost anything one could want to have a yummy meal then there is the stuff for the home kitchen or counter so to the review the duck sandwich was amazing going to have it again got mine on a croissant with a bit of mayo and mustard only got a half with a beer there is a small pub style corner with a smaller choice of beers this didn't damper the meal at all the place is always hopigng seems like seating upstairs overlooks the lower area and the outside always seems to have a couple of four legged companions that are sometimes as humorous as the owners the little fellas seem to know exactly how much they can annoy their larger counterparts this is one nice deli sandwich shop and gathering of just plain great folks oh yeah and beverly kidd was great fun to be with and eat with she also seemed to like the chocolate surprise cake i got for her opppss was that suppose to be kept quite
1,some time my idea of an absolutely perfect lunch was to go to vintage market get a great salad a plate of cheese and fruit and a bottle of wine  on a great weather day sitting outside and watching the people stroll by there isn't much better  mind you you can't do that often but it's wonderful when you can  it's the closest i've seen for feeling like you're sitting at a paris market outside a busy street  they have great sandwiches too  and if you aren't in the mood for my ideal lunch fantasy they can still help you pick out a great glass of wine to go with your sandwich before you run over to see a move at esplanade  or buy a whole bottle of wine to enjoy after the movie  i've always been given great assistance in picking out the perfect bottle  i can almost taste it now
1,been driving past sophie's for 3 years now and finally took the opportunity to go for happy hour on friday night they have half price bar appetizers and my husband and i split 3 dishes and were blown awaywe ordered the escargot which was very tender and delicious and had a very authentic rich flavour the smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side the most amazing dish we sampled was the noisettes de boeuf which is essentially small tender pieces of beef wrapped in very lean bacon in a dijon mustard sauce this was seriously the most amazing beef that i've ever had and i'm typically not a steak person we ended up ordering a second helping of it since it was really that goodwe finished off the night with a delectable creme brulee and it brought me back to my days living in france it was the perfect ending to an incredible mealthe owner of the restaurant is extremely friendly and sat down at the bar to chat with us for a while the bistro has a very warm and inviting atmosphere and the patio is beautiful at night this place isn't snobby like a lot of french restaurants and the staff is very responsivewe ended up spending about $100 between the drinks and 4 appetizers (btw - the mango martini is to die for) but the whole experience was really worth it tuesday night is ladies night with half-price wine by the glass and i'll be back again soon for thatkeywords: french food 85016 french cuisine biltmore area french bistro arcadia area french food
1, from start to finish this place was incredible  great french host (mgr)   great french waiter helpful and funny   the support staff was way above average always plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner i really like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables we were there about two hours this is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio  i'll be back soon just to visit these areas   we started with a nice bottle of french winefor the appetizer:brie en croutecreamy brie coated with toasted almond slivers andwrapped in puff pastry then baked served with toastedbaguettes and port reduction the main courses:poitrine de porc provencalepan roasted pork tenderloin crusted with herbs d'provenceand served with sweet corn and goat cheese polenta fritterssauteed pea tendrils with grape tomatoes and leek fondueandcoquille saint-jacques a la sophiepan seared sea scallops served over sauteed ricotta gnocchiwith a citrus and shaved fennel baby arugula saladfinished with tarragon beurre blancfor desert:raspberry bruleechambord soaked fresh raspberryinfused in vanilla creme brulee----- i need to get creative and come up with more birthday's anniversary's holidays or some other random reason to splurge on a place like this more often
1,is easily the best restaurant i have ever been toi love french food and this is the very best i have ever had amazing service (the owner is such a nice guy) amazing service and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic (perfect for a date)i agree with some of the other raters-- this place would get 10 stars if yelp would let me put 10 try the duck and the beef bourguignon
1,in one word  perfecti only go twice a year to celebrate the end of the fall and spring semesters  why  because i don't want it too become familiar or stale  yes it's expensive but you get what you pay for and sophie's doesn't disappointdining is an experience  you put on shined shoes and a tie and make reservations  i like to go around 5:30 because it's usually not that busy  the dining room is inviting calming welcoming  you can have a conversation without having to raise your voice  i always make it a point to try something way out of my comfort zone:lobster bisque -- the last thing i eat before i die sweet breads (aka brains) -- etherealgooey runny cheese -- salty and tangypate (goose liver) -- creamy and so flavorfulthings i wouldnt' have eaten in a million years are some of the best things i have ever eaten  sophie's just invites you to be daringdo you wait for your food  yes  but that is the best part  you can have a conversation with your date you can relax  they don't make you feel rushed so why should you take on the responsibility yourself  just enjoy yourself  the food is comingso many places are so desperate to turn over tables that diners adopt the same mentality  gotta get my food fast gotta eat it fast gotta get out of here  i love sophie's because i can take the time to appreciate everything  it is just so wonderful to find a place like that to look forward to every year  it's worth the wait
1,z and i met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time the weather was perfect the patio beautiful and the company was amazingtheir happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines all for $6 plus we tried the escargot pate and frites as well we spoke to chef who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items especially if you call a day or two in advance we topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles which capped off the evening on a perfect note
1,owner serge was very french but his head chef was not i loved that their head chef came from another culture he had fallen in love with french food so much so he had moved to france to study it there the dishes he created were perfectly delicous i remember his filet with crushed peppercorns; it was soft and buttery the peppercorns gave a kick without being overpowering the quail was delicate and succulent the salad with lavender honey vinaigrette was perfection his chocolate spice cake was phenomenal it contained seven spices i can't begin to describe the joy that cake brought to everyone it was unique it was at the time when chocolate souffles were at every french restaurant unfortunately he's not there anymore regardless my rating will remain until i have a chance to go back and say otherwise
1,is good it's not cheap and the atmosphere isn't real trendy but my experience was awesome we came in on the restaurantcom certificate and had the best dinner so far in phoenix
1,little place typical french i ordered the beef bourguignon which is a first  it was delicious and well worth it  desert try the creme bolle yummythe service was also excellent the atmosphere intimate i would definitely go there again
1,lived in france for two years i found this to be the most authentic food in phoenix they were very accommodating to special requests the ambiance was beautiful and the restaurant was set in a little "pocket of paradise" meaning one might not know that it was so close to 24th st and not see it on a drive by
1,placevery friendly service everyone was so nice this place is very clean and it has a nice casual atmospherethe rolls are outstandingwe ordered the lobster bisque scallops and coq au vin everything was excellent the salads with the entrees were great as well wish we had time for dessert but we unfortunately had a prior engagementwe will definitely return
1,hate to admit it (because i usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but i love postino  it used to be an old post office thus the name  it is now a wine bar that serves "light fare"  there are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the valley -- very california  one of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open  little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices  the bathrooms are lovely clean and lit by candles  the salads are my favorite in phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world   come early get your table and enjoy
1,heard so much about postino that i wasn't sure it would live up to the hype happily it did the atmosphere the food and the wine all measure up at postino the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and campbellpostino is upscale but not pretentious the bruschetta really is out of this world but the salads are incredible too went there for lunch on a friday and loved the diversity of the crowd i also liked it that the noise level was reasonable even when the place was packed
1,of my favorite places in phoenix that i don't frequent nearly enough  great selection of wines by the glass  the atmosphere is sexy industrial pseudo-warehouse i-don't-think-i'm-in-phoenix type lounge  i think on tuesdays they have a live dj in the mix  it's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis  the autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazingupdate - great service just recently  a bit of a wait but forgot about it because of the great servers - michelle i think was one of them  just had a tobin syrah that was incredible
1,love this place  it's a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino  be sure to order the bruschettai especially love the figs and prosciutto
1,at the sw corner of 40th st and campbell  this entire corner is now owned by an enterprising young couple who ingeniously converted the old post office to a wine bar featuring fresh aperitifs and lite gourmet pizza  they did such a fab job on the remodel they were written up in architects digest some 8 years ago (or more) when they opened  it's become something of a low key meeting hub with "great date" written all over the place  any given night of the week you will find this place a' buzz  so plan on a wait unless it's early in the evening or very early in the week - like monday  open for lunch and open late; again with some candied confections that could make a girl on a diet cry  look cute because this is where the beautiful people hang out in phoenix sans attitude  moderately priced
1,love this place  i just recently moved to san francisco from arizona but i already made sure to visit it on my first trip back  i have never brought someone there and had them not like it the atmosphere is great - small and cozy and very warmly decorated for a former post office  the wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar   service is typically good unless they are super busy (friday and saturday)in addition to the wine choices the bruschetta is awesome  my favorite is the red pepper goat cheese but i've also heard very good things about the proscuittomascarponefig one  you order a sampler of four different types at a time - and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat optionsthe only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the se valley - it is a far drive from chandler or gilbert to the arcadia neighborhood in phoenix  here's a tip though: when you get there don't wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby
1,totally heart this place the food is great - for a wine bar you can actually eat dinner and leave not feeling like you filled up on cheese and olives the whole time plus the wait staff is great  you will have to wait on a saturdayfriday night - but who is in a  rush then anyway it reminds me of a neighborhood place in san frana must-go in phoenix
1,of my favorite spots in phx i make a trip almost every time i'm in town  the food selection is limited but good there's an admirable wine selection but the atmosphere is unlike anything else in phx  i highly recommend
1,on my sweltering trip to phoenix i visited this place  my good friend's brother is one of the bartenders (sam) so we had to check it out sat at the bar for a late afternoon lunch  started off with a glass of champagne just because i was on vacation and i could :)   we also had some champagne mixers they were making specially that day that were really nicei had some trouble deciding what to eat since the menu all looks so tasty but i went with the bruchetta  i mean come on you get to choose 4 toppings how could i not  i even had a hard time choosing only 4  i had the apple with brie and fig spread (my favorite) roasted red pepper with goat cheese (very good) prosciutto with figs and marscapone (wow) and salami with pesto (great)  all of this for $12 and huge  four heaping pieces of bread cut into four pieces each  my friend also got the roasted artichoke one which was just as delicious  three glasses of champagne and more bruschetta than i could possibly eat i was extremely satisfied  i've been actually thinking latelywhere can i get this delicious food in la
1,is my fav place in az to go i visit about 3-4 times a year and i usually visit postinola grande orange about 3 times minimum when i am therethis is the hotness: everyday from 11am-3pm every kind of wine is $5glasshello liquid lunchwell goodbye liquid lunch because you'll want to eat everything on the menu from the bruschetta to start (you cannot go there and not order the bruschetta) - i usually get: ricotta & dates & pistachios brie & apples mascarpone & prosciutto artichoke as for the main course for lunch the salads are great and the paninis are f-in sweet as wellthe wine list is always good changing a little here and there afterwards go next store to la grande orange grocery and pick up some goods to go i almost forgot - it's called postino bc they converted the old arcadia post office into a restaurant it's got an indooroutdoor feel so you don't have to sit outside in order to feel like you've got a little breeze and sunshine there are also loungeycouch areas to sit and eatdrink if you want too instead of the traditional table & chairswhen visiting az don't miss this spot (there is a lot of italian in az and this place gets lunch right)
1,it love it love itwhether you're looking for a fantastic bottle to take home or you want to munch on cheese and crackers while you drink and converse my wine cellar has you covered  the retail portion of the restaurant is really excellent the walls lined with a huge selection of reds and whites  if you're intimidated by the selection or are a beginning wino the restaurant offers "wine education" courses  my fiance and i attended a weekly "wine 101" course a couple of years back  each week we sampled a different genre of wine including reds whites dessert wines and champagnes  also each week included a guest speaker usually a sales rep for a wine maker  lots of fun and i learned a huge amount of information
1,love lucy's and i do great selection of wines yummy snacks and "bar pies" - really where else can you go for a $100 wine and pizza i say that a bit sarcastically - as i always get a bit ahead of myself and pick out a great wine because really life is to short to drink bad wine  my husband rolls his eyes when i suggest lucy's cause i am not a cheap date there but he likes it too he even threw a surprise bday party for me there recently - and it was all perfect the back patio is super when the weather is nice and they have cozy couches inside or a table if you prefer check it out it's fun
1,an awesome relaxed feeling when entering seating on comfy couches and chairs very clean-has lucille ball stuff all round fall tree and very cute decor- that did it- oh and the wine too   bruschetta (traditional) is perfect w drink loved it
1,you like wine and awesome food - you must try my wine cellar they have an awesome selection of vino and an amazing menu to boot the staff and owners are wonderful people and make it a delight to come here my food favorites on the menu are the pizzas a culinary masterpiece and my favorite wine is the onehope chardonnay - not only is it inexpensive and delish - but 50% of profits are donated to breast cancer charitiesbottom line amazing and affordable food + yummy wine + great people  a good time :-)
1,mwc went for an after dinner drink for my sisters birthday we were greeted by the owner with a friendly smile katie was our server she was very knowledgeable i told her i wanted a cab and she brought me a lil piece of heaven my sisters and i shared the cheese platter and it was more than enough for the 3 of us the entire staff was super friendly i will be returning to mwc for sure whether it's for date nite or girls nite i can't wait to go back thanks again katie you were amazing
1,pretty much the perfect place for date night first dates thousandth dates last date whatever amazing patio great music(cheers to whoever auditions these people or trusts their mixed tape) great wine selection and awesome food i love their bruschetta's  the service is speedy and low key you don't have to worry about someone hovering but when you need that next glass they are there with a suggestion professional and knowledgeable the owners are great i think every time i have been there(a lot) one of them has stopped by to say hi and make sure everything was great i know this place has just transferred ownership and man they are doing everything right it was good when i first started going and now it is great totally recommend to anyone looking to take a date to a classy place that is reasonably priced where you can make it a long night if things are going well and a short night if she sucks
1,the ambiance to the staff to the wine list this place has got it figured out  i love wine but i usually feel like i'm being tested when i go into wine bars  this place is so unpretentious it's a breath of fresh air  if you don't know exactly what to ask for the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past what flavor profiles you prefer and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the headthey just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as wellyou have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best i've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon)to top it off this place even offers wine 101 classes grape varietal classes and even a book club  i think you get it by now: this place rules
1,place has everything for the perfect date they had a guy singing called big white cloud  lol he was great the service was perfect  the outdoor heaters are magical i will be back 
1,this place up to five stars since i have been here a couple more times and both times it was a great night  this place has an awesome vibe to it great food and wine and good servicethe pizza is very tasty and filling the bruschetta options are all amazing i also tried the antipasto plate and was happy to see it came with a little salad that helped to balance out the saltiness of the meats the cheese and olives that it came with were a great accompaniment to the wine we were drinking that night this place is awesome because their bottle prices are extremely reasonable in price and they have some diverse options the comfy couches and relaxed atmosphere make it a great place to just hang out with friends for hours  the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and they are great at recommending new wines  i asked about a wine that i had once but haven't been able to find anywhere else and they actually ordered a case of it for me  just a really great place
1,love coming here for an after work drink in a relaxing environment they have a decent wine selection with a nice happy hour menu offering some really tasty treats i love the bruschetta particularly the brie apple and caramelized onions - deliciousthe staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive i sit on the patio almost every time and love it they have lights strung across the patio and it gives a great ambiance in the evening i've been on a saturday night before and they had live entertainment - just a guy and his guitar - and it was the perfect touch to the already amazing atmospherei also attended a networking event here for women in my industry and they handled it perfectly the staff was spot on offered perfect little bites and made it a very enjoyable eventi really like how laid back and relaxed the environment is and am so happy it's so close to work that i can make it a regular spot to unwind
1,have my friend tigearnan to thank for first introducing me to pesto's  who knew it even existed with it's unassuming stripmall facade   i was pleasantly surprised to meet antonio a superb bartender who makes you feel as if he invited you to his house for dinner and cocktails with 40 or so of his closest friends  he mixes a mean martini and helps you make the best drink and eat choices to fit your moodthe lighting is right the food fresh and tasty and the staff bring it all together for a delightful evening of socializing and or just eating  i'm crazy for their house pesto pizza and  fabulous greek salad  all this for a great priceit's a jewel in the east valley you have to check it out
1,remember when this place was nothing more than a hole in the wall :) i went here a couple of months ago and wow what a change the food is still delicious as ever but they have really upgraded the place and it is a really nice restaraunt now a great place to go for a first date
1,only got to this place once while i was in arizona and really intended to go back--maybe next trip  they had really wonderful spaghetti with white clam sauce an item i often try but rarely find as good as my home place in california--san fillipo's in la mesa  my daughter got the calzones which she had had here before and knew they were good  i had a taste and while that is an item i never order they were delicious  the atmosphere here was very nice also and i was really glad we had chosen it  it's one i wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others
1,my first review wasnt the best but since they've remodeled the place i love itgreat neighborhood spot to go for a drink and a bite to eat their cheese plate appetizer is delicious and the pesto pizza is my favorite
1,- where have you been all my life  it was my pick saturday night for dinner only to find out my hubby had been for lunch a couple years ago  boy was he surprised  who knew such a cute winepizzapasta place was inside  the decor is gorgeous - and i loved the beaded curtain and high top tables  as for food - i had the best calzone (the pesto) i've ever had  it wasn't too cheesy and the sauce on top was perfect  we also loved pesto's take on the caprese with greens added  there were lots of options for wine too    the hubby tried the pepperoni pizza and said it was "okay" but he's picky when it comes to pizzagranted we did go early but there were too many kids for my liking  if you're looking for a more "adult" environment i'd suggest sitting in the bar area  as we were leaving they were setting up some live music  we'll definitely be back
1,going to see eat pray love of course there was nothing i was craving more than authentic italian food i've been here before for lunch and dinner so pestos was the first place that popped into my head this place apparently has been around for years and i'm not surprised-their food is amazing i ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for) mozzarella sticks with marinara olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it) and of course a cannoli for dessert the linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams the mozzarella sticks were so-so nothing special about them that i was thinking i should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms insteadthese i know are worth itoh well next time the olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-i love olives they come with sesame bread which i'm not really a fan of but i was craving carbs so i smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast now i have never had a cannoli as delicious as the ones i've gotten from pesto's ever these are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing from the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh crispy shell your mouth will thank you everyone that works here is absolutely amazing it's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do i've never had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during seton's lunch hour) their service has always been top-notch i highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli )
1,don't get out to chandler much but a friend's bridal shower ended up being held here from the food to the service everything could not have gone smoother i heard they had recently remodeled the place wellbravo everything is tastefully decorated looks like a great place to get your happy hour on there was a beaded curtain that sort of separates the bar area from the dining area but it's a metallic bead curtain so not at all hippie-like i can't believe a place like this is inside a strip mall with a safewaythe theme of the shower was wine and cocktails the bartender--the owner's daughter--was super hospitable and personable for our party she demonstrated how to make four different cocktails and the owner even went to the trouble of printing out the cocktail recipes on specially decorated paper the owner is a lovely woman with a lovely personality the owner is actually good friend's with the bride's mom so i don't know if the restaurant would do that for any party but judging by how nice she was i'm sure they would do something if asked and offered reasonable payment and everyone was raving about the cocktails which were truly very good my favorite was a chocolate martini the bartender was skilled at taste as well as presentation for the food we had a yummy cheese plate which included a parmesan cheese with honey for dipping a truffle flavored cheese and another cheese that came with a pesto dip we also had some scrumptious stuffed mushrooms and for pizza we went with the pesto and mediterranean (sun dried tomatoes chicken and feta cheese) the pizzas were thin crust and piping hot and the cheese in my opinion was melted to the right consistency it took all my power not to shove down more pieces when not everybody had gotten some yet i was happy with the food and level of service i would definitely recommend to anyone i only wished i lived closer so i could visit pesto's on a week day
1,most unexpected gem if you are a wine drinker fabulous flights great selection i can't say much more other than awesome
1,a pleasant surprise this place was  great wine list terrific food and a totally awesome contemporary decor the ambiance and lighting were perfect and the space created a very relaxed modern vibe which was not at all what i was expecting from the outside it's in a strip mall in a fry's lot and looks from the outside like an average mom and pop pizza joint but it's totally chic and cool inside  my husband and i are pretty picky about our italian food and we liked everything that we ordered i especially liked the eggplant parmesan sub i had it was one of the best i've ever had the wine flights are really great you can choose 4 of your own picks or go with one of their themes the pours are generous you get what equals at least 2 full glasses when you order a flight we will definitely be going back
1,was in town for a quick trip and needed a place to grab a late dinner  from the yelp description i only knew it was a pizza place with good reviews - i didn't realize the atmosphere was so chill and modern  pesto's is not just a little hole in the wall with white walls and pizza sauce stains by the floorboards  instead it's a very nice spot to take a date or to just belly up to the bar solo (as i did)service was friendly and fast and a good selection of alcohol (especially liquor) is on handgreat atmosphere friendly service and delicious calzone drenched in sauce and absolutely delicious

1,mother is a member here and she wanted to come for a family dinner over the holidays  they have completely remodeled this country club which was long overdue and it is so gorgeous now   it is hard to put into words the transformation this place has undergone  it does not look anything like it used to except for maybe the golf course and the parking lot  our server was young and was probably used to going through the motions of serving tables but we were there to enjoy ourselves and have drinks and conversation when we clued him into our intentions he was fine with that and very accommodating  there was one minor incident where he spilled my cosmopolitan on my sisters fiance but he handled it like a champ:)  we actually felt really bad for him because we know that is a servers worst nightmare he was lucky that he did that to our table and not another club member somehow i don't think they would have been as nice as we were  our food was very good and our server was a great guy too  we had a great time at the arizona country club
1,service delicious food and an absolutely stunning view this would be a great place to get married
1,notch golf country club the course is well maintained year round the staff is friendly and helpful they put on classy family friendly events and all the facilities are kept clean and in working condition saturday morning bingo is surprisingly entertaining especially when you win magnums of napa valley wine ;)
1,of the great old school phoenix courses left tough as nails if you're not straight down the middle from the tips azcc will challenge all skill levels great food in the bar excellent training facilities top notch all the way
1,love the fact that you can play golf in phoenix and not have to worry about hitting out of the desert the tree lined fairways remind me of playing in the midwest which is nice in this part of the state
1,place is a really off the wall vegas experience an authentic german gasthaus just off las vegas blvd  full bar and great beer on tap - at great prices  the club is private but you are allowed a limited number of visits without joining  there is usually a dinner on saturday nights (check the website for details)  the quality of the meals prepared by the members is good and again the pricing is reasonable  non-members can enjoy a meal also  just call the club by thursday to make a reservation  absolutely one of my favorite places to have a beer in las vegas  surreal atmosphere warm and friendly people (almost none of them are german ;))) and delicious german beer on tapthe club itself (known as the gascon)  is pretty neat too  they have a couple boozy golf tournaments a year which are a lot of fun and also do a fantastic job hosting the oktoberfest in dt las vegas  annual membership is like $35  i carry my card in my wallet  the gascon is making a push to increase the headcount of its younger members (hold your national socialist youth movement jokes please ;)))  there's talk of using the space on the off nights as a music venue and also of hosting viewing parties for both the us and germany games at the 2014 world cup  i'll be there
1,club is great fun nights good bar good food they are open tuesday for jazz night friday for card night saturday dinner and dancing and one sunday a week for fruschoppen or brunch  please check out the website of gascon if you need info
1,years of driving by this place at not going in (it is a club*) we finally had the chance during a rummage sale oh my god it is cute inside i know a german restaurant in town that could use the charm of this placeit has a full bar (with german beer -of course) and kitchen (kitchen is usually only used for their tuesday night vintage vegas jazz evenings saturday dinners and the once a month sunday brunch  they said the club is also available for special event rentals most of the members are above the age of 50 (but i was told they have been getting a small influx of younger members recently)  best to check their website for hours of operation but they are open tuesday evenings for jazz  (sometimes) on thursday evenings friday and saturday afternoon and evenings and the once a month sunday brunch  the bar prices are cheap it is an all ages club so you can bring your children there (just not in the bar section)  this is a "private club" but they said guests can come three times to experience it before signing up oh the dues if you do want to join it costs $3 a month  ($35 the first year) and $2 a month for following years ($25 for renewal years) what a bargain  yes i ended signing my wife and i up we love it so much
1,leatherneck club is totally cool my boy mo turned me on to this place as he and his vet buddies from operation desert storm used to go there and swap tales with the oldtimers it is practically a museum to the usmc with all sorts of insignia signage pictures and even war souvenirs like captured kalishnikov rifles grenades and flags from wwii and vietnam plus after drinking there and staggering out into the night you feel like you are in singapore or hanoi what with the neon lights asian signage and massage parlors everywhere if you are a marine you are to report there immediately or drop and give me twenty hoo -ra
1,my god  where do i begin  it was love at first sight  at once when i first started frequenting the place i honestly was a little leery of dining there  my buddy told me to order the pepper burger  holy hell  freaking amazing  the food there is to die for  ill be across town & drive over for taco tues or a green chili burger  the drinks are fabulous & everyone is so friendlyall the military memorabilia is really cool & the bunker out back is sweet  thank you for your service & the great chow 
1,this place if you're a marine who finds yourself in vegas definitely check this place out the crew of the leatherneck club hosted our squadron for a party during one of our nellis training dets
1,you are a marine and you come to las vegas you owe it to yourself to stop in and check out the leatherneck club  it is a bargrill that is part museum part marine corps party house  beer is super cheap at about $200 for domestics and the food is priced as well  one of the best burgers i have had in vegas
1,belong to a marine corps league detachment and one of the old timers told me about this joint what better place to put a marine bar than smack dab in the middle of chinatown and right next to an asian massage parlor no less i can neither confirm nor deny that the massages at the aforementioned establishment have a happy ending but i can tell you that if you are a marine or a devil doc checking out this place is a must if you are the child or grandchild of a marine or devil doc or even a new girlfriend of one bringing your vet here during your next vegas trip is a mustthey didn't lie when they said they have some of the coldest beer in town they carry both import and domestic but sadly no dos xx's no drink is over $5 and they pour pretty strong they also have a few beers on tap to include a hefenweizen deb was our bartender and her husband spider cooks in the galley and they have lunch specials and friday night dinners too from what i hear spider cooks a mean meal and even does catering for the events that go on at their hall which is available to rent for special eventsthey are home to the marine corps riders motorcycle club as well inside their hall they have memorabilia from wwi all the way up to oifoef ranging from uniforms to campaign commemorative k-bars and even enemy articles as well i am sure they'd take any kind of donations if you have them to add to their museum i noticed they didn't have much air wing stuff so i donated my squadron patch (hmh-465) to them if you want gear to take home they have a small px and sell challenge coins and t-shirts from their mcl detachment and a few basic usmc veterans covers toothe last bit of info i can pass on is that its a little hard to find cause its in the middle of the arville shoppingtown square ant can't easily be seen from the street just look for the big yellow massage sign with red lettering on the right hand side you can't miss it  and you won't want to either its just like being in an e-club on base and i'd imagine just like the snco or o clubs too they have a few regulars there and a retired colonel whose a member there made us feel right at home from the moment we walked in the doo and even bought me and my compadre also a marine a couple of shots if you are reading this col czech (tom) thanks for your hospitality  like the say once a marine always a marine semper fi

1,don't come here for the food or because it's a nice and trendy place i come here because i'm a us marine even the good drinks are cheap and i'm surrounded by my brothers very simple
1,you're a devil dog and visiting las vegas get off the strip and visit the leatherneck club  the moment you park your vehicle get out and observe the sign "marine corps league leatherneck club" you will feel right at home  as you enter you will observe the museum with artifacts dating back to world war i (all donated from marines and their family members)  you never know who you will run into while there  i was fortunate to be there the same time as ssgt tim chambers aka "the saluting marine" and a korean war veteran  what an inspiration they were  to the marines who manage leatherneck club thank you with all my heart  you all welcomed my family and i with open arms  semper fi

1,place to see live music  good beer cool staff chill crowd  plenty of stuff to do in the area too  there is free parking on the streets so don't pay for the lot
1,that this place never closes one of the best spots in charlotte to see live music
1,husband and i love this place it's intimate hip and cool great beer great staff great vibe and great line ups i can't say enough about this place (and this is coming from a girl who has been entrenched in the san francisco and austin music scene)
1,music scene in charlotte can be a little sparse  i imagine a lot of acts just don't want to roll through the queen city for whatever reason  thank goodness for the neighborhood theater then not only for being a great venue for a fan but for being the type of venue that i think a lot of bands would really enjoy playingthe main performance space is airy and well ventilated especially when they've got that monster ceiling fan running  where did they find that thing  on the death stari also like that they've got seating in addition to the standing-only floor space  i sat through three bands in a row a few weeks ago comfy as i could be in my padded seat  might make me sound geriatric but i appreciated taking a load offi was all the more comfortable as a result of the excellent beer selection at the concession  they've got a top notch bunch of brews including sierra nevada bell's and sweetwater  nice job on thatto top it all the acoustics are great and it's pretty conveniently locatedneighborhood theater is the type of place charlotte cannot afford to be without and i'm looking forward to many more shows there
1,of my top two favorite places to watch live music  in charlotte (double door inn is my other)  located in noda this place has a great sound system with no bad seat in the house  go when the doors open to reserve a seat then go grab a cocktail and explore noda (the dog bar and cabo fish taco are two other favorites in the area)  prefer to stand  plenty of room for that up front so you can be up close and personaland dance  neighborhood theatre also upgraded their bar area- now serving all kinds of beers licquor etc  cheerssee you at a show
1,attended the neighborhood theatre wants to say congratulations to the the latin american coalition - charlotte nc for selling out the event and it being only their 2nd year doing the event the vendors were great the people were fully participative and everyone had a great time bcbs usairways cricket etc had great giveaways i'll be back next year the venue was a pretty good size nice size music hall for concerts plays and festivals check out their production line up and see for yourself i'm sure you all will be pleased i was and will definitely be back for more fun
1,must reiterate what an amazing place this is and how it is absolutely a staple not only to the noda area but the entire live music seen in charlotte  i apologize for my quick review before but most of my write ups are about food so i was just straight to the pointsooooo much history here and more to be made  many bluegrass legends such as doc waston del mccourey and acoustic syndicate  other genre's such as little feet rusted root and even members of crosby sills and nash have graced these doors  too many too mention   there are many free shows quite often and its one of the biggest venues where you can still feel that intimate vibe from your favorite artists imo  1000ish capacity i'd sayfirst of all:don't park in their parking lot unless your in a hurry there are plenty of free spots up and down the sidestreets of the areaas soon as you walk up and see the marque you know the place is legit  once you walk in the can see the side stage if open and a bar to your left always filled with friendly faces  there are plenty of good beers on tap($4 for a stone ipa being my favorite) at this cash only barfor most larger shows this side stage i speak of is rarely noticed and the dance floor for it is open for you to watch the main stage in the next room over  that is where the fun is  there is normally a dance floor open up front with seating behind it but when "softer" more singer songwriter type shows happen they pull out the seats for all  another option is the balcony upstairs(which is full of seats) is normally a great place to be because many that don't know the theater well don't know about it although it can get a little hot up there  the vip section may be worth it to you as having a waitress is nice but you'll pay a little more for the ticketthe place is nice but the talent they pull is amazing rarely if ever have i heard anything not at least listenable and except for a couple free acts everything i've seen there has sounded great  this place normally has something going on all the time and coincides with the gallery crawls too  this is a piece of charlotte that has to be witnessed read the calendar if you don't see anything you recognize read some reviews of the bands i have a feeling there is something there for almost everybody  at least go buy and check out the free arts market when it happenshope to see ya there i'll probably be the guy with a beer in his hand standing front row
1,place to see any show  large venue they use curtains to section it off for smaller shows but the place is huge  in the main stage area there is the biggest fan i've ever seen possibly bigger than most helicopter blades and it churns out hurricane like wind that will literally blow you off your feet  there is a huge mushroom statue right inside the entrance that appropriately makes you feel like you are falling down the rabbit hole which side of the mushroom did you eat they have $3 pbrs on draft which is a nice deal  the bathrooms are by no means high-class but they do have awesome high-tech eco-friendly hand dryers that remind me the old school operation game don't hit the side or you lose  ps- they sell earplugs here if you forget to bring your own  but if you value your hearing i would recommend having a pair stashed in your back pocket
1,place is dramatically better inside since they fixed it up the once dinky bar counter is now a full on bar with plenty of seating and selection various types or art adorns the wall though it's a little dark to fully appreciate some of it the lighting is appropriate for everything else thoughthey didn't really change the stage area there is still a giant stage with tons of space in front of it and plenty of dancing and sitting room there is one new thing in the stage room you can access a section of the bar now which is awesomethe is one let down i'm not sure if they are fixing it up or it's just been closed but you can no longer get up on the balcony which used to be one of my favorite places to relax hopefully they have it open again but all and all i love what they did with the place
1,great legion post excellent reasonable food very congenial members always make you feel welcome always a pleasure to come here the menu is great there is music special events and terrific cocktail prices a top notch american legion posttheir chef is terrific can't beat the steak sandwich the reuben the fries the soups for lunch in fact i have never had a bad meal here it may not be haute cuisine but the friendliness the reasonable prices and the very nice patio by the way make this an a1 post
1,top notch american legion post
1,am writing this review on behalf of my mother because she is not a yelper here are her comments: on our recent visit to scottsdale my husband and i visited to post 44 the patrons and bartenders were super friendly and made us east coasters feel welcome i would recommend both young and old visiting this post the drinks are cheap and there is gambling it's a good place to go to get a drink and make some friends it's not called the "best damn post in the west" for nothing
1,security of this community always takes great care of us 247 patrolling our streets the actual community center is located right next to the school that's how you know even our kids are safe and when you need help they come right away this entire neighborhood is peaceful and the people here are friendly i love that there are trails that run in-between and all through out this neighborhood and there's long roads instead of street patches that way when the day comes for me to finally wake up early enough i can actually jog if i'd want to live anywhere in summerlin it would be right here in this neighborhood it's right in the heart of everything good in summerlin
1,the neighborhood everyone is friendly to me :d
1,clean and well kept community association
1,a beautiful course  lucky to get to play here with a great member and a couple of other friends  the course was absolutely beautiful and in perfect condition  dan was a great forecaddy as well  staff was courteous and i hope to play again  you can't go wrong here and i would rate it right up there with shadow creek
1,have been a student of the true buddha school most of my life the school is global with the main headquarters in redmond washington i recently moved to charlotte and was so pleased there was a temple here the people here are some of the nicest i've met the services are all mostly conducted in chinese and the attendees are also mostly chinese so it can be very disconcerting for non-chinese speakers don't be intimidated culturally there are differences but everyone is good people :) on a day-to-day basis the english is limited but we definitely have quite a few english speakers dotted within if you have questions or want to learn more please feel free to call or stop by and try and make an appointment with an english speaker we are usually there on sundays regular weekly service (usually group cultivation + meditation) is from 11-1 you can feel free to come by and observe and we can try and answer any questions you have before or afterwards and you would be more than welcome to stay for lunchthere are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to english printed words only get you so far the best thing to do is to track down an english-speaker and ask everything you've ever wanted to ask there are no stupid questions only "teachers" who may not know the best answer :)currently and at least through the end of the year (2014) we have a dharma class being taught in english from 1:30 to 3 it gets into some of the nitty gritty of buddhism so if you are a beginner i'd recommend talking to someone before jumping into class either way anyone and everyone is welcometbs is open to everyone chinese or not and of any religious backgroundour spiritual leader is living buddha lian sheng our dharma and our practice encompasses all buddhist schools of mahayana hinayana and mostly vajrayana while other temples and societies may practice differently we all believe in the same basic precepts of the four noble truths and the eightfold path
1,you have a interest in buddhism and don't know anyone who is buddhist or just want to experience this first hand this is the most welcoming group of people you will ever meet they are willing to explain the buddhist practice to you one on one or within a group there are meetings that take place throughout the valley so if this is to far to go to call them they will help you get teamed up with someone in your neighborhood which is nice they also have a website that explains the practice as well but i must say you have to experience this first hand hearing the discussion and interacting with someone first hand is the best way to truly understand this practice
1,is the most welcoming and diverse religious group i've found in las vegas  i use the term "religious" loosely because many including myself would argue that buddhism is more of a philosophy for life and well being  much of buddhism does not fall under the general "religion" rules  no prosthelytizing no supernatural beliefs or dogma and no belief in a "heaven and hell" or all-knowing higher powerthe sgi-usa buddhist center focuses on a particular brand of buddhism known as soka-gakkai which is the most established and followed form of buddhism in the united states  i was told that the president of the global organization donated some of his personal money to cover much of the costs of construction because he felt the las vegas area was a crucial place to have a presencei went to the community center a few months back to check it all out  luckily i got to see one of the monthly valley-wide meetings that everyone attends  you're likely to hear a lot of chanting perhaps a video from an sgi presidential address in japan and lots of people talking about how buddhism has improved their lives  what struck me most is the diversity  you'll find people from all ages races and walks of life  no formal dress code  just come as you arethere are plenty of volunteers who are there to explain sgi buddhism  to newcomers  much of the day-to-day and weekly experiences involve attending smaller meetings with people in your neighborhood often hosted at a member's home  i haven't been back much since i'm still exploring other forms of buddhism  but those who are interested will find this as an excellent starting point
1,place ultimately probably not for me but everyone i met was super friendly and helpful they all took a lot of time to help me out thanks marco
1,out here from denver for a bit i decided to check out the vegas chapter well first the doors were locked :( i walk around and run into larry hes in the back pulling weeds awesome we introduce ourselves and he opens the doors for me i tell him im from the denver chapter and he welcomes me with open arms immediately i felt like ive been attending this one forever its been open about a year and a half it was built with the environment in mind and is very green the bookstore was closed but i peered in and although this one is smaller it still has a lot of space they used it well they have a office for your use and a main room to chant and a over flow room then 2 other rooms that double as conference rooms and have smaller gohonzon's in them as well we talked for a while and gave me some names of the people whos district ill be in and he wondered back outside to finish landscaping while i chanted for a bit i said my goodbyes and went about my way until sunday i even found out the history about how this buddhist center was built and will be the basis for new sgi centers
1,you for this post i will be moving to las vegas and it is nice to know where the temple is  when i get there i know where to go so i can put my gohonzon up im am so looking forward to this move again thank you
1,for an amazing trip with my fellow buddhists it's going to be an amazing time i just love love this place and philosophy
1,second home filled with my second family i became a member september '13 and have completely changed my life for the better this is the place to be on wednesday and saturdays for buddhism 101 it is a very clean facility i wish the bookstore was bigger the people inside are the realist and kindest people you will ever come across
1,beautiful and nice temple it is small but good for practicing buddhism i like it here it is affiliated with fo guan shan i like it here i came here for the first time when i visited vegas and i was looking for a buddhist temple i ended up joining their sunday service and i actually had a very good time i am buddhist regardless what the world is i like buddhism so this is my faith and religion i believe jesus is a buddha or a boddhistiva or a ruler of one of the thirty three heaven he can't be the one that satan god send to earth to teach people good things i know some buddhist believe it but i remember my original buddhist teaching and also why would doctor sun yat sun believe in jesus
1,the monthly food fairs everyone is very friendly and ready to explain everything
1,is actually for the thai street food thing that they have every month all the food was amazing and for the price it was well worth itpad thai - for 5 dollars you can have possibly some of the best pad thai in vegasfish ball and beef noodle soup - same price 5 bucks amazing soup
1,been meaning to try their monthly fundraiser for a while so glad i finally did super cheap and delish food prepared mostly to order by cute little thai grandmas huge portion of mango sticky rice for $6 - everything else maxed out at $5 we tried chicken pad thai pork and chicken satay for $1skewer and papaya salad which my friend says was the best he's ever had we got a bunch of asstd snacks mostly coconutty things for $1-$2 they had flower like things just like hawaii style chinese pretzels and steamed cakes like filipino poto can't wait to go back next month 519 btw cash only of course
1,was amazingly surprised to see my childhood monk's monastery on yelpi grew up being raised buddhist so i went to numerous monasteries in the las vegas area this is by far the best buddhist temple in las vegas the decor is beautiful inside and it is very spacious so you aren't crammed next to each other when you meditate arjahn chaiya the lead monk is extremely helpful when you want to learn about the buddhist religion; he does not come off strong like most religious practitioners which is a big plus he is very respectful of other religions and beliefsalthough i do not practice buddhism any more i still come to pay my respects to arjahn chaiya but i also come for the monthly food fair that is popularly reviewed on yelp some of the food is good but not spectacular; however the items that are there every month that are amazing are the moo yahng (pork skewers) and guay tiew nam (rice noodle soup) all in all its a nice spacious and beautiful monastery to practice buddhism and it is a delicious cultural find
1,they are soooo friendly too :))))
1,good and be good; not to do any evil to cultivate good to purify one's mind- this is the teaching of the buddhas" -cmm websitechaiya meditation monastery hosts a monthly food fair that many attend for the inexpensive tasty thai food with proceeds going towards paying the monastery's mortgage  i've been to the food fair several times but never really looked around the monastery grounds until this month  visitors are welcome to cross the colorful bridge and explore the outdoor meditation area that is obviously well-tended to by the monks and nuns who reside at the monastery  at the time i walked through it was only myself and one of the monks was there doing a little gardening  it's not a very large area but it does have several beautiful buddhist statues a pavilion a golden tower and sidewalks that visitors can walk along to see this intimate place of worship  according to the website the monastery offers daily meditation classes that are open to the public one from 9:00am-10:00am and another from 5:00-6:00pm  for more info go to wwwchaiyacmmorgi'm definitely not an expert on buddhism but from what i've seen of the monastery it's obvious that the goal of providing a tranquil space for meditation and some peace for those of any religion (or no religion at all) has been met by chaiya
1,is an amazing placethe instructors are fantastic  dominika melissa and lisa teach from the heartwith great precisionpassionand years of experience  kinesphere rocks
1,cannot say enough wonderful things about kinesphere and owner dominika she recently lead a private class for my monthly women's group kindly opening the studio late to us and allowing our group to bring in refreshmentsupon walking in the door to see a welcome note to my group on their lobby chalkboard we immediately left the outside world behind us the studio is gorgeous clean comfortable and peaceful dominika instructed us on "relax and release" techniques expertly demonstrating the use of foam rollers and other equipment for stress relieving stretchesdominika welcomed our questions during the demonstration and easily managed to correct and assist the entire group that evening so that we each had a great (and valuable) experience i have gotten great feedback from all of our attendees on our visit the staff at kinesphere have their priorities straight they made each of us (with varying degrees of experience and different fitness levels) comfortable i will definitely be returning to kinesphere and highly recommend it
1,absolutely loved "hello tai chi goodbye stress"  what an awesome relaxing  dvd i am new to tai chi and qi gong and this dvd was very easy for me to follow my entire body was comfortable and i felt reduced stress  i was refreshed and energized after the practice
1,chi with kim kubsch is so beneficial to my health plus relaxing for my mind and body as mayo clinic and harvard medical report "tai chi is more effective and has fewer dangers or side effects than almost any other form of exercise" kim's two easy and gentle tai chi dvd's are excellent to use at home or on vacation to ensure my balance and coordination stay strong everyday - ka arizona

1,much fun here  we are learning excellent skills but we are always having a good laugh and enjoying the time  i spend all day working in front of a computer so my body gets very stiff  i leave the dojo feeling completely stretched out and my body feels better all week  i'm so glad i found this place and i recommend it to anyone who has any interest in aikido tai chi or simply needs a new fun way to get out of a seated position
1,is an excellent instructor  he's very patient and obviously knowledgeable about what he teaches  besides techniques he also has a vast store of knowledge based on experience that makes his classes truly comprehensive and applicable to the real world  and on top of all that he's a great guy who makes training fun
1,new dojo is great they thought a lot about the mat and it feels good on the feet and it's almost enjoyable to fall definitely one of the best in town if not the bestangus teaches non-traditional aikido and tai chi and his style of teaching is very flexible and fun it's a good way to de-stress after work and we're definitely learning valuable martial arts everyone who goes to class are also very nice people
1,place is like a little italian grocery and a prepared foods shop  they have the best fresh pasta (i love how it takes like 2 minutes to cook)- they have a bunch of different kinds of ravioli spaghetti and other classic italian dishes  if you want to try something a little different the sweet potato ravioli is awesome  i also highly reccomend their sauces and breads  this place also has a pretty decent wine selction  this is the perfect to stop and pick-up something that you can prepare at home in minutes
1,the difference with the fresh pasta from this placeyes you can buy "fresh" pasta in the grocery store but don't it ain't so freshthe lobster and crab ravioli was outstanding when combined with my own recipe for vodka sauce i added shrimp and viola my guests were impressed i love it because although i enjoy cookingravioli is last on my list to whip up in the kitcheni've also purchased the cavatelli in the past and was fantastic along with my simple broccoli and garlic saucebased on the taste and freshness of the  pasta i give five stars  skip the chicken dishes in imoalso love the wine selectionoh and they have cannolis
1,place is amazing i lived in rome italy for 6 months and this is as close as it comes in charlotte they have make to order fresh pasta that is fabulous great rosemary focaccia over 15 different types of ravioli lots of italian wine and groceries as well yum
1,the amazing array of italian imported oils pastas cheeses wines canned and jarred veggies and such more expensive than your average high-end grocery store yeahdoes it cost more to buy their made-in-house spaghettini or ravioli than ht's failed attempts of coursebut who cares everyone that works here is awesome you can taste almost anything in the cold case before purchasing open kitchen in the back so you can watch if you tire of shoppingit's an impressive little store that deserves the extra buck or two or three hell maybe even fourlately (for you meaters) they've branched out and have started stocking grateful grower's sausage and some other hard-to-find nc fine meats as well as their standard italian selectionthere's also a fridge with sauces pastas etc in the pm common market if you don't feel like making the drive down providence and the parking kinda sucks but go at least once rad little store
1,& provisions is amazing  you really should go there now  right now  everything from the homemade pasta ready to eat salads and grilled veggies the sauces the meatballs the wine selection and the focaccia  it's pretty hard not to get wrapped up into buying every item they sell  it's all so fresh and local it's like a dream  and let me tell you a little something about the focaccia  on a recent trip to asheville my uncle asked if i could pick him up two rounds of focaccia  he said "they just don't make focaccia like that up here"  you know it's good when you're taking out of town requests  the entire entity is where it's at  owner tommy george has really created a family atmosphere in this authentic shop  i always walk away with a pep in my step feeling great about supporting this local business and of course hungry  the pasta literally melts in your mouth and the meatballs are the best i've ever had  this food is perfect for dinner parties big family meals andor a quiet date night at home  and of course it's good for you  eat pasta run fasta
1,apologies for this being so long :)"sono nell'amore" - i'm in love  i wanted to burst into a child-like conniption right on the floor because i couldn't buy one (or more) of everythingsomeone hold me  but i digress  this is a fantastic little shop - a lotta stuff packed in a small space & it seems to be quite popular  parking was a smidge daunting but there is more in the backbut be careful since the tiny ally only allows for one car & you might get in the "i'm trying to leave but no i'm trying to come in" face-off  the rear lot is shared with providence sundries & was pretty full when i was there around 12:30ish on a thursdayfound the staff to be super helpful friendly & knowledgeable especially as to which sauce would pair well with what pasta (all homemade in house btw)- one girl (didn't catch her name) offered to show me around the store & explain things when she learned it was my first time in which was a huge help (although the shop is relatively small it's still kind of overwhelming at first)  once the tour was over i wandered about on my own to soak it all in  the atmosphere is easy with music playing in the background at juuust the right volume and a view to the kitchen in the back  one cool thing they do is whenever someone orders any of their fresh pasta they send it sailing from the kitchen to the register up front down a long wire attached to a clip (watch your head) - fun   ps - you choose how you want your pasta cut: angel hair spaghetti linguine or fettuccinethey have a huge menu board up front that spells out exactly what's in each pasta ravioli and sauce so you know just what you're getting  plus you see how natural everything isi walked away with the most delicious greek white bean spread & loaf of rosemary focaccia bread (which i am munching on as we speak)just marvelous  also picked up a pound of fresh garlicrosemary pasta cut fettuccini style (only 2 mins to cook) house-made alfredo and pomodoro sauces and a pound of shrimp ravioli (prebagged)  they even gave me a treat just bc it was my first time there - how awesome is that   they're my new bestest friends :)for those six local house-made items my total came to $30 and change   taking into account i was supporting a local business and getting true fresh items made by those locals i don't think that was half bad  one other thing i like about p&p is that their prices are fixed & do not fluctuate as they see fit any given day like many other places of this type and from what i could gather (didn't ask so) everything is always available - they even give you a "menu" when you check out  this is especially handy if you're trying to plan for a special dinner or get-together  true you are gonna pay more than you would at the grocery store and at times quite a bit more but it really is worth it (especially for many of the "provisions")  once we've munched on the pastas & sauces i'll update this  but as of this moment in time i'm drooling over my newfound love  everyone should visit p&p at least once especially if you love to cook play in the kitchen or even just browse & get ideas for a simple meal for two since they're more they happy to help  ohand they have very reasonable hours including saturday and sunday  see you there :)
1,i am in love with pasta & provisions not just because they have freshly piped cannolis but also because they have such a great selection of fresh italian fare and ingredients plus the employees are ridiculously nice and helpfultheir fridge selection has all sorts of delicious traditional home-made italian goodies: meatballs & marinara stuffed jumbo shells lasagna tiramisu fresh pasta etc if your seeking specialty italian items - this is the place to go they have special canned tomatoes imported pastas wines cheeses etc that will elevate your dish to the next level they also offer large scale meals and catering for the "i'm pretending i can cook italian" dinner parties :)and back the cannolisholy yum this is the first place in charlotte where i've found fresh cannolisif only i could convince them to make them with pistachios mmmm thanks pasta & provisions i'll be back soon
1,and provisions is the best place to get italian food and supplies  every nook and cranny of the place shows how much care they put into creating and sustaining a place where customers can find a taste of italythe staff is amazing as well  they are extremely knowledgeable about ingredients and are just nice to chat with as wellif you love italian or want to try something new p&p is the place to goeat pasta run fasta
1,came here on a trip with a few other girls we had all never been there before and seeked pasta and sauce for a pasta dinner the staff was incredibly helpful and told us exactly how much pasta and sauce we needed we had the garlic and rosemary linguini with their homemade pomodoro and marinara sauce (mix 1 part pomodoro 2 parts marinara) it was incredible we also had meatballs which i highly recommend for $20 we fed 5 hungry runners you only have to boil the fresh pasta for 60-90 seconds so it was really fast toothey have these little chocolates on a shelf called "liquid coffee" for $75 that i got on a whim-so amazing and now i have to find out where else i could find them
1,pasta sauce ravioli and bread  nice joint but it is a market not a restaurant so you can impress someone at home
1,restaurant style pasta delivered to your home or available at some local gluten free retailers nice option for a gluten free menu almost indistinguishable from wheat based pastas
1,you rp's pasta for refining and providing excellent gluten-free pasta  i was exstatic to find your gluten-free lasagna sheets packaged for retail  my lasagna is in the oven right now  i choose to eat gluten-free  i appreciate your tenacity in providing gluten-free fresh pasta at an affordable price  i also appreciate you for working with retailers to meet their needs  i worked with you to source gluten-free lasagna sheets for my gluten-free customers at hy-vee  your staff is always professional  i appreciate your personal interaction  i will always recommend your pastas gluten-free or not because you are a company of integrity
1,am on run of local reviews here and i want to end it on my all time favorite food: pasta  i discovered this local gem at the phoenix farmer's market about a month ago and have enjoyed it ever since  i love to cook pasta dishes and have been known to try my hand at making pasta with varying degrees of success  well these guys make me look pathetic  their pasta is dried and cooks up in a scant 2-4 minutes  the variety of flavors is outrageous: spinach mushroom garlic roasted tomato and so on  these pastas are what i would call stand-alones  you literally need to add nothing to eat for consumption  maybe some nice local olive oil ( mad props to queen creek olive mill ) and some shavings of parm and you are goldeni would almost chug the remaining pasta water if it wasn't so damn hot  love the pasta  and love the fact that it's local people  go local
1,bought some of their pasta last weekend and am in love i am hooked on the basil spinach just a little salt and pepper and good olive oil so good i highly recommend them
1,much for my commitment to consume fewer carbs  i think this pasta could single-handedly kill the already dying atkins industry  i first tried decio pasta at an event at the botanical gardens and was happy to find them again at old town farmers market  this pasta is air-dried and cooks in half the time of ordinary dried pasta and it's unbelievably flavorful  with varieties from artichoke hearts to wild mushroom you can get your veggies out of the way  well not really but it's as close as i get most days  the first time i tried a sample i asked what was in it and couldn't believe it was only a little of the cooking water and a tablespoon or two of butter  while the directions (which i never bothered to read) do recommend you rinse this pasta i never did and never needed to  but i did find i should have done so with the lemon pepper  i'm not sure why this was so much starchier than my favored spinach basil and garlic but it was definitely too stickyat  $6 a package (4 for $20 at the markets) this is one of the best inexpensive meals you can find that doesn't end in "berto"  and who can't boil water
1,up four delicious varieties at the tucson 4th ave street fair made the cilantro chili pasta with sauted shrimp in a garlic butter saucesqueezed fresh lime juice on top when plated simply amazing
1,discovered this today at my local farmer's market and i am now addicted i don't think i can ever go back to store pasta they had samples of the spinach basil garlic pasta and it was delicious when we asked what sauce they used i was shocked to hear just butter and a pinch of salt - all of the flavor came from the pasta itself
1,finished a delicious lunch at india garden and was browsing their charming store searching for a souvenir when a saw decio pasta packages and was intrigued handmade vegetable purees and clearly a local favorite i got a package of the garlic & chive fettuccine as a gift for myself and was on my way after a full day of traveling back to the east coast it was midnight and i couldn't wait another day to try the pasta it exceeded expectations- amazing flavor texture and you can tell in one bite the high quality of this pasta- delicious obviously pricier than a box you can grab at the grocery store but why waste the calories i have to order online to get my fix- but it is well worth the time and money lucky find
1,this gem at roadrunner park farmers market i'm hooked i stay away from pastas because i only love it when slathered with heavy pasta sauce but i indulged in the mushroom linguini and wow that was the best pasta dish i have made at home olive oil and pasta and it's bursting with flavor so simple and so tasty i bought the habanero flavor as well and i can't wait to try that one next i don't think i'll ever buy any other pasta
1,store is first-rate  these people really know their stuff and you can tell that they are passionate about wine and beer making and that they truly believe in their products  i could spend an hour in here just lookingand looking
1,guys are great my husband loves to homebrew and we always go here to get supplies the employees are always friendly and knowledgeable i also love that we can go in say "hey we want to make a beer that tastes like (whatever brand)" and they usually have a recipe for a similar tasting beer or can at least point us in the right directionbonus points to the employee with the massive beard (which my husband is envious of)- thanks for letting us know about how quick of a walk it is to four peaks from brewers connection made for a fun afternoon of shopping for beer supplies and then getting a quick celebratory pint :)
1,you have no clue about homebrewing homebrew supplies or any of the terminology do not hesitate to come in  jeffrey haines is highly knowledgeable friendly and has got myself and many of my comrades started in the art of brewing beer  they have a large collection of partial (or all grain) mash recipes that you can buy as a kit with good directions  check their facebook page for the sale of the month (usually about $30 for a 5 gallon recipe) the only negative's which aren't worth taking a star off for are the directions are in paragraph form (probably to fit on a single page) and the website is awful
1,selection of yeasts malts and hops and all kinds of random cleaners enzymes additives and other stuff that i have no idea what it is if it's for making beer or wine they have it only encountered one time when they didn't have a lacto strain i wanted and they ordered it for me and called me when it was in prices seem pretty standard for homebrew shops they don't skimp on ingredient quality just for a little bit lower price and they aren't ripping anyone off eitherbring in (or email them) your own grain bill or come in and tell them what kind of beers you like and they will help you out or you can just take a look through their recipe books i made their pumpkin porter last year and everyone i know liked it more than four peaks'they always answer any questions i have are always friendly and don't even mind me tasting a few grains of different malts to see the flavor difference between themhighly recommend like getting homebrew supplies (that you have to pay for) from a friend
1,brewing supply store the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly i'm an amateur first time brewer and i had a really positive experience each time i've been there very helpful with all the questions i've had wonderful resource for all your brewing needs
1,brewer supply shop in phoenix staff is helpful and knowledgeable with all aspects of brewing they even do brew outs on the weekend with ash that are pretty cool this place is great for everyone from never brewed before and just interested to prosi go here quite often to use their recipes or my own for brewing if i ever have a question or just want some input on something they never let me down can't say enough about what they do and how they do it
1,legalization may be slowly coming to america these days but in 1979 another green herb started becoming popular (yes hops) when the signing of bill 1377 by jimmy carter made brewing beer at home a legal versus an illicit affair and since then interest in brewing one's own beer has only grown (i have no explanation for the surging popularity of owning chickens but that is a whole different issue) well if you live in tempe and want to start making your own beer rather than paying $9 plus  tax for a local micro-brewed six-pack then this is the place you need to go you can get yourself a starter home brewing kit make your first batch (first born pale ale delicious) and then let your addiction to the use of the already legal and increasingly popular herb hops just keep growing as you improve the quality of your supplies and start making an increasingly varied array of beers to consume on your own or even better start sharing with your friends the store has a big book of possible recipes and you just pick one out they give you a copy and will quickly put together the supplies you need to make the next magical batch of home brew currently i've got the hammered rye pale ale and a local recipe hefeweizen (dry heat wheat) happily fermenting away in my own humble abode by the way if you have questions ask away the folks who work in the store also brew  their own beer and if you join the local arizona society of home brewers you'll see those some folks attending the monthly meeting of that group tasting a multitude of locally brewed beers by your fellow home brewers right along with you hey they might even raise their own chickens as well you never know
1,cannot support this store enough  sure you might be able to get your kit and ingredients cheaper through another website but you will not get the 1 on 1 guidance and direction that comes by visiting these fellas  they are incredibly friendly and always have a good recipe on hand to suggest or recommend  you can get everything you need for brewing beer or wine here including specific and special ingredients that you might want to experiment with  i will always recommend them and support this beautiful local business  the only suggestion i would add is that they offer labels for the diy brewer luckily i've got a guy  if you are even considering home brewing come here and chat with them they are excellent
1,place is great my husband and i started brewing a few years ago and have never gone anywhere else the staff is friendly and knowledgeable it's a great place for beginners and people that have brewed for a while they offer kits and great recipes shared by those more inventive
1,been a regular customer of this place a few years now and really love coming here they have an excellent selection for the relatively small floor space -- the liquid yeast selection alone is impressive and it's rare that i ask for a hop variety they don't carry the staff has always been helpful and friendly to me and very knowledgeable as well i also really like being able to email in an order ahead of timeprices are a little higher here than online but with shipping factored in it's pretty close for most items plus if it's only a few bucks more i'd rather put the money into the local economy and get my stuff immediately
1,stop home brew shopping for the tempeeast valley area  these guys have been in the business for over 20 years and can answer any questions you might have  a great selection of equipment as well as plenty of recipes and ingredients on hand make this the only place you need to go for your home brewing needs
1,drink coffee like it's my job columbia street roastery is definitely the place to go to buy coffee or espresso beans not to mention support local business they carry a variety of flavors decaf  caf blends and there are quite a few choices when it comes to fair trade or organic  looking for something to do on a saturday they offer tours of the plant and complimentary tastes   during the summer months they have a booth setup at the lincoln square mall's farmers market too
1,think it's amazing that champaign has its own coffee roasters  i think it's totally omfg crazyawesome that said coffee is actually really really delicious  and reasonably priced (helloooo under $11pound)  and you can get great blends or beautiful single-origin  or a multitude of flavored coffees  or tea  or various coffeetea accessories  and: if you buy 10 1lb bags of coffee you get the 11th free  what kind of wonderfulness is that
1,admit i'm fairly new to the serious coffee game but most anyone can tell the good stuff from the badand man does columbia street roast some delicious coffee i can't speak to any of the flavored coffees since i've stuck to their single-origin and organic fair-trade coffee blends (yeah yeahi'm one of those people) but what i've had has been absolutely delicious the staff is always friendly and eager to help you find exactly what you needif you're a regular don't forget to ask for a coffee punch card buy 10 half-pound (or one-pound) bags and get a bag free free coffee yes pleaseoh i almost forgot they have lots of tea as well immediately to your right when you enter the store i haven't sampled any of them but it looked like they have a nice selection
1,tasty helpful what more could i ask for dropped in on a busy saturday things were frantic but the employees were still helpful no need to buy grocery store or out of town coffee again
1,did it smell fantastic in there  and the owner is pretty much the nicest most helpful man in town  after having one of their blends at escobar's (next door delicious) my family and i were looking in the window bummed that they were closed on a sunday but thinking the shop looked cute  the owner happened to walk by and let us in for what amounted to a private tour  he is one of those people that seems to know what you like more than you do -- he was asking us to describe things that we enjoy drinking  eating and he helped us to select the coffee (and tea in my mom's case) that would best suit us  he was very generous with both his time and coffee spending time to discuss the various production methods and their effects on taste  i learned a lot
1,i have since tasted two more of columbia street roastery's coffees -- the guatemala huehuetenango and the mocha java bold blend  i preferred the guatemalan coffee -- nutty with berry and chocolate notes [at least that is what i detected] but both coffees are so good that my french press is getting a lot of action these days
1,came here for a coffee cupping with a small group  the staff spent over an hour with us taking us through the roastery and going through how coffee is made  the cupping was fascinating and we really learned how to properly taste good coffee  the guatemalan coffee that they served was incredible
1,live in the area and popped in one afternoon since we had a gift card the owner asked if we'd ever been before and gave us a tour and recommendations he was very friendly and knowledgeable and the coffee was delicious (we buy whole bean and grind the coffee ourselves)we've gone back several times to purchase pounds of coffee as gifts for friends and family terrific local business
1,have not purchased coffee anywhere else by colombia st in years  it is simply the best i love to go in and talk to the staff they are know their coffee and are happy to tell you about it they also make great recommendations i've tried many different varieties my favorite is the dominican gold (single bean) and i also like the black velvet ( a blend ) you can't go wrong here i used to grind my own coffee but i found that when you ask them to grind it for a french press the grind is more even and consistent than my poor grinder  also they give you a punch card and after you buy 10 pounds of coffee you get one free so don't forget to ask for one i don't drink tea but they have a bunch of it probably worth checking out if you're a tea fan
1,coffee selection knowledgable and friendly staff  it's just plain tasty coffee roasted right  this is strictly a roastery so there's no on-site coffee or espresso but if you can try a cupping they're awesome and you'll learn a lot while you have some fun
1,i began my search for the perfect home brewing kit i checked countless websites and message boards on what to get and how much money to spend on the ideal home brewing kit  after a month or so of research i had a pretty good idea of what to get in order to make the perfect batch of sh*t face sauce  when i got there i realized all my careful weeks of research and  planning had been in vein  the dude that was there who i think was the owner was more than helpful on explaining every bit of the home brewing process along with some of the science behind it  he informed me that a lot of the things being sold in some of the home brewing kit were unnecessary which in the end saved me moneyso i've been successfully home brewing and even when i ran into a little stuck fermentation problem i walked into vegas home brew and quickly got an answer and some yeast activator on the house to fix my problem  they have a great supply of grains and extracts as well as a full refrigerator of different yeasts  i plan on going back any day now to start another batch of brew i encourage every body to visit vegas homebrew and start brewing their own beer  not only is it fun it will get ya drunk
1,know a lot of beer drinkers out there that have never considered brewing their own beer  i guess it isn't a hobby for everyone but i have recently discovered the awesomeness that is brewing your own beer  vegas homebrew has been an incredible help to me as someone who has just brewed his first batch of beer  the only place in town this place is ran by two friendly fellows and experienced home brewers  they'll talk to you all day about brewing beer and will help you purchase only the things that you need to start soon i will be a good yelper and get some photos of this little store for you folks to see  he's got grains hops extract kits for new brewers kegs a huge fridge full of yeasts and tons of other equipment  so far i picked up a 5 gallon plastic fermenting bucket an extract kit and a few odds and ends like sanitizer and extra airlocks the total bill for my equipment and ingredients for my first batch was well under $90  i encourage everyone who is into good beer to look into homebrewing and if you do start out at vegas homebrew  brewing beer is fun and it really isn't hard at all  i can't wait to try my first batch of ipa
1,just got into home brewing and i've been to the only two stores in town vegas homebrew is the store to go to steve was very helpful and informative he knows his beer he has very good prices and will set you up to make any beer you like
1,god does this guy know his stuffwe went in for a few supplies to brew our own beer for the first time ever and was amazed at the supplies and knowledge we got the owner is a real down to earth dude that knows his stuff he is the authority in town on how towhen to and what to doonce our first batch is done fermenting and such we'll go back and try different hops varieties and yeast strainssuch a cool place support your local stores
1,place is awesomewhy:steve the owner one man band gave complete attention to myself and whoever he was talking to on the phone i had asked somewhere like a billion plus one questions and steve happily answered everything in thorough explanation for example  i'm sure steve is constantly bombarded everyday by people asking "i wanna start but i don't know what to do" and although he probably has told the procedure more times than you've heard the word beer; never hesitate to explain to this newbie what:there are several home brew kits available for wine and beer and all the supplies you'll need are here you can go with the simple syrup homebrew to more advance kits like a hazelnut brown ale from rogue or he has all the grains malts hops and etc you'll need to make your own or imitate your favorite the prices are really fair compared to the internet prices it was only a mere few dollars in difference shop local
1,shop is an amazing resource and you can't discuss it without mentioning it's proprietor steve is encyclopedic in his knowledge of all things brewing related and is absurdly helpful between his ownership of the place and the worth of his expertise he could be a world class asshole and still get regular business and yet he is one of the nicest hardest working guys you'll find anywhere and super helpful he kinda stepped up my brewing when he suggested i move from kits to working with clone beers which is actually a great intermediate step when you think about itanother odd trick is that somehow despite being a fairly small retail space everything you need is here if you required kingsfoil for a mythical beer you were brewing in fairyland he would likely have it drying in the back i'd shop here if it were overpriced just to pick the proprietor's brain but it's actually really solid prices plus no shipping fees there's nowhere else that need be mentionedfair warning: it can get really busy in here and there's only one dude working so if you want a fair amount of assistance with something go mid-day during the week also not open mondaysgo for the reasonably priced equipment; keep going for the expert advice when you screw something up
1,and friendly employees made my first brewing experience an outstanding one  when the first beer was done we only wanted to make more  they we very open to beginners and answered all of our questionseven when we called up while brewing at home  my wife even commented on how helpful and welcoming they were  highly recommend home brewing and this store in particular
1,and knowledgeable help wish this place was closer to us
1,place is great like all the other reviews you must mention steve honest nice approachable and incredibly helpful i used to buy a lot of my stuff online thinking i was getting a better deal (some cases it was true) however in reality i started doing a comparison with shipping costs (we can't get everything off of amazon) wait time quality and the ease of accessibility you're actually better off going here the cost is comparable if not better here also did i mention steve and his rad factor seriously you're supporting a local business which if you live here you know how important that is and you get the benefit of objective knowledge and information about cool beer and wine events this is a great resource for a guy who is passionate about what he does and he deserves our supportalso i want to note the selection of inventory is very decent as well his inventory is always changing and fresh nothing seems to sit on the shelves for too long steve has never tried to up sell me on anything and always provides me with insightful options to improve my beer
1,went here armed only with knowledge of a one time home brew done with a mrbeer kit the shop is small at the very end of a strip mall we entered and was immediately greeted by the owner we had tons of questions and he answered them in detail and was incredibly knowledgeable we purchased a starter home brewing kit and he actually had a list he made himself of steps to home brewing and gave us his name and number in case we had any questions about the process he was also incredibly cheerful it's nice to run into great customer service and expertise in one place
1,awesome  the owner brews gluten free beer on his own as well so he gave me a quick rundown of how to do it guided me right thru  the prices are great and he states he will hold your own brews at his location if you need a good stable temperature for fermentation up until it is bottledhe also carries many micro brews to sell individual cooled beers and also the multipacks  btw he tends to carry dogfish head quite a bit he even had some of the 120 minute ipa which is hard to come by
1,brew selection everyone here is willing to help one of our favorite spots
1,a great place to go for homebrew supplies the store is spotlessly clean very well organized and well laid out the staff there is very friendly and knowledgeable about homebrewing just about anything also you do not feel intimidated if you lack certain knowledge about the brewing process because they are there to help they have about everything you need for all your brewing needs and at a very reasonable price i will surly return to byob for my homebrew needs
1,here from california  i was so sad to leave my lhbs but was pleasantly surprised with byob  helpful staff and solid inventory of ingredients  some of their prices are higher than other online retail shops but not by much  for me i don't mind throwing a couple bucks to a local business
1,supplies for a home brew and i work in mesa i thought i was going to have to drive all the way into tempe and get stuff from "those other guys" i completely forgot about a small little store in a business park i remember seeing every day when i drive to work (like an idiot) much to my surprise these guys were awesome i may have been the only guy in the store but they gave me superb service advice and showed me around a little bit the store was very clean and organized with almost everything in stock i will continue to make this my only lhbs and recommend them to all
1,is my first (liberally given) 5-star rating a clean organized stocked store the crew will help you choose any style they have capacity to brew and if they are out of a pre-made kit they will assemble it in a hurry sure you can mill your own grains but having jacob do it while i wait is satisfactory in the sense that i know they are willing to help without hesitation *unlike service i have gotten from the 'other' placethey have a little basket of toys so the kids are kept occupied while i shop a nice touch and if you have toddlers you'll "get it" this store is worthy of a visit even if you live in tempe a gem i'll be returning here time and again - mike s
1,stumbled upon this place by accident one day while running errands and i'm damn glad that i did  not only is it a closer homebrew store than that outfit in tempe but it's far and away a better store  it's very open and clean and they've got all the supplies and equipment that you'll ever need  the staff is great offering up great advice and even putting on brewing classes from time to time  their grain room is something to behold as well
1,customer service great selection for my beer brewing needs and reasonable prices i am so happy to have this place within a few miles of my house everyone i've dealt with has been incredibly helpful knowledgeable and not snobbish or pretentious the place is also clean and well organized my brewing activity has increased since finding this place because it's such a pleasure to go get suppliesyou might be able to get slightly better prices by shopping online but then you're dealing with shipping and waiting and worrying about heat in transit and there's less opportunity to learn something new or ask questions about the product you're buying besides supporting the local economy trumps a few percentage points in overall savings
1,you to to all grain brewing this is the store where you need to go as they have a walk in grain room and you can taste the grain you are using in your all-grain brewing in addition the staff is extremely courteous and helpful i've received some great tips from them on improving my brewing just a first class operation
1,started making mead a couple of years ago and the staff here was very helpful and answered questions my favorite thing about this place is that it is one of the only brew stores that hasn't treated me like i were a lost child i just love this place
1,their free class really helped to get us started brewing now we're on our third batch in and the staff has been nothing but helpful their kits make it easy to get started as well go try it out
1,is a relaxing place from the minute you walk in the door  they offer yoga classes that fit into everyone's busy schedule and weekend retreats which focus on self care and well being  the class  and workshopretreat sizes are small so it's more welcoming and a more personal experience
1,mwc is definitely an oasis in our busy lives check out their schedule and attend one of their programs for an overall good feeling
1,just attended my first yoga class at mcleod wellness center it was not easy to find a little more instruction or "clues' of what to watch for when i called to make my appointment to sign up (ex: turn when you see building no 6240 our building is in the back not visible from the street) would have been most helpful as i almost turned around after going up and down the street for 15 minutesi almost missed this wonderful place karen taught the class and it  was such a wonderful unexpected surprise she was so kind and really knew her "stuff" upon walking in i was offered a wonderful chai tea (iced) and they also have cucumber water or hot tea i sat in a lovely waiting room with a very relaxed atmosphere relaxed lighting and spa music you can tell this was very well thought out the room or studio itself is very small but fortunately the class was small so it worked out fine she took some time to find out what some of our issues were and tailored the class to suit our needs which was awesome she incorporated a tiny bit of reiki (again so cool) aroma therapy (smelled amazing the oils were from a company called "tree of india") and she used this beautiful  bowlchime at the end of the session which  gave out an exquisite vibration my goal for the week: learn about those chimes i loved ittheir prices are on the high side but the quality of personal attention and genuine care and knowledge i received from karen tells me in the long run it will be an excellent investment in my  health and well being  i purchased a living social coupon to try them out which made my initial introduction to this place very affordablei never imagined potentially spending a lot on my  yoga practice but after attending one class i do believe i will purchase their three month unlimited programi'm going back again tomorrow (sunday) for their yoga and meditation class can't wait to see what other surprises are in store
1,j has it spot on this place is the best i am just getting started with yoga and i can't imagine going anywhere else the classes are extremely small (and consequentially not intimidating at all) and the instructor and staff are delightful i have been to other places where yoga is a giant scary class with 40 other people which makes it sort of daunting to get startednot so here the personal attention and the good energy are unbelievable you will leave class feeling the best you ever have :) really do yourself a favor and check this place out
1,wellness center is three things: quality quality & quality  i had the pleasure of taking my first class at this studio with karen and i sincerely feel like a new man  if you read any of my reviews i only take the time to write about outstanding companies or services  thus this review  i can't recommend classes here enough  i sincerely feel great the mcleod wellness center gets a "run don't walk award"  enroll and get here as soon as you can
1,is my home away from home :) it is a bright light that shines my way i feel the peace radiating from alaric
1,have worked with rev alaric  he changed my life and i can't recommend him enough  i now have real tools to help myself out in any situation  he helped me move from from feeling trapped and miserable to feeling free and hopeful  i really can not express how grateful i am that i had the opportunity to experience alaric's style of coaching  i quickly saw changes in my life and it is very reasonably priced  if you want positive changes to happen in your life earth spirit center is the place to be :)

1,have been going to alaric for the past month for peace of mind and guidance he is a full of helpful knowledge and is a wonderful spirit  you will feel right at ease with him and he listens without judgment since i have been going to the earth spirit center i have felt much more at peace and have gained some helpful skills to use in my everyday life i know i still have a ways to go but is has been a great beginning  i will definitely be taking advantage of the other helpful courses at the earth spirit center thank you  alaric for all of your help
1,and his business earth spirit center for healing is such a wonderful place to visit alaric's teachings for inner peace are profound and effective anyone who needs more peace love or joy in their lives needs to go see alaric not only is he the best in town at what he does his pricing is very affordable you owe it to yourself to see what alaric can do for you i have been a life coaching client of his and i am now a student and i have attended the sunday morning circle of peace the whole community is wonderful i can not recommend earth spirit center for healing highly enough
1,relaxing combined with the meditation  and reiki i'm still floating somewhere out in space and breathing so much better this was my first time and i will definitely be back
1,must be place thank you jodi for an amazing meditationreiki experience at the salt room yesterday the atmosphere and the energy of the place was relaxing and inspiring looking forward to next week
1,place this salt room helps me to breath better and the crew was very kind and helpful i definitely will go back and they have this  amazing playground for kids thank you salt room for a great time
1,some reason i had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress maybe i was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place abd mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears i may have had the store was empty when i arrived on a monday afternoon and i was attended to immediately and never felt pressured abd has a great selection of mattresses and the prices cannot be beat i picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame since i already had one) better yet delivery is free and prompt you pick a three-hour timeframe and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon
1,a mattress buying novice i also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy i also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews anyway i had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress if it's terrible you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem who wants that especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress these people were great they patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times i called the man on the phone remembered my name (and number) and took care of me when i failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did i think i could go without a box spring) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the same day within hours even they even helped me set up the mattress that i didn't purchase from them which blew me away their professionalism and friendliness are excellent i will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress especially students because their student deals are fantastic
1,only place to buy a mattressboth my wife and i and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so i decided to check this place out we went on a sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store lee greeted us and showed us around the store they offer mattresses recliners dinettes daybeds bunk beds and bedroom furniture we found her a great mattress at a great price while waking around the store my wife found a serta icomfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through wells fargo bank free bed frame free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer i went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but i bought us a new one as well no one can beat their prices i compared the price of our new mattress to levin macy's and mattress discounters no one came close to the price we got at american buyers everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free take it from me when it comes to your sleep do not buy a cheap mattress we bought a cheap supposed serta mattress in 2008 from mattress discounters the boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed i don't think i will have that problem again as our new serta has a full 25 year warranty a couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered the delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutesi highly recommend american buyers discount mattress for all of your bedding needs

1,agoi was looking for someone to service my grandfather clocks in my home after extensive researchi ran across these folks i couldn't be happier with the result of their visitation the knowledge they possess and the professionalism with which they practiceis impeccable all of my clocks are running at peak performance;they even took the time to look at my "black forest" cuckoo clocks and passed on valuable advice as to how i should maintain them i graciously appreciate their timedemeanorand service i wish no one else to service my clocks in the future you cannot go wrong with these folks highly recommended thank-you so much for all that you have done to restore my precious time pieces
1,can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at paul's clock repair  i needed an atmos clock repaired which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away  i needed it done on a short time line since i live out-of-town and was leaving soon  it is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where i live  they were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time  much thanks to lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up  my atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle
1,love this store i can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my houseall of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customersthey even cut keys that actually work
1,have purchased a few items from this company over the years as it is located just about a mile from my house  yes they are expensive but as the old saying goes "you get what you pay for"  in particular about 15 years ago i purchased an outdoor furniture set called winston (48" round glass table 4 ultra high back chairs recliner and an ottoman)  these were the sling style at the time it was hard to swallow the price but the sales rep promised me the quality was untouchable  well the sales rep was right  i have had some neighbors go through multiple sets of "cheaper" outdoor furniture over the years  well after 15 years finally the fabric started to give as i and my girlfriend both broke through the fabric my girlfriend wanted to throw them out and buy new from a big box store i was tempted to do that but then decided to look into spray painting the very durable aluminum frames and buying replacement slings for them  i am very handy and decided to install the new slings myself to save some money  i ran into a couple of road blocks as it was not as straight forward as it might sound i called the store and spoke to a marcy who was very helpful  instead of pushing me away or trying to sell me new she allowed me to speak to the tech who gave me a few suggestions  the result is we now have absolutely beautiful outdoor furniture again that is as comfortable as it was 15 years ago  they look brand new and we are really glad we took the effort to re-do them  we never would have been able to do this with the "cheaper" furniture  thanks to marcy tom and others at the fireplace and patio place for being so helpful  it made the initial price not so bad after all  in fact if you do the math these are now downright inexpensive if you divide the price paid by the number of years we go out of them  so it does pay to buy good quality stuff and this store has plenty of good qualitywe also purchased a stainless steel tec grill about 13 years ago and the same hold true for that my friends laughed at me when they heard how much i paid for it but they have gone through many cheaper grills and mine still looks brand new  i did have to replace a few parts and the glass cooking plate a few times but it still looks and operates as good as it did on day 1we also purchased a 2 different gas logs sets for our 2 fireplaces although we don't really use them much these days  maybe if the price of natural gas comes down we might use them more
1,from the botanical emporium did my wedding flowers and they were absolutely beautiful they were so easy to work with and made me feel completely at ease my flowers were everything i ever wanted and more when i saw my bouquet it actually brought tears to my eyes the greenhouse is amazing  i very highly recomend the botanical emporium for all of your floral needs
1,a cool place i have no green thumb whatsoever but had passed by for about a year now since i moved to dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute now was my chance as i needed a last minute christmas present for my grandma the place is larger than you think from the outside they actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants i couldn't identify i thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase not in a pot and looked really cool and modern i loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself if i wouldn't kill it (which i probably would) i had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art they turned out to be flower displays for hotels but man where they cool if i was doing an event or having a wedding that's exactly what i would have wanted they just looked really modern but creative they also have some winged friends you can say hi to including one screaming one in the back that you can't see kinda creepy but i guess that comes with a unique shop i will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events i have coming up
1,is a great kitchen store  they have a cooking demonstration room that you can rent out  my wife had her bridal shower here and her guests loved it  it was different than the typical stale shower; plus everyone got a discount that day to shop the storethey have all kind of gourmet gadgets & appliances that you'd see in williams-sonoma but the prices are a little better i think  the staff is super helpful and will go out of their way to help you  look for their all-clad "seconds" sales  this is when all-clad merchandise is on sale that has minor (and i mean minor) defects  you can get top notch pots and pans at half the price  we stocked our kitchen with them and they are amazing  it's the kind of deal where maybe there is a scratch on them but really you're going to use them once and scratch them up anyway  seriously go visit these folks
1,sister has a bucket list - and from this bucket list i bought her christmas gift this year one of her items was to learn how to make sushi i asked around and found crate a friend of mine had taken a sushi class there and loved it so i had total confidence in buying the class for my sister and i to do together when i first searched they didn't have a sushi class on the schedule i emailed them to find out and they said to check back in the spring as i was scrambling two weeks before christmas to figure something else out to get my sister they emailed me and said that they added a sushi class for february and for me to go register so i'd have it in time for my sister for christmas it was really nice because i had already started looking for something else so great on the sales end on their partthere were 18 people in our class and we were in the demonstration kitchen we learned how to roll three different types of sushi and all of the steps that go along with it everyone had such a great time making their own sushi and eating it too i signed up for the email newsletter and i'm already thinking of occasions to rent it out for private parties it made a great gift; my sister loved it
1,is such a gorgeous boutique -- shabby chic furnishings galore if you're in the market for truly unique special furniture and live anywhere near pittsburgh hot haute hot is the place you're looking for i came here with my friend who had long been on a quest to find a new dining room table the options here were so gorgeous i was immediately struck with envy there are curio cabinets amazing reclaimed ceiling tile mirrors plush chairs fantastic lamps and a bevy of side tables wall hangings and of course dining room tables the service is impeccable -- sweet helpful women who know every item in their shop and are just as excited to help you shop as you are to find perfect item the taste level in this store is impressive as well as a bonus they have a few displays of fun affordable jewelry ranging from delicate to super funky take your time to pick through this shop and enjoy yourself while doing it -- i certainly did
1,husband and i moved to mt lebanon last year from out of state and we love going to rollier's neither of us are particularly "handy" so when we go there we rely on the staff working in the departments to help us with our home repair needs together we have gone to talk to different people about: indoor paint to combat smoke smell de-humidifiers & outdoor gardens and have always received friendly well-rounded and detailed information a man even helped me figure out how to hang curtains without using a power drill when i came in very flustered not being able to get screws directly into the wall (i told you guys i wasn't handy)i also want to praise rollier's for their selection of high end pet foods i think they should advertise this more because it is very difficult to find these pet foods in the south hills they brands including but not limited to: orijien fromm's wellness & taste of the wild we do rotation feeding with our pets so a variety of high end pet foods is a must i hope they start carrying addiction pet foods soon would also be great if they carried bio-bags bio-degradable dog waste bagsmy husband and i are on a modest income but we prefer to support local business as much as we can we will continue to shop here because of the friendly knowledgeable staff convenient to location to our home and wide-range of products
1,a home project or problemask the experts at rolliers  they can help you fix it or they repair many things like screens and lampsneed seasonal lights and decorations  rolliers has it  check out the xmas display of studio 56 stuff  the kids love it  big kids toogreat place to pick up items and get assistance  need some work cloths rolliers has it  need paint window blinds household items electrical items rolliers has itthe staff just assisted teaching me in how to repair a few items and help save me a ton of $'s  price wise most items are competitive with other hardware places  sometimes a little more but the experts are worth it
1,hardware storetop notch plumbing sectionvery knowledgeable
1,is a fantastic hardware store i found a really old chrome 1930's fan at trader jack's flea market last sunday super cool find anyway  it had a dryrotted electric cord and a bad 3 speed pull chain type switchrolliers had an exact replacement for the switch and a retro vintage looking cloth covered electric cord i was very impressedthe staff was very helpful and happy to assist me  ( unlike the jagoff's at lowes and home depot)support local  i cant stress this enough with some advice and tip's from my favorite electronics store in squirrel hill my fan is all cleaned up and running like a top
1,customer service knowledgable and friendly associates who made buying a new grill an enjoyable experience this will be our go to hardware store from now on
1,those hardware stores you see on tv  movies where the you can go and know that you will get reliable help well rolliers is that place the concept of customer service and expertise is not something of a past era i have been here more than a dozen times for reasons and i have never left disappointed i walked in with door knob pieces for a 100 year old door - not only did they know exactly what i was looking for they had dozens to choose from to make sure that i had the exact ones i needed i could only imagine the look of bewilderment that i would get if i walked into that big orange or blue "home centers" with the same questions i have gone back since and will continue to go back over and over again because i trust what i am told when i ask questions - something that is hard to find these days yeah some of the items might be a little more costly (not much from my experience) but that extra pays for customer service that you don't get from someplace that is concerned with shareholder profits i would rather pay a little more and know that i am getting what i need for the job the first time rather than wasting my time over and over again
1,a new bike can be a big decision  buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision  buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision and lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown cash only and offers no warrantiesreturns seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions  but some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to ok experience when doing all of the abovephoenix produce is selling fujiton e-bikes straight off the boat from china  and we're not talking "made in china" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately chinesefrom the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the mandarincantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lightsphoenix produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 mph  while they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles respectively on a single charge  the motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motori've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v  both plug directly into a 110v (normal) outlet  the 36v costs a little more than 3 cents per charge these are bikes so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths  no licenseregistrationinsurancehelmet required (legally per ars 28-2516)though the helmet is recommendedas for the no warranties and returns parti can only say what i've experienced  sam the owner of phoenix produce has been very good to me in all my dealings  i had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike making the first week of ownership less than stellar  fortunately i talked to sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no chargesure seemed like a warranty; but jenny one of his employees said "he is just really fair"  and i have to agree  for the price you cannot beat them approximately $500 a little higher or lower depending on the model of your choice
1,have the best ebike prices in town they are local and can fix and repair any problem i bought 2 from them and they were very good
1,here to drop few items from my location to this company  this location is easy to find and plenty of parking right by chase field
1,is where i pick up my bountiful basket occasionally  while the food for the co-op is already packaged up for the pick-up they also have other offerings available at great prices there is ample parking and super friendly staff  i've even had people help me out with my bounty
1,place is great i wish i had found it before our last day and on the way to the airport this place has fresh fruits and nuts and breads there are a bunch of samples and quite a good selection of items the staff is also very nice we picked up a loaf of pumpkin bread as a thank you for our ride from the airport once we got home i think they liked it i know we loved our samples if you are in the area i definitely would go in to this place i think it is probably a bit more than the market but the produce is very fresh
1,is my favorite place to visit for some delicious fruit sandwiches and incredibly friendly people upon entering the staff will offer you free samples of the fruit they have to offer i enjoy picking up local or organic fruits and vegetables and supporting the last remaining fruit stand left along baseline rd before the push to build along south mountain there were several others that lined the street when the city of phoenix widened the road they took away the left hand turn to make it easily into the parking lot i refuse to let such an inconvenience keep me from a place that i share with all of my friends when i can get the chance if you want to support a local business experience real hospitality and find something delicious to eat then i highly recommend summers fruit barn
1,got something of a love affair with this place it's becoming a regular part of my life now and i am okay with thatin the past i would go here for lunch their freshly made sandwiches are absolutely delicious given that i now work about 25 miles from here that's somewhat difficult so instead i now go here after my early morning south mountain hikes turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well i believe the general consensus amongst my friends and i has been "heaven in our mouths"on top of that their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled delicious fresh fruit (of which they're usually handing out samples) local honey locally made salad dressings salsas jams and much much more make this place to die for i get all of my best fruit here without a doubtone thing to note though is that you should bring cash here there is a small additional charge for paying with your credit card as it's expensive for them to process
1,this place and everyone needs to gt the okra it is amazing and super easy to fry :)
1,people very friendly amazing prices
1,do you go when an alaskan wants to take a box of oranges homesummers  they also ship  on a saturday i could head west or south and find any number of estebans and juans selling naranjas elotes y muy mas from the back of a pickup or car  wednesday  baseline road once the home of many fruit vegetable and flower merchants  summers is the last one in phoenix and a good one it is  clean neat a wide variety of fruits produce jellies sauces salsa honey dried fruits nuts dates bread and a host of old timey tourist products like cactus candy grow a saguaro cactus agave etc kits and things i can't remember this evening  they also have newer items like scorpion pops - the embedded scorpion bolos or any bolo are out of fashion long live scorpion suckers  if you bake bread you must add value right  summers has a large variety of fresh breads and a wheat field's worth of of sandwich choices plus a milk parlor's worth of shakes and a mango plantation worth of smoothies  it's a great place  don't keep driving past like me  swing by get some produce grab a sandwich and drink and sit down at a table under the east portico and enjoy old-style az
1,are delicious
1,everything
1,in phoenix so great all year aroundi come to phoenix a couple times a year on business and one of a handful of things i do without fail is come to summers fruit barn if i'm having a rough week just going there is relaxing to me it is essentially an old classic roadside attraction that offers some amazing stuffthe place has been there as long as i can remember way back when baseline road was quite rural and now that the area is growing up all around it i really hope summers stays my trips to the area would be incomplete without a stop by to pick up some goodiesgreat people simple style excellent seasonal collection cash is best but not requiredi saw "k d's" review said he returned honey but over on google kabir duggal (same person) griped about returning bread methinks kabir has a personal problem with summers i'd take that review with a grain of salt
1,favorite spot for lunch on the weekends  you order up your food in a little farmhouse  pick from a selection of farm fresh sandwiches salads soups and fresh baked goods  everything is very good  then grab a picnic table in the pecan grove and enjoy the fresh air arizona sunshine and serene view of south mountain stretching before you  this is a great place to take the whole family  the kids can run around and play while you enjoy a meal out  a perfect day in the country without having to leave the city
1,went to the farm to check out the farmer's market and go to lunch  it was amazing  i can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house  it's almost hard to believe it's even in phoenix - though to a native like me it's just one more reason to remember why phoenix is so great  when most folks used to think of south phoenix they thought of crime blight and anything else associated with being on the "wrong" side of the tracks  sure there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that but most of south phoenix was all farming community  while some of this still exists - especially near and in laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so  most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers  the farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between baseline and southern   to put this in perspective - there is a huge targetfry'srossapplebee's kind of complex at 24th and baseline - and the south mountain community college is just north of that on 24th  at 32nd and baseline there is the raven golf course with lots of condos all around it  that all seems a whole world away once you pull in to the farmi'm attaching some pictures from their web site wwwthefarmatsouthmountaincom  i've been only to one of the restaurants so far - the farm kitchen which is their lunch spot  but i plan to visit morning glory soon  all the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows  as we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley or sold at their farmers market to be eaten in their own homecheck out their menus online  yes - it's a bit pricey  i was hesitant that i'd think it was "worth it"  but oh it was  i can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - you can taste the freshness  everything just tasted so much better  not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor  one interesting thing to mention - pets are ok  there were two folks there who brought their dogs  the doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench  i'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times  i'd love to try out their yoga andor gardening classes too this will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town  better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley
1,favorite spot for lunch on weekends god  i hate you guys this restaurant makes me want to move to tempe  does not compare to one not even one sandwich place i can think of in the east bay  i got the pecan chicken salad sandwich and billy got the steak sandwich hands down best sandwich this side of the fucking mississippi  all outdoor seating so be forewarned if the weather is not good you'll have to maybe escape to an air conditioned car somewhere to enjoy your mayo while it's still goodone thing i just can't understand  we were steered to this place by two peeps at the fry's down the street after atleast five minutes of head scratch  now wait one goshdern second people  how could you even question the all supreme sandiwch gods when it comes to the caliber of this place  please  if i worked at a fry's nearby this place would be my fucking fall back plan in a second  i'll stop now
1,went for brunch on the recommendation of some friends that live in the area  what a great choice  the setting is fantasticyou're just outside in a great little garden area  and the food was amazing  i'm a bit of a champagne nut (i think i mention champagne in every review i write) and i loved the fact that they give you a mini bottle and a mini carafe of oj to mix yourself  i also found it funny that the woman at the table next to ours used all of her oj and i used only a little bitmmmmmits just to color right ;)
1,place is great but i am partial to anywhere that offers outside dining possibilities actually it's only outside dining picnic tables to be exactthe farm is just that with an attached lunch counter to get chicken salad sandwiches with pecans both fresh from on site tons of tall shady trees picnic tables and wandering ducks and birds to delight the kiddies
1,is some classy brunch  i love ithot damn it was warm this morning but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like the farm at south mountain  i was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed  (fyi it closes every summer from june - september)you pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge and shady (in a good way) farm before you  at the morning glory cafe the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone  lots of veggie options to be had here btw (bonnie would drool with desire here)the food is really incredible  they had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame  it had eggs and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread  ahh  it was missing the bechamel sauce but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus  how did they know that's my favorite veggie  i attribute it to kismet of course  it was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil  nicethe patio is cute in a rustic way  think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs  not exactly sexy but hey it fits in the grand scheme of the farm  they have a self serve area for water lemonade and tea  the mimosas here are the best part  for only $750 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice  so you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half service here was a bit slow to start  but after paying the check i spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name  (even better is their scones are featured in cooking light magazine too  man i love this place) so i give in place an order and ask for it to go  she brings it out  i ask to pay in cash since she already ran my debit card and she says "don't worry about it"  classy  classy with a c  the scone was delicious btw  nice touch and i leave her an extra tip for it prices are higher than average for phoenix  expect to throw down about $40 for two  but let me tell ya that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while i am now eager to try the other restaurants here  now if only september would hurry up and arrive
1,can't say enough good things about this place  i was introduced to it when a couple of friends of mine got married here  i am still impressed by it five years later  there are a few eating options here a couple of restaurants and a large picnic area  it's an oasis in the middle of south phoenix  the area around it is nice too the old farming lifestyle all around  if you weren't around in phoenix twenty years ago you can see the type of farming pockets that used to exist in more frequency around the city  the only thing missing is an orange orchard with the trees painted white at the trunks
1,is about the only reason i miss my old job: it was right around the corner from "the farm"the first time i went i thought it was so peaceful to be in a city  i love the outdoor picnic tables and their potato salad is to die for  it reminds me of my small town back east  friendly open-air with good homemade food
1,took my out-of-town visitor here based on the rave reviews other yelpers gave it and let me just say there was no disappointment  it was a bit chilly because we had to eat outside in mid-january but they had heat lamps out to make sure people didn't freeze their arses off (however it would be wise to bring a jacket depending on how sensitive to cold ya are)as soon as we got there a nice young waitress brought out a basket of scones and muffins in case we wanted to buy any for $295  i had some kind of almond sweet delicious-ness of a muffin and it was well worth the 3 bucks  i then ordered a la carte and had eggs and rosemary taters  my friend had a mushroom and tomato omelette  boy did we enjoy ourselves  it was a very pleasant airy light-hearted kind of environment complete with little finches chirping and flitting about here and there as if you were in the movie "willow" or something  my friend couldn't deny the finches crumbs from her tasty herbed biscuit  if it were me i woulda scarfed down the whole thing and said to hell with the finches either way we both had a wonderful time  it was a great way to end her visit to arizona before her flight back to north carolina  although the prices were a little bit on the higher side (hovering around 10 bucks a dish including bottomless coffee) it was well worth it  and it's also refreshing to visit a breakfast place that actually attempts to be organic and doesn't deep-fry everything it serves
1,not much which hasn't already been said  i had brunchbreakfast with my fiance a friend and an out of towner with his friend  we had breakfast at the morning glory cafe and it was delicious  three of us had mimosas (thanks kristin for the tip on those - they were delicious and too cute with the individual bottles) and the serve yourself beverage bar was convenient  i had french toast with a side of potatoes and my fiance had the monte cristo with a side of bacon  i would recommend both entrees  we both ate all of our food (which was a lot) and didn't feel overly full which was nice  the potatoes were delicious and the bacon was so-so  you would think for $250 you would get 3-4 thick juicy slices of bacon  instead you get 2 kinda puny nothing-to-write-home-about stripsthe atmosphere is fun and earthy  too bad it was overcast and a little chilly  otherwise it would have been perfect  it's a nice setting in the midst of "the farm" complete with veggies growing and chickens in the coop (beware of the smell folks if you wander in that direction)  there are also other vendors selling art jewelery and other pieces  my favorite was watching the man selling bread  he seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf  my fiance didn't get that from watching him but i could tell  we went over to buy some bread and he was in fact one of the most genuinely jolly people i've met - and i don't use the word "jolly" very often but it fits him perfectly  he had us smell the asiago loaf introduced us to the jalapeno cheddar and finally sold us on the rosemary with sea salt  it was $7 which i would normally think is ridiculous but for as often as i'll probably make it out here i bet i'll buy a loaf from him every time if he's around  the happy bread guy is worth the last star for me
1,this place totally love you can get a huge box of bananas for only 2$ pretty awesome
1,love the 3 p's produce people and prices this is the freshest produce i have found for really good prices and the people who work here always seem to have a good time   if the produce is in season the prices are just right  they also have a good selection of locally produced jams snacks and honey
1,if you don't live in the east valley it's worth the time and gas to buy your produce at the superstition market in mesa the prices are low and for the most part the quality is good today i got cranberries for $050 a pound sweet potatoes were $049 a pound and yellow onions just $039 a poundthe markets have weekly specials and prices are rarely what the supermarkets charge for fresh fruit and vegetables check them out and start saving on your family's food bills the staff is friendly and helpful we eat really well all year thanks to this market
1,prices great place to buy your produce good value but you have to use it quickly the produce doesn't keep for long
1,so it can take a little time to find the "best" -- and the produce generally isn't visually the best but the quality and price are still way way above anyplace else i also like that they have specialty items -- artisan breads jellies local honey -- and the prices still don't drive you away
1,love this place where else can you find clamshells of blueberries for $59 last week they had peaches for $69lb i always stock up and freeze what i canwatch what you grab because you can end up with some over ripe items but it's worth the couple of extra minutes for the excellent deals
1,really love the products and service i have received from boxed greens the unique and delicious produce is amazing and i love the fact that i can order it all over the phone and have it delivered to my front door they even carry my favorite cleaning supplies
1,is the way food should taste  i remember eating tomatoes right out of my grandmother's garden and the organic fruits and vegetables from boxed greens taste just as fresh  things from the store just are not the same or as healthy for you  the earl ybird option for us works great  like getting fresh milk "back in the olden days"  (not that i'm that old)  if there is ever a problem i can call them up and the friendly staff is willing to solve the problem right away you won't go wrong by making the healthy   choice by ordering from boxed greens
1,organic vegetables are fresh the staff is niceboxed greens is located north east of elliot and i 10 in tempe arizona  the entrance is located north of todd street on the east side of the building the entrance says grove commons  they need 24 hours notice for pick ups
1,115 degrees f outside and you've got burn marks on your butt from sitting on the leather seat in your car trying to make it to chinatown through the underpass as fast as you can there's traffic "damn tourists are everywhere" you mutter underneath your breath you think that waiting for the light to change at paradise underneath the monorail shade might just helpespecially since your ac went out the other day but the traffic pushes you just barely out of the shade and into the blazing noon sun you cry out in pain "dang this sucks" they keep saying it's a dry heatbut it still hurts solution you need a cool refreshing fruit slushy bobaand you need it fastas far as boba goesi prefer mine with fresh fruit i don't subscribe to the powdered mixes that some people prefer bc i find them far too saccharine even other boba shops that purport to make fresh fruit slushies make it far too sweet for my tastes if you're like me this non-descript unassuming little shop inside the chinatown plaza mall (just to the right 2 stores down from the entrance) makes some of the absolute best fresh fruit slushies with boba i've ever had in the bay area nyc houston and elsewhere - prolly a near perfect 10 for methe boba itself is done right - not too hard not too soft it comes a bit warm like all places which then melts the fruit slush a bit moretempering the sweetness even more they have an extensive menu choice for fresh fruit - mango watermelon etc (just look to the side shelf and you'll see all the fresh fruit they buy to make their creations) they even run seasonal specials - look for the signs near the counter my fave the watermelon with boba otherwise the kiwi or the honey dew melon are close seconds this is totally a mom & pop joint and not some bubble tea mecca like tea planet just a few doors down so not much space to sit inbut just order a couple and sit on the steps of the plaza near the entrance to cool off from that las vegas summer heator walk around and peruse the store next door for some pretty kitschy stuff - we once saw a belt buckle with the lv sign saying "welcome to fabdau las vegas" that's awesomei don't like their coffee or black tea versions of boba for that i'd go elsewhere (tp seems to be the best) but they do one thing better than those other places - cheap fresh fruit slushies that aren't too sweet 5 stars for the "no 1 boba" they're "fabdau"
1,buy my halloween pumpkins and christmas trees here every year (unless we go to the farm and chop them ourselves) i try to buy all my fresh produce here-it's cheap and good quality and local they also sell jamsjellies as well as other kitchen condiments nuts of all kind seasonal fresh produce farm produces such as milk cheeses eggs and some fresh meat they have seasonal flowers and plants for sale (think: mums and poinsettias this time of year; geraniums (and other flowers) and fresh herbs in the summerspring they also sell firewoodthe staff is super friendly they accept credit cards i couldn't say enough good things about hillbilly
1,love hillbilly market and come here for my local produce and meats i love supporting local agriculture even if it is a couple more bucks the prices are great i love getting their green tomatoes and grapefruits the grapefruits are the best i've found in the area this is the only place i have found green tomatoes for sale they also have a great selection of local meats including great affordable country ham i will continue to shop here for my various random wants and needs i can't wait to check out their summer selection of produce and plants
1,tomatoes locally grown and priced with that backyard vegetable garden taste  can't beat it  an array of seasonal fruits and produce as well plus jams jellies cider all sorts of pickled vegetables  give 'em a whirl  it's worth a trip
1,time i go in here they have great looking plants and flowers & excellent customer service i've been a regular for several years and always look forward to stopping by great place to shop local check it out
1,family has been going here since i was in pre-school and they have always had delicious apples fresh cider candles honey and raspberries plus they are family-owned and so friendly
1,went here today with my husband and kids  a lovely peaceful orchard with a nice variety of pick-your-own apples at a very reasonable price ($1 per pound as of today)  they also have an impressive variety of pre-picked apples inside the store including lots of interesting heirloom varieties (such as ashmead's kernel which i had never heard of until today but once i read the description i just couldn't leave without buying some)  they keep their website updated so that you know what's available that week  the grounds are well-kept and the family that owns the orchard was very friendly  i was bummed that they were all out of cider today but that gives me a reason to come back
1,i get sick i kind of get happy not because that means my diet will most likely consist of soup and ice cream since those are my sick comfort foods but because of carmel family physiciansi've been going here for the past 5yrs and could not be happier with the treatment i've gotten from bronchitis to strep throat to sinus infections to upper respiratory infections to food poisoning--they've helped me with almost everything under the sun they are located right near the cmc off 51 and 485 and have very convenient hours---i'm talking until 8p on weeknights plus saturday and sunday walk in hours in the past i've been able to call in for an appointment the same day which is pretty much unheard of at any doctor's office i've been to they have a number of doctors and physician assistants there clint price is awesome so see himnice staff recent magazines in and out within 20 minutes yeah i dig
1,doctor is jessica kaiser - she's one hell of a lady  they have a new online system that you can make appointments and ask for refills with which is very convenienti think she's the greatest md i've ever had :)
1,this place  friendly staff and techs  dr olulade is da bomb nice to have a primary that actually cares about you and makes you feel comfy 
1,much farther away from my work or home than my previous doctor in charlotte the extra drive to northwest family physicians is always worth it (if i leave on time and don't get caught behind any school buses on the way)  dr william larsen was recommended to me and i'm glad i switched my primary care to him  i receive such great care from dr larsen and i feel comfortable talking to him openly and honestly  best of all he doesn't rush in and out of the room  he takes the time to sit and listen to you to understand everything that may be affecting your current symptoms  the staff has always been great too  doctor appointments are usually last-minute things for me (because i'm dying or something) and they can always get me in when it's convenient for me  i appreciate that and that says a lot about their service
1,mean dr william larsen's place  not just so close to my house the staff are so friendly considerate and passionatei rarely visit doctors' office and hard to find a good one in charlotte nevertheless my previous insurance did not refer me to this place but gave me a couple that i had never had a treatment as i got lost in downtown or i could not find the placefour years ago my son got a physical for college entrance and we accidentally went to dr larsen's office  like themearly this year i had a serious chest infection got an appointment quick and had that fixed fast  then my boyfriend was referred by insurance to other place that he could hardly find  after checking he could go to dr larsen my boyfriend was so happy with their service i just got my physical quick appointment with no hassle and check up the following daygood place
1,leaving charlotte and dreading finding a new doctor because dr larsen has been a fantastic doctor for the past 2 years making an appointment is easy the staff is fantastic dr larsen takes his time and answers questions he's correctly addressed any medical issue i've had in addition if relevant for you he's lgbt-friendly (i found him on the gay and lesbian medical association) i can't speak to the abilities of the female doctor there whose name escapes me but larsen is gold
1,and very friendly staff the best in charlotte hands down
1,have been seeing dr larsen for more than 6 years  i can not begin to tell you how happy i am with his practice  i manage a medical practice of my own and belive me i know how difficult it can be to provice quality care and good customer service  the have accomplished it every visit  wait times are always a possiblity in a medical facility but they have never been an issue with dr larsen (usually 5-15 minutes)dr larson is extremely personal and professional  i never feel like a number with him or his staff  he has gone out of his way to make sure i've gotten the care i needed even when i had a lapse in insurance coverage  his office is 20 minutes from my home and 45 minutes from my work  i gladly drive there and will continue to do so
1,family physicians is the best  i have been going there for about 10 years or more incredible service all around   dr larsen is my favorite physician ever he is very personable friendly and professional - - and even in these fast times always takes time to listen intently to every concern (even if i have a list) without judgement - a model for all doctors to follow and live up to  he's very logical and thorough so i know there is no stone left unturned  and it's always clear during these discussions that he is up-to-date on the latest in medicine i moved to durham nc over a year ago and he's still my primary physician  wouldn't have it any other way  dr larsen's nurses are also great - friendly professional and very attentive (won't name names - don't want to miss anyone)
1,staff and doctor  i've been seeing dr larsen for years and trust his diagnosis
1,austin is incredibly thorough with pt and family history she personally spent a lot of time with me dr austin has awesome bedside manners and is very personable this is a small well run office staff is also personable dr austin is a stellar example of a great doctor i can't imagine that a patient would be turned away if they showed up in need without an appointment
1,austin is an amazing physician  she is compassionate caring and thorough  she is the only physician in her office which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you you will wait  but guess what one day that may be you--you may need that extra time  so i have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled  she has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future  if your treatment requires more specialized treatment she knows who and where to send you  as a middle aged man i purposely chose dr austin because she is smart compassionate listens thorough and has never once said "fully booked" when i've asked to see her for any reason that dayif you are looking for a great doctor dr austin is it 100%
1,never know how awesome a service or staff is until shit hits the fan and it's crunch time for this reason dr bauer and her assistant deserve way more than 5 stars and i owe everyone an update on this reviewi've had a handful of doctor's appointments over the past few weeks four of them with dr bauer not once have i had an issue and every single time there is nothing but helpfulness whenever i have to have yet another crazy unheard of test ran they've spent countless hours working on the paperwork i need to submit with all the results without appearing hassled or bothered they've also promptly called me when my results are in or for any other status update i requestadditionally they are very patient when my prescription company acts like an asshat due to circumstances i needed to have a 6 month fill of my prescription rather than the typical 3 month i receive when i emailed my prescription company they told me this was possible if the doctor's office called it in however my doctor's assistant tried several times and got nowhere today i was there with her and she patiently tried one last time and made sure my prescription went through as requested it was something that she really didn't need to do but kindly did for me despite how much of a pain in the ass it waswithout a doubt i recommend dr bauer and her assistant 110%
1,love my doctors  they are so respectful  i went in today with serious pain  my main doctor's partner saw me as my primary doc was out of town  she introduced herself asked me a lot of questions about my symptoms examined me and made several recommendations  surprisingly one of them was to see a chiropractor for an evaluation as the problem seemed to be with the muscles and bones of my ribcage  dr mansfield prescribed some low-key meds (ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer) and referred me to an awesome chiropractor right next door  i got the best night's sleep in recent memory and the pain seems to have decreased some already  the office staff is courteous and efficient  i hated to leave my old doctor who i'd seen for many years but she moved her office way out to southeast gilbert  mountain view is just a few miles from my office  i'm glad i made the change
1,doctor's office is amazing i always see dr collins but have seen others when i'm sick and she's booked not only are they speedy (10 minutes or less in waiting room) but the front office in general is very capable and helpful when any insurance issues have come up dr collins really cares about you as a person and your overall health and even calls with test results if it's anything out of the norm (or even if i was just a little worried about them)  she also is very personable and non judgmental when i tell her the truth about how many cocktails i indulge in on a weekend - although she continually tries to encourage me to stop having 6 cocktails on a friday night  i also feel like i can tell her the truth without feeling like i'm in the principal's office best part by far is when i didn't have health insurance for a few months between jobs they were super accommodating with my cash pay situation didn't rip me off and cared enough to tell me exactly where to go for cheaper med prices and weren't so far into in the drug companies pockets like most doctors to insist on pricey meds or name brand medicationsps dr collins doesn't accept new patients but if you call and ask her medical assistant they usually can fit you in
1,met with doctor mayy deadrick a few weeks ago and immediately felt at ease i can tell that she will be a wonderful family doctor best of all mountain view is home to several doctors so we should always be able to get in the same day or the day after we get sick the waiting room felt clean and comfortable too which is a big plus for any doctor's office
1,you're looking for a superb doctor who has a wonderful bedside manner look no further than dr dena cornelius she is one of the best most caring and thorough doctor i've ever had  she truly cares about her patients making time to talk to you about all your concerns  i can't say enough about her and highly recommend her
1,love this place i moved here 7 months ago and made an apt with dr mansfield she is awesome and so is her assistant  she's easy to talk to and will do anything to help i've been a few times and will return again and again
1,doc's office ever my primary care doc is dr mansfield and she is amazing as is her assistant i don't know what i'd do without them i've also been to other docs if i'm really sick and can't get in to see her and they've all been great the front desk staff is very friendly and quick with processing people through you never have to wait long with an appointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick but not so quick that you feel like you're just a number they listen to what you have to say and don't just give you meds for the sake of giving you meds which i love these guys rock
1,love this doctors office  dr mansfield is always willing to listen and is very compassionate  she is genuinely concerned about her patients and their health  whenever you have an urgent matter the office goes above and beyond to make sure you get to see a doctor immediately  i've been a patient here for about three years and am so glad to have found this doctor
1,bauer had great reviews and so did the facility so this is ultimately why i chose to come here i haven't had a primary in over 2 years i think and need a referral to an ent so i decided that i needed to develop a relationship with a dr and maintain it since i plan on being here for a whilethe facility is right down the street from my house so nice and convenient it is huge but they have a map at the entrance of the parking lot when you walk in you are immediately greeted by the girls at the front desk they promptly take your information and have you sign the remaining paperwork if you didn't finish it online you then wait for another lady to take your co-pay from what it seems this office runs like a well oiled machine but i thought it was interesting that the woman was copying the co-pays on paper in an old fashioned receipt book it didn't take long so i don't really care i just would have figured since they have online technology for their patients that they would have something for themselvesanyway a nurse came and got me and did the whole vitals thing and checked height and weight and what not and then i was placed in a room to wait for dr bauer it took her about 5 minutes and she was in and introducing herself reviewing my paperwork and talking to me about me she was really nice and straightforward which i liked - down to business please don't take it for her being impersonal because it isn't shes a busy doctor and wants to give you the best focus she can and i like thatshe checked me out and everything was fine as i knew and she also quickly gave me a referral for an ent in the same building and had me request my old records for a first time visit this only took 45 minutes which was less than i was expectingdr bauer and the staff are great and i hope when and if i need anything more serious i can prove them right even further as to how good they are hopefully that's not the case but i can already tell they will be awesome
1,shayna mansfield has been my primary care physician since i moved to the valley she has been outstanding as a doctor and very thorough in her approach with your health during several visits she asked me a multitude of questions as well as allowed me to be very open about what was going on she even said at one point "i don't know how do you feel you would like to go about it" humility is amazing and i am grateful i can have a conversation with her rather than being steamrolled like most other doctors who carry the "treat 'em and street 'em" mentality as for he office there was a little confusion with co pays with the office staff but no big deal bear in mind they are transitioning to emr so there is a little lag they accept blue cross blue shield so most things are covered waiting room is clean updated magazines fill most end tables parking is easy (i always get lucky with a front row spot) if you are looking for a great doctor then you should defiantly trust dr mansfield to give you the care you deserve
1,riley is such a nice change from my previous experiences with doctors  he is attentive takes his time to listen and even follows up with me personally to see how i am doing  when i went in to see him for mild chest pain which i believed to be heartburn he insisted that i be evaluated by a cardiologist the next day  after failing my stress test at the cardiologist's office due to a nearly 100% blockage of the main artery to my heart i was immediately sent to the hospital for emergency surgery  because of dr riley's serious approach to my symptoms and his staff's hard work at getting me into see a cardiologist as soon as possible i truly believe that i avoided a major heart attack or worse  i cannot thank him enough  in addition to being my trusted personal physician he was also my elderly parents' physician  he and his staff were always kind supportive and respectful to them  it seems difficult to find doctors today who genuinely show care and concern for patients both in the way that they treat them medically as well as personally  i have been fortunate to find that in dr riley
1,a family doctor can be difficult and i have been having a rough time doing so since my former doctor retired recently  the requirements i had were1  md2  office with one or two doctorsi hate when there are a bunch of people in the waiting room( especially gross sick ones ugh)3  friendly staff that actually returns calls4  doctor that doesn't make you feel rushed and listens to your issues5  easy to access not in a big building that is hard to park in6  available appointmentsdr riley is all these things and more  i'm  really happy with the ease and the great medical care  his nurses are good with needles as well  i had to get my blood taken and a few shots and she performed like a pro with confidenceso if you are in need of a new doctor i highly recommend dr riley  i think they also take most insurances as well
1,riley has been my doc for 6 or 7 years now  when i first went to his office i was confused  there weren't a ton of people in the waiting room  i didn't have to wait one hour in the waiting room and another hour in the room  as soon as dr riley walked in i started my "speed-recitation of current symptoms" - (this because my previous md actually would look at his watch and note the time - and then do it again at the end of the "consult") - dr riley listened calmly  i was confused again when he didn't just tell me i could pick up my prescription at the counter on my way out  he actually talked with me  he asked questions  he didn't make a mad dash for the door  miraculous  and the good news is that this has not changed in all these years  i don't have insurance so dr riley works with me on that  he and his wife the staff everyone is great in this little gem of an office  dr riley is a real family doctor - he is always there for you  what more could you possibly ask for
1,riley is very down to earth person who just happens to be really smart and have a medical degree  i'm usually pretty freaked out by doctors medical offices etc but i don't feel that way with dr riley - he is very calm and a good listener  his office is small and you can usually get an appointment the same day or next
1,riley is great i've only met with him twice but have found each appt very pleasant he's welcoming and easy to communicate within addition the ladies facilitating his office are kind and friendly; and have been very helpful during my past two visits
1,have been going to dr riley for a couple years and i would recommend him to anyone that wants a doctor that is very handles on he is always the one that sees you unlike some offices that have pa ect he always takes time to call me about my lab results i have always had great service and experience
1,i have been going to dr riley for almost a year i moved got new insurance and needed a new dr that was close as a new patient i was nervous how ever when i got there the front office ladies were very friendly and the dr spent about 30 min with me i had lots of questions and concerns about my health ( it had been sometime since i had seen a doc) i'm approaching 38 and preventive maintenance is now important i found dr riley on yelp i found all of the reviews helpful thank you to dr riley and all the staff at biltmore healthcare
1,seeing dr riley for years he recently moved to banner healthcare i like him he has called me at home a couple of times to check on me i was pretty ill but how often have you had that happen  he is a great doctor and a compassionate human being and he loves fly fishing
1,love love love this place  i switched from a previous office where the place always seemed to be a three ring circus  working together with dr oclair and kate montgomery feels like a team  this place is a well oiled machine  my most recent visit with kate montgomery was to go over some maintenance medication concerns over health conditions she had more familariaty with and the fact that i wanted to change and what our next steps were  we agreed on a change but would do it by making sure we had the information needed to make sure the proposed choice was a good one with some additional blood tests  she knew about the medication i wanted to switch to and provided me with well rounded information  unlike previous practices this office is not change adverse and after i explained why i wanted to change felt we were on the same page  this is easier said then done with most practices  the office is a bit of a drive for me in the mornings 45 minutes which is longer than i like but with the service received it is so worth it  also unlike my previous provider when receiving maintenance medications they provide at least 1 or 2 refills that way i'm not there additional times just to collect additional co-pays  i feel like an empowered patient thanks dr oclair and kate montgomery
1,was referred to fps by an emergency-care physician for an mcl injury i suffered in a fall i was seen by dr francyk who immediately went to work after an mri and other tests dr francyk refereed me to endurance rehab in phoenix the rest is history i've seen dr francyk and his nurse sara for more than a year now for wellness blood pressure and cholesterol issues the doctor and everyone at fps has been caring helpful and have gone the extra mile to see that i'm well taken care of
1,wyse is one of the most caring doctors i have ever had  he takes the time to listen vs just writing on a notepad  dr wyse follows up with you very quickly and actually cares he also goes over treatment options with you and explains options so you understand everything  i feel very lucky to have him as my doctori also want to note that carmen his nursepa is wonderful and give the same quality service as dr wyse
1,have went to dr francyk for the past few years  he is always professional honest and informative  i am never rushed and he answers all of my questions  he is a dr that takes his time and listens to you  i highly recommend him
1,o'clair is fabulous  she is smart caring and very knowledgable  i feel well cared for and listened to which is very rare to find i feel today  plus they have in house lab x-ray omt doc and much more  not to mention the organized friendly and helpful staff worth the admin fee every day of the week
1,manage an urgent care down the street and refer patients to this office frequently especially the new patients in town that have had the same doctor where they came from for 15 years and are looking for a new well rounded practice and knowledgeable team of doctors that they can trust  i call to get feedback from them about their experience just like i do when i refer patients to a certain orthopedic urologist ent imaging center ect  and all the responses i get are all pleasant  they like the idea of having x-ray and lab services on site unlike most pcp offices in the valley that have to send their patients to a different location to receive those services i have not been there myself so i cant give you a personal account but from the feedback that i get i never have any reservation in recommending dr wyse and his team of doctors and staff to any patient looking for a new pcp that doesn't treat you like a number and takes hisher time to address all your concerns
1,new signgraphic install here and the people were very friendly and accessible the office was busy the day we were there for this install which shows me they have a very thriving practice good to know in case i ever have to refer someone to a new doctor's office this one is in a nice businessmedicalprofessional park
1,is my all time favorite family practice - i have had terrible experiences in other practices but sobel family medicine will be my last stop super friendly staff and excellent pas you truly don't need to go anywhere else for your medical care they are available and accommodating to sick kids (and sick adults) they have always worked me in for same day appointments they have two physicians dr bruce sobel and dr larry sobel two brothers specializing in family practice they also have an on staff physical therapist audrey sobel recently a third brother joined dr jerry sobel he specializes in treatment and rehabilitation of disorders of the muscle nerves and joints he is a board certified physical medicine and rehabilitation doctor dr jerry sobel is very caring and direct with his patients he was very concerned about my long term prognosis and did not just throw pills at me basically the docs here care about the whole health of their patients and recommend all kinds of information on healthy living it is not a patient mill and i was very happy with the level of care
1,have been coming to this practice for years it is a true family practice however they are progressive and they do everything in-house they have their own x-rays labs chiropractor and physical therapy i have used almost all of their services without any complaints they are thorough and take the time to discuss all your needs i personal use dr becky the pa but i have also seen bruce
1,have been going to dr fauer for about 5 years now and i think he's great  he takes the time to actually talk to you about what's going on he doesn't rush in and do a 2 minute assessment
1,been going to dr fauer for over 25 years he is an amazing doctor he explains things well and takes time with his patients
1,fauer is in my lifetime - the best doctor i have had  i've never felt rushed or insignificant  this is the doctor that you want in your corner when something is wrong because he is like a sherlock holmes - he doesn't leave a stone unturned and is extremely thorough  he is very down to earth  i walk out feeling like i saw a doctor that "practices" exceptionally  his staff follows up in a timely manor with results as needed
1,have a new born and see dr berkowitz the staff has been great with placing me in an exam room right away so i do not have to wait in the lobby so far i am very happy here
1,found exactly what i needed in a dr here i had been a patient here for years before recently moving to oregon i saw dr rebecca morin and pa maura tardis they both were extremely caring and had the best bedside manner i truly felt that they listened to me and wanted to do what was in my best interest regardless of the reason for my visit maura is one of the sweetest funniest and talented women you will ever meet the gals in the office are just as great they could always get me in no matter how quick the notice was i will really miss this practice now that i am out of state
1,is my local "home" gym  great routes that are changed frequently challenging lead routes and a large bouldering area the staff is very friendly always around for questions and safety nazi's which is good since they are always on top of the scary newbie belayer's members only nights are tuesday and thursday this can be a very crowded time is it because the men can climb shirtless hmmm the weekend can also be a crowded time due to the many kids birthday parties they hold there but with as many routes as they have finding a good route is no prob the gym also has a decent fitness area with personal trainers and even offer free yoga nights to its members lots of great members perks in factall in all i love this gym the only thing i think they could improve upon is offering more classes especially lead climb classes maybe some clinics toorock on
1,came here as a beginner and was a member for almost a year until i moved farther south  the staff was very helpful both at the front desk and out on the floor  someone was always walking around and if they saw you were on a route and having trouble with your next move they would offer technique tips to help  they are also around for safety and are quick to correct anyone not being safewhich i liked as a beginner and learner  the routes are a good mix for beginnners to advanced climbers and they have a bouldering area as well  member's nights are great as you don't have as many beginners and it's fun to watch the really good climbers in action  it can get busy on weekends with birthday parties and teenagers running around but i knew those times and tried to avoid them  equipment is available to rent including shoes and they also have a little shop with some items for sale  i like how they've added some yoga and other classes and have a weight room and some treadmills upstairs to use  a great place
1,like to climb things i've learned  this place is a tad bit far me but totally worth the drive  looks fun - is fun looks hard - is hard :) i know you're not supposed to use your arms much while climbing but damn when you're up that high you can't help but be a little afraid of falling  thus clinching for dear life  needless to say my arms are sore :( this would be a great family gathering but also if you're looking for a good workout with a twist - it's a must  thumbs way up
1,on the rocks is an awesome place i went about a month ago and had a blast the people there are so friendly and helpful i cant wait to go back with my friends loved it )
1,have been to this gym twice now and i am really starting to get into climbing i love their high ball bouldering problems and the super high walls for top rope another thing that makes azonr a great place to climb is because you can also do a solid work out afterwards with a full gym on the second floor i can be a little crowded in the summer time but i guess that's to be expected
1,2 reasons i originally went to azr were 1) my hubby (bf  the time) was way into climbing so we started climbing together and 2) one of my good friends works there (idk if he still does but he worked there forever)  i was immediately hooked on climbing azr is a great place for kid parties and team building (they probably have at least one kid birthday party every weekend)  they have plenty of bouldering and trad routes for people of all skill levels they even have lead climbing (and classes to teach you lead climbing if you don't know howwhich i don't haha)  the staff is super cool here and we got on a first name basis with them they are always friendly and helpful (and fun to hang out with lol)  i also loved the free yoga classes for gym members with jeanette  i miss this place so much after moving away
1,hadn't been to the climbing gym in years and it was time to start back  went on saturday and had a blast; varied routes fun bouldering helpful staff and a few automatic belays in case your partner wants to check something else out while you go up a route  seriously considering purchasing a membership  my forearms are still sore
1,am incredibly impressed with this place and i will go out of my way to go to phoenix when the rock climbing bug hitsi've been climbing a couple of times but only belaying my kids this time i jumped in as a climber for a few reasons: 1 my awesome gts workouts prepared me strength wise 2 they have several auto-belays so both my kids and i could climb individually 3 for an indoor climbing gym it's cheapwe hardly ever go to rocks and ropes in tucson because it's so pricey not only do you have to pay the entry fee but the equipment rental is separate so for a family of 4 you're breaking the bank not that way at az on the rocks they have a special for a family of 4 $45 plus tax that's it no equipment rental fees and it's all day what a deal  we ended up spending about 4 or 5 hours there and had an absolute blasttheir registration and safety intro procedures are simple well done and easy to understand the staff is really on the ball when it comes to scanning the gym and the climbers to make sure everyone is doing it right there are a multitude of climbing levels and walls as well as a large bouldering areaon the second level they have an entire gym with treadmills elliptical machines and free weights that you're more than welcome to use along with all that they offer yoga classes and morei cannot wait to get back to az on the rocks thank you for making my first climbing experience an a+ i'm officially addicted
1,place to go climbing for first timers there's a mandatory video - not too bad fairly short as a first timer they were friendly and patient with teaching all the basics nice staff and nice rocks good times free climb on your birthday good stuff
1,climbing gym  many routes of all difficulties and a variety of auto-belay routes for people like me who show up without climbing buddies  would highly recommend
1,our trip to phoenix my daughter wanted to go rock climbing  after researching we headed over to peoria and went apeapart from the facilities which were great i really noted how helpful the staff was here  with their help and advice (and not to mention great instruction on how to belay) my wife and i were able to encourage our daughter to make it all the way to the top of the climbing face  it was a great fun experience for all of usyes we will be returning here on our next trip to phoenix  it's a great place for beginners to learn how to climb
1,first rock climbing experience was at ape index  the staff was really helpful and made sure i was comfortable before i was sent off to start climbing  the gym had lots of different routes  i was able to go up a bunch of different routes and challenge myself  after going to another rock climbing gym i really appreciated how many different routes they had for beginners (that were not so simple that i felt like it wasn't worth my time) and for the advanced
1,had a blast rock climbing here my 11 year old son had so much fun that he asked to return for a few more climbs after dinner  we had an all-day pass so why not we'll be back the next time we visit family in the area
1,the staff was super helpful on my first trip out and i wound up climbing for 4 hours that night i may not invest in a full-blown membership yet (climbing for one day had me sore for a week) but i'll definitely swing by on ladies' night (wednesday) for half-priced climbing
1,is the only rock climbing gym i've been to so my review might be a bit biased  the gym itself is very nice  a bunch of walls with all kinds of paths to take  i usually grab on to whatever rock i can reach  the next time i go i will try sticking to paths  they recently created a bouldering wall on the second level but that is only available to members  they do have a small bouldering section in the back corner that is available to everyone  a lot of the walls climbs require two people  one person that is climbing and the other is belaying  if you go in by yourself you're kind of limited to the auto-belay climbs (i believe there are 4) and the bouldering section  the overall price for rental and day pass is around $17-20  if you do plan on going there more than twice in a month i highly suggest you sign up for their membership which is $35 and you can go as many times you want through out the month  plus you get access to the upstairs bouldering room
1,place is the best gym in phoenix area a lot of great nice climbers willing to help you figure out routes or belay youmore fun to climb with a friend unless you boulder the staff is great i got a membership first day and plan to keep it up as a regular sport bouldering is a little difficult for beginners but you get better faster ask for some help and you'll be on your way
1,place is awesome for me it's about human interaction and the staff there are very nice and helpful the guy that helped us seemed very excited to be there and his attitude was contagious everyone there is relaxed and knowledgeable the walls provide a lot of options for beginners like my group safety is also important they train and go over things before you go to the wall
1,index has heart and soul  it is a community of people who are so encouraging and supportive  the routes change constantly so that there are always new things to try in fact i would say about 25% of the gym has changed since january  there are some signs up that say prices will be raised starting in april so it is my suggestion that you try to check it out before then  there are ways to get "locked in" to the old price if you like it there    climbing in general has really changed my life a lot  it has giving me a place with positive influences to blow off steam after a really hard day  not that i was going to the pub a lot but it has kind of replaced the pub for me  i do hope over time a few more auto belays are added otherwise it is perfect
1,place is really awesome no other gym in the valley has such a welcoming atmosphere and both the staff and the regulars are extremely friendly helpful and supportive the routes are constantly changing and evolving and i feel like theres always something new fun and challenging to test myself on this is the place to be  to develop personal growth and you'll always have a sincere group of people to help you on your path it earns my highest recommendation
1,place to climb i love that there is a place to climb in the west valley they just repainted and it looks really cool a lot of fun routes to be found here
1,was the most educational and fun activity on our trip to arizona our guide caleb was incredibly knowledgeable about all things climbing we will use them every time we visit arizona or their other  locations when traveling we laughed climbed and learned a lot at one point i became a little overwhelmed with the height and caleb safely quickly verbally guided me down to where they were waiting at the bottom an amazing kind and very cost effective company
1,have always wanted to try rock climbing and finally had the opportunity w stoneman had an absolutely great time with my instructor todd he had all the gear & was a great instructor i would highly recommend contacting them if you're interested in getting out there 5 stars all the way
1,husband and i just got into rock climbing and were thrilled at the opportunity to try it for a second time in az caleb was an awesome guide and went beyond the two hour time we signed up for because he was willing to show us new types of climbs while explaining the technical skills and techniques as we went along now my husband is hooked on "crack" climbing all of the gear was provided and we enjoyed spending the morning with caleb we'll definitely be coming back to climb with him the next time we are in the area
1,family and i were visiting az over the holidays and love to do group activities i called up caleb and he helped us set up a group trip for 9 of us he and hugo showed up with all the equipment we needed and were excellent teachers our group ranged in age and skill level and they adapted to our needs ontop of that they were a lot of fun and our group had a great time with them i would recommend them to anyone - very knowledgeable affordable and you feel you are in good hands with them
1,family had an amazing time with caleb and hugo they were very helpful instructive and patient with our large group they made sure everyone had an awesome time
1,comparison to the two other climbing gyms in town (r2c2 and ncc)pros: *tons of bouldering routes from v0-vcan'tbelievehowhardthatis with slab overhung really overhung and upside down even when the gym is crowded there are still plenty of spaces to climb*the routes change regularly*the work out area is a real work out area (running biking eliptical and rowing machines that have plenty of space kettlebells dumbells barbells pull up bars etc)*a shower changing rooms lockers shoe cubbies super clean bathrooms*yoga classes*incredibly professional staff who wear staff shirts and actively monitor the gymcons:*a drink vending machine and snack vending machine but limited options and cash only*more expensive (day pass is $17 while rrcc is $15 and ncc is $14 adult eft monthly membership is $64 while rrcc and ncc are $50)
1,gym friendly atmosphere great routes  problemsi stopped by for a climb while on vacation and i couldn't be happier with the decision here are some reasons why you should climb here:problems  walls: beginner - expert throughout the gymmost gyms reserve the overhangs and slanted walls for more difficult problems but refuge has bigger holds throughout the gym so you can still have fun on seemingly difficult problems at only a v2-v3 levelstaff:justin gave me some beta on a few routes that i would have never figured out and the owner jeff actually worked one-on-one with me providing advice on climbing technique the two tremendously helped me advance the way i approach a problemgym:in addition to clean holds and new mats refuge also has clean bathrooms water fountains cubbies couches changing rooms lockers yoga room and a complete traditional gym - they have it allfinal word: i wish this gym was in my neighborhood my local gym doesn't chalk up (duh-duhn--tshh)
1,i first heard there was going to be a new bouldering gym in las vegas my initial thoughts were "coolnot going to be a good place to train maybe check it out when it rains and the sandstone is soaked"then i came into the refuge and my mind was thoroughly changedto call this place a climbing gym is to use a misnomer it truly is a training facility  the  offerings of fitness and yoga incorporated with very good route setting really helps push this place to what las vegas has long neededwithin a week of opening the number of local hardmen and hardwomen i have seen frequenting this place reinforced what i had already suspected:  this place is awesomeit has a very open feel to it the walls are quite tall and downclimbing is an essential skill here if you value your kneesankles  staff is fantastic as noted above and most of the time they are wearing staff shirts  most climbing gyms i have been to i haven't been able to tolerate the 'bro' mentality and condescension many of the staff members have that is absent herei agree that it is a bummer that vending machines are the only fooddrink options other than water here also would be nice if they sold a few things like chalk and tapebut that is truly nit pickingthe owner is very active in the gym as is his manager and both are very receptive to and often solicit feedback  now if only i could get stronger so i could climb some of those v-thatisreallyfreakinghard problems
1,found this through groupon it is an awesome brand new place to climb it's clean and the staff is very nice and helpful it's mainly bouldering which is a technique of climbing without ropes they do have one wall that you can use ropes but this is mainly used for birthday party's so if you want to use ropes you should call ahead there is also a small place to stretch and work out before you start if you just want to sit and watch they have 2 huge couches that you can relax on
1,have raced at vlk a few times and i enjoy it more and more every time if your goal is to achieve a personal course record make a memorable event for a family member or have a corporate team building event vlk is the perfect place
1,place to have a corporate event  they have a brand new restaurant and bar too the staff is great recommend you check them out
1,iti know nothing about go karting cars engines but my boyfriend who loves stuff like that brought me here for date night we came around 10:45pm on friday night they had a running special so the boyfriend paid full price and my cost of entry was only $5 the workers were extremely helpful since we came so late we were the only people there (excluding the group at the food area) so we had the track for ourselves one thing i really like is that you sign up and register upon entry and they automatically send you your race times and place number to your email along with giving you a print out i had the best date night ever coming here
1,colleague and i are traveling across the states working for a rock n roll touring act and we have been going to many karting courses victory lane is by far our most favorite we make it a priority to come here every time we are near charlotte  the course is awesome and the karts are insanely fast these are gas powered not electric so much better the staff is incredibly knowledgable and their kitchen made us specialty food items we had such an awesome experience here and we will definitely be back soon if we lived nearby we'd be here multiple nights a week
1,with some work friends on business great timeit's nice to smell the fumes and rubber and to race with a real engine i've raced at k1 speed and it doesn't beat the gas engines and the price of this place (maybe 10 bucks cheaper per race on avg) the jumpsuits and track size and config combined with the above make a great experience for adultsi also like their idea of membership if you wanna get competitive or come more often didn't seem the same at k1 when i went back homehighly recommended
1,the owner during a wakeboard session down in charlotte this past weekend and with the rain that came in sunday decided it was a perfect chance to go check out his establishment until the weather cleared up a bit5 starsemployees were on top of things pricing was right on the money (buy 2 races get 1 free) and the carts were fast enough for the track layout to keep things interesting  tons of fun and i would definitely be in a league or similar if i was a locali've been to a few other indoor karting facilities across the country and victory lane is at the top of the food chain
1,is a great place for rental karting the staff is typically pleasant and friendly to deal with with the recent addition of a new fleet of karts things are top notchkeep up to date with the website and they always have leagues running as well as 12 and 24 hour special eventsyou bring the money they provide the helmet firesuit and kart and along comes the entertainmentrecently along came the introduction of pit road bar & grill they have a vast variety of legendary bar food and cold flowing adult beverages most of the barkeeps are friendly and easy to deal with
1,here for a company event everyone had a great time the staff was on point & had fun personalities the bar was great & the bartenders were awesome i liked that if your not into racing go karts there are games such as corn hole foosball and ping pong there are huge glass windows so that you can sit anywhere inside and watch the races
1,loves fun at f1 race factory fun is their focus safety is their mo i came here in the fall of '06 for a work function it was a team-building day so while we did have to meet in a room and "talk shop" the people at f1 made it very comfortable and easy we met in their big room (with couches high tables and ample space) for our meetings breaks were then infused with team fun we actually got to split into groups and challenge each other - see who could be the fastest team to change 4 tires on a real (thought retired) race car my team placed 2nd it was great we got to do a practice run and then two real runs to let our lowest time qualify f1 was sure to have snacks and beverages handy after (and before) in case we worked up an appetite during the day lunch was served here too tasty hamburgers made to order after our meetings we got to go on the track beforehand we sat through a brief safety video and explanation then we were fitted for helmets and shown to where the action happens i was nervous i had never driven a go-kart before and these were suppose to be the fastest in-door go-karts in arizona uhm yeah let's just say i had no idea what i was doing nobody explained the pedals to me so i just assumed they ran like a car i was right i took off not really knowing how many laps i had to do or where i was going there were friendly guys out on the track to wave flags - for "wreck" ahead slow down or even get out of the way of speed-devils behind ya (i got the latter quite a bit) at the very last of the race somebody sped by me to place ahead of me that means i placed last that's okay it was my first time out there and while i spun my car around once or twice - and ran into the sides several times - i was just happy to be alive to make the race fun f1 gave us awards for 1st 2nd and 3rd i won an award too - for being the turtle on the track that was funny all in all i had a great time while i would probably not go to back to race i'd go back to watch people race or hang out in the "cafeteria" area playing arcade games or munching on food this is definitively  a fun place to send your thrill-seeking speed junkie friends you can get gift cards too
1,rocks so much to do prices are reasonable for what you get service is great
1,was great i had a blast here the run down it was my birthday and i walk in and went to these computer to sigh in  we had a room set aside for us with some food and the n we race some of us race on the road some of us did not have licenses and other have not had there car for a long time  so if you8 have a big event come up make it this onn
1,place is best on grand prix night they open the whole track 
1,place is awesome membership is well worth it good job guys
1,cars i hoped for less sharp turns to hit them faster use a coupon or you will get charged high prices for one lap long wait check in first then go somewher else while you wait
1,a bunch of other reviewers i experienced f1 race factory as part of a conference related team building activity for work "team building" is usually code for "i'd rather poke sharp pencils in my eyeballs" but this was a big exception lots of fun and the staff was awesome in accommodating our grouphighly recommended
1,a blast at this spot ( and not just because i whooped my bf's ass either on the trackbhahaha)anywho we signed up and became members cheaper to do it that way if you think you will get the urge to race often member is $14 and some change and non member is $20 you sign up pick a racing name that will permanently been yours forever and eva ( sexyspeeder right here :) ) you get a head sock you will have to wear under the helmet free t-shirt if you sign up also  ladies wear closed toe shoes i had to borrow some of there's and lets just say i never want to wear rental shoes againyou can race as much as you want take breaks in between or do back to back if you choose on sundays they combine the tracks together so its an even longer track it was really fun those little karts go pretty fast ( and they do take bumping very seriouslythey will pull your grown ass over and scold you like a little kid if they catch youi know cause they gave my bf a talkin too) they keep track of your best lap and which place you came in and you get a paper that records all this my 1 is plastered on the refrigerator whoop whoopif your looking for some competitive fun try this place out they also have food drinks rock wall and arcade also also might be a cool spot to throw a kids b-day party alsovroom-vroom
1,had a groupon with some work buddies we went on a weeknightmuch better option as during our 3 races there were only maybe 5 total racers which lends itself to way more "going fast" i'm sure it gets a heckuva lot busier on the weekends i'm glad we had the groupon for the 3 races because the normal pricing seemed a bit steep but it's all glammed out for the nascar in all of us you watch a short video donn a head sock and helmet and out you go the carts are super fast (much faster than the rinky-dink ones we had as a kid) braking and sliding is just so much fun remember thoughit's not bumber cars they will flag and remove you from the course if you blatantly or continually bump other drivers because it does hurti got t-boned by one of my work buddies and my back was sore for a week afterwards they serve beer and some basic bar food there's a small game room (think 80's arcade) and the staff although didn't seem to be too enthralled about being at work were helpful we have several more groupons for this place and can't wait to go back
1,place puts a smile on my faceear to ear baby  so much fun i knew about this place for awhile i remember hearing carl edwards talk about it on the radio one time years ago with my brother and dad visiting from out-of-state about three weeks ago i suggested we check it out what a great decision f1 is not your typical go-kart amusement park let's take a couple of spins around the track and be on our way it is probably that x100 i'm pretty sure the karts got up to 30-35mph the slipping and sliding and constant fishtailing makes for a kick ass ride  seriously it's a great time you won't be disappointed  the only negative i could understand people having is that the prices are kind of steep i would recommend to check out the website which often include coupons and other offers and memberships  (also check the website for their calendar of events they do have different track options for different days and they do have league races which could cause conflict) me personally don't mind paying the money for this type of entertainment it was a blast brought me back to my teenage days i will definitely check out f1 again
1,attended the 4-day racing school and "loved it"for "anyone" that wants to learn the limits of "any car" in "any situation" the bondurant courses will teach you what you need to learnbefore i attended bondurant i had experience racing cars however hands downif you your family member (who mabie a panicky driver) teenage driveranyone would benefit from the courses at bonduranteven the intro to racingthe instructors i found to be very helpful and i got the feeling that any of them would be confident teaching 'anyone' how to drive and how to handle a carin which heshe can then translate the skills learned to any car on the roadit has been about 6 years since i completed the course and it is still memorable for meand will definitely go back when i have the money to race again        thank you bondurant for having a wonderful school with positive knowledgable and helpful instructors
1,highly recommend taking this course it may be expensive but it's hard to put a price on driving skills that could save your life or the lives of your friendsfamilies for how much time we all spend in cars it sure doesn't hurt to have superior command of your vehiclei learned a lot in my course for example i learned about weighting the individual tires of my car particularly through a turn i also got experience steering out of a "black spin" sure the odds of getting into a situation like this are low but i like to think that i will remain calm and return my vehicle to safety should i ever find myself in this position also it's fun i still think of bondurant skills today -- years after taking the course -- and hope that i can do the program again in another 10 years or so highly recommend
1,at bondurant is not a goof-off play-time joke there is serious classroom time to learn serious theory early starts long days and thorough testingi have done other high performance  advanced driving courses before but this was by far the most technical and demandingi did a 4 day course which i think cost about $5000 (someone else paid) based on what i can do in a car now that feels like a bargain the most valuable improvement in my driving is a much more heightened awareness of vehicle dynamics i can "feel" the weight distribution of my vehicle change now as i change speed and direction after driving the bondurant vehicles mine feels like a boat but i can drive it a lot better and if i ever have to do a reverse 180 at 40 miles an hour no problem also you meet really cool people in the course
1,husband was able to go here for an experience  he absolutely loved it  i hung out on the sideslines and watched him have a great time  it made me nervous how fast he was going and he was even having a hard time catching his equalibrium when he was finished  he'd go back again in a heart beat
1,took the 4-day grand prix road racing course and really the best way to put phrase this is "you don't know what you don't know"  i thought i knew what i was doing but i really didn't  however i didn't know that  they broke me down and built me back up with all of the correct methods  i can't say enough for the program and the instructorsif you have questions as to how good they actually are go to the corvette forums and ready the reviews that people have given them from real corvette owners and aficionadosi will be back
1,was lucky enough to come here with a large group of friends and family members to race corvettes and go-karts i have loved corvettes for a long time and this was the first time i got to actually ride in one but hello i got to drive it as well what an experience i felt like danica patrick the go-karts were a little more scary but maybe i just had too much competition yea that's it i was one of two girls and there were like 10 guys with us but it seriously was such a fun day if you get a chance to go don't hesitate hit the gas pedal and go
1,n's review covers the details very well for the 4 day grand prix course so i won't retype them one thing i will add is that the drills in the first two days are applicable to both the rest of the course and street driving so they are definitely worth the time spent on themfrom my experience with the heat on the track don't hesitate to take a break when you need one there is plenty of seat time in the coursefrom the moment you walk in until the moment you leave everyone is professional and relaxed to make sure you have a good time and learn all you can  thanks to brennan instructors william and robert marissa at the desk and of course bob bondurant for executing a great week for me and the rest of our class
1,school of high performance driving - 5 stars: while it has been some time since i was here i felt it really deserved a review this was a great experience i worked at a company where we tried to have something special to do each year with the senior people - sort of a team building project that could also be lots of fun  we chose bondurant racing school one year while programs and cars change at the bondurant school from time to time when we went it was all ford and we took the 2-day grand prix specialty course our introduction was the same as others have mentionedwe arrived at the 15-turn track and the first thing the instructor does after saving hello is put us in an unassuming 15-seat passenger van to drive around the track and see what we would be learning for the two daysor so he said we put on our seatbelts and then he drove us around pretty fastsloshing us from side to side on the seats (memo to file - don't spend the previous night getting loaded in celebration for the first day because you will need all your senses)and then he drove it again at his top end to show us how fast one can drive if they are in control  what a great intro to the course now we had our challenge for the two day event we spent a half-day in the classroom learning the physics of high performance driving - where to enter a turnwhen to brakewhen to get off and on the acceleratorthe handling differences between front-wheel drive cars and rear-wheel drive machines then it was out to the skid track to feel the physics - the instructor used the outriders (lifters) on a car to lift different corners at high speed - the challenge was to see how fast you could do circles or figure-eights before losing control we did this together and then one by one with the instructor - so we had a lot of personal one-on-one time (memo to file - dramamine)  after that we went to a slalom course where it started as a single lane and split into a y - each one controlled with a stop light at the start of the course we were invited to see how much wheel spin we could generate on starting - in fact they egged us on and of course with high performance tires on it was hard to get much spinbut it did get our speed up for this lesson on the y strip the challenge here was to approach the lights as fast as possible and slam on the brakes at a marked point and steer the car into the lane with the green light - which did not appear until the last second the lesson was that you can steer a car even when in a full abs brake lockupsomething you really don't know until you try it end of day oneday two was mostly on the 15-turn road course we strapped on our cars and went out one by one with the instructor again - for a little personal time the first time around the course after each had done this we each had the chance to have the course to ourselves and see how fast we could get around with no competition after that our group was given access to race each other (you can buy insurance to pay for any damage you cause) we had been given the course rules beforehand so racing against each other was a lot of fun and not dangerous this was probably the most fun - the chance to put into practice all we had learned so far we ended the day with the opportunity to drive open-wheeled cars on the skills track and then on the road course the difference between the two types of race cars was amazing and fun to try getting in the open-wheeled cars is a bit claustrophobic inasmuch as you wear a helmet with facemask in this equipment and the cockpit is a tight fit the bondurant school is expensive (from $500 to $5000 per person depending on lessons and days) but tons of fun it is a great event to do with a group just make sure you like the smell of oil and exhaust and spinning tiresburning rubber - this is a racing enterprise and all the smells you'll run into constantly remind you of it but it was a singular experience to be able to rip the tires off a car and drive all out great lessons in safety and how to drive fast and safely
1,took the 4 day grand prix racing program excellent serious racing preparation race theory and car control are taught in the classroom and drilled into you on the track you perform repetitive exercises to learn heeltoe sifting emergency race avoidance maneuvers and apex exercises official races were held between our group where we had to react correctly to the flags thrown the instructors are racers and very good they rate your performance daily 80% of my time was spent on the track in the car lot's of seat timea couple guys brought their personal rides (ferrari aston martin) and worked a deal to take them on the track awesome i stayed at the fantastic sheraton wild horse pass resort & spa right across the street from the racetrackmy driving skills increased dramatically and it was the best time i've ever had highly recommended
1,did the 2 day grand prix class and while i wish there had been more time on track the experience was awesome the skills learned in all of the drills will stay with me forever and that's what's important the instructors are great - very patient and don't rush you at all they want you to improve your skills and will not make you feel like an idiot if you don't get it right away
1,the strip is a great place for kids to put pedal to the metal  one kart track for the little ones two for older kids and one for over 16  looks as if they hold a number of kids' b-day parties here but don't pay that no mind because the action is outdoors  look in the what's on mag (available for free in hotels) for a coupon worth 1 free ride if you buy 2   you'll need a rental car to get here because it's about 15 minutes from the strip
1,was nice that this place was a venue that participated with the las vegas power pass  being on vacation i like finding deals that keep me on a budget especially with 2 children the power pass included 2 ride tickets 6 tokens a personal sized 1 topping pizza and a small drink because we had multiple days on the power pass it resets at midnight and you can do it all over again  my kids loved it so much that we went 2 nights in a row  it saved me on dinner both nights since it came with food  the pizza was pretty good cheese was gooey and the crust wasn't soggy the kids loved racing each other on the tracks and it lasted a while too  definitely coming here again on our next vacation
1,i've lived in las vegas for about 10 years now and have been to the las vegas mini gran prix a bunch of times i enjoy taking my kids and out of town guests out to ride and play in the arcade it's a fun place on weekends with the buzz from all the activity i had some friends in town last weekend and they wanted to do something "non-strip" related as they had been doing all of the shows and attractions i suggested the lvmgp and we had a blast my friends loved the place and we landed up spending about 4 hours there just goofing around and acting like kids they have an awesome automated cotton candy machine that you have to tryi though we were going to be there for a an hour tops but we landed up being there until about dinner time we worked up a bit of an appetite and after looking at the menu thought we'd give it a shot listen las vegas mini gran prix has an awesome menu if there is a category for "the tastiest least greasy pizza i've ever had i'd vote lvmgp tops their 16" large 1 topping pizza is killer and at only $499 with a text in dealit's even more yummy they have baked chicken wings and bbq ribs that are out of this world tender juicy wow honestly i never expected such great quality to come from behind that counter it's a hidden secret and i recommend it it took me 10 years to finally taste their selectionif you want to have a great time have some fun food and just act like a kid for a few hours las vegas mini gran prix is a great way to go i suggest using their text-in program as they have some good coupons text "lvmgp" to 62411 for updated weekly specials you can also find them on-line at wwwmobilecouponscom
1,karts and rollercoaster for kids yay yummy pizza and i think $5 large deal during the week  def go
1,were looking for go karts in las vegas for our trip since we had our 2 young boys with us it was difficult to find a 2 seater go kart or one they can drive themselves i was searching the internet and came upon this place it was only 15 minutes away from the strip not bad at all we went on a wednesday early afternoon so it was totally empty they have this cool little photobooth in the middle where you can take free pictures and post them on your facebookthey had go karts especially for kids my boys had a blast then all the way in the back they have the adult go karts which my husband and sister in law loved it was so much fun they have other little rides as well
1,you're looking for a fun clean well maintained entertainment center with arcade games food rides and four different racetrack course - this is it  we had an awesome time with the sprint cars the go karts and the arcade games  my son had a minor issue that required attention by the counter staff and they were incredibly kind accommodating and understanding  thank you lvmgp staff for a great time  we'll be back
1,we had so much fun
1,bought the 1hr pass for 20$ and ended up buying 3 more because intense racing and pride of not losing kept me and my brother racing over and over again if a adult it's a must to race on the adult carts there a blast and fast
1,family had a great time they have 4 racing tracks the cars can go pretty fast the people we were racing with were competitive and i love a competitive spirit we will come back next time we visit las vegas plus the pizza was cheap and tasted pretty good
1,times kids have fun adults have a blast unless you're there with kids
1,your inner-racer here you get to suit up (optional) and wear a neckbrace and helmet (a must-do) and cause all kinds of havoc on this track although bumping is not allowed bumping is for less-skilled drivers anyhow you're just here to race and test your skills against competition and that just adds to the fun you're timed all the way down to your fastest and slowest laps and given a standings sheet after each race it can be a bit tiring toward the end but it is a good workout and you'll wanna experience the adrenaline rush again it was in all honesty--the best time i had in vegas
1,shit  i really wasn't expecting much from this place based on their relatively simple track set up  i went with four friends in the midst of a bachelor party and could not have had more fun  my only other karting experiences have been at speed ring (now closed) and gokartracer  the differences  1) racing suits optional (ditched after the first session) it makes for less fatiguing racing and you know who everyone else is instantly  2) superb ventilation  four humongous fans on one end of the track four opposing roll up garage doors partially open  3) well-tuned vehicles  despite the huge and ungainly gas tanks in between the drivers' legs the carts accelerated and handled flawlessly  i'm sure the rear located engine helped with the fairly neutral handling   although having driven 3 different cars each car had their unique set of handling quirks  4) bumping  we weren't paranoid about getting kicked out after the initial bump  in fact when we proved that we knew what we were doing (we didn't bump anyone into an unrecoverable crash) they let us drive the last one unattendedunsupervisedyou know you're having fun when you don't want to be the driver out in front
1,had the greatest time at fast lap the customer service here is excellent because we had a group of eight a shuttle was conveniently sent to pick us up at our hotel after filling out some waivers and watching a short instructional video the fun really started we got to wear racing suits they're optional but it's so much more fun to wear them and get in that racing spirit add your head sock gloves neck brace and helmet and you're ready to go racing for $62 per person we got three 15-lap heats the first two were fast lap qualifying heats the final heat was a full fledged race with a traditional 3-2-1 race start the karts were by far the fastest i've driven at a place like this it was such an adrenaline rush being out there chasing down cars in front of you and trying to pass them after each race printouts are provided showing lap-by-lap times and other helpful racing stats when we were all done the shuttle had just arrived to take us back to our hotel i cannot wait to go again
1, $1250 per person no taxes no extra anything since when can you get a whole race (10 minutes) for that price in the bay area granted that it's vegas and we went on a monday the track was basically empty except for another couple there we watched a one minute rule of safety and had the option of putting on the jumpsuit but seriously who in their right minds would want to put on stinky jumpsuits which were worn and probably not washed on a consistent basis eitherthe track was simple but fun enough where there were curves which prevented you from going too fast (well for me at least) maybe it's the off-strip of vegas but everything is cheaper than it is in the bay areafor those of you who are sick of the strip and the smoke and don't want to do anything that's "typical vegas" but want to get your adrenaline pumping this is the place to go
1,is by far the best go-kart track in vegas  gas powered karts - not electric ones like the other tracks - give you that real racing feel  they are much faster than the track so you really have to drive  you can't just floor it all the way around the course like at the kiddie cart tracks - this place is for adults who want to act like kids for a while not snot-nosed toddlersstaff is always helpful and friendly track is perfect for all skill levels (not too easy or too difficult) and it's a great bang for your buck  just about anytime i have friends or family visiting me in vegas and they ask to do something non-traditional (ie not gamble get trashed hit the strip clubs or spend hours throwing food down our throats at a buffet) i take them to fast-lap  not once has anyone i've taken not been thoroughly impressed and had a great time  it's a blast - try it
1,took my boyfriend here on a surprise date he had no idea where we were going because the place is located on paradise right before the road turns into a dead end once we turned into the parking lot he said "fast lap oh my god we're going to fast lap my friends at work have been telling me about this place this is awesome"we walked in and were greeted by a woman at the front desk we showed her our voucher for 2 races for 2 people and she had us each fill out a waiver (that's when you know things are about to get intense) then she brought us to the back room where we had to watch a short video on safety precautions and fast lap rules after we were finished with that we put our belongings in a little locker and suited up in some kickass jumpsuits i was pleasantly surprised to see they had one that wasn't ginormous on me seeing as i am under 5ft once we were suited up we went to the racing area got on our helmets and gloves and waited to be called up for our first race there was no one else there at the time so it was just don and i that got called up we were given neck collars for added protection and two carts were assigned to us i was glad they didn't have me get into a junior sized cart since i didn't reach the 60in requirement for an adult sized cart (maybe they just assumed i wasn't that short) but they did have to put two pillows on my chair so i could reach the pedals once we took off on the lap don immediately zoomed off far ahead of me i guess i'm too much of a paranoid driver to really race here but i enjoyed going through all the twists and turns of the track even though don overlapped me like 3 times literally i didn't even keep track of how many times we went around the lap but it seemed like it lasted 10 minutes or so the second time we got on the track there were about four other people racing as well we all took off and i pretty much stayed 4th place the entire time i didn't really enjoy the race with that many people as much as i did with just don and i because i felt like i was at high risk for crashing into someone else so i never really tried to pass anyone up don said he preferred the race with that many people though because it was a challenge i guess that tells you who's more ballsy between the two of us all in all i love this place the staff is very accommodating and knowledgeable the track is entertaining the place is very clean and the experience is exhilarating i highly recommend you check this place out there seems to be a lot of great deals for this place going on right now on different websites so get them while they're still available because you won't be disappointed they definitely accommodate your needs here
1,was my second visit to fast lap this year and they definitely did not disappointpros:    open late (until 11 pm) most of the week  friendly staff  quick carts   cons:  very hot (temperature hot)  helmet visors need are all scratched    so i took my girlfriend's brother here for his birthday and it was super dead  i was surprised considering it was a saturday evening  i could have sworn it was going to be packed (totally wrong we were the only ones there)  i had purchased 2 races for each of us  since we were the only one there the worker running the track gave us the option to do one 20 minute run or the typical two runs at 10 minutes a piece  he recommended doing the 20 minute run as it would allow to master all the turns and give us a chance to conquer the track  i figured that it was an awesome opportunity to do so and that's what we did  he ended up beating the first half of the race but i finished in first at the end  info & tips:   if you have never been to fast lap be prepared by bringing your driver's license and to fill out a waiver prior to starting  the next step is watching a 2 minute safety video  it's a little cheesy but your attention is needed  after doing so i recommend you use the restroom if need be  you don't want to suit up then have to use the restroom 2 minutes before race time  i love dressing up  i think it's part of the experience  suit up in your choice of red or black  after going through the second set of doors you have other safety gear to put on(not in this order ha):  helmet head sock neck brace and racing gloves (optional just like the race suit)    don't forget to pick up your paper which tracks your best time fastest lap top speed etc etc  keep it for bragging rights and take a picture with it on the podium (you'll see the podium)    totally awesome  more so if they had helmets with visors that weren't scratched  if you have your own helmet you may bring that one  don't forget to check out the photo wall in the office and see what celebs have raced the tracks of fast lap  i'd most definitely recommend this place  even though it's family fun i wouldn't recommend it for younger kids  i could see how it could be dangerousand don't think that you are too old to have fun at fast lap  that's nonsense and a tell-tale sign that you are probably scared to put the petal to the metal
1,love this place even down to the cheesy race suits they make you wearever wonder what it felt like to go 50mph around an indoor track and drift on a go kart well then this is the place for youi went with around 8pm on a thursday night there was a bachelor party there so there was about 10 of us on the track but it was a blast racing complete strangers the staff here is wonderful you have to watch a safety video and suit up in race suits they also provide you with a neck brace and helmet must try
1,place has really fast karts much faster than the one i did in daytona 0_0 i got the groupon deal for 2 ppl 3 races per person for $49 what a deal had to wait about 15 hrs though because everyone was using their grouponsbefore my race i witnessed some kid crashing into the first sharp turn & he flew into the air & hit the pole his helmet flew off & he fked up his kart damn that kid did not put on his helmet correctly & he accelerated instead of braking on the turn he also looked too tall for the kart he was pretty tall after seeing that i was always scared of the first turn while all the other turns i was recklessafter my first race my hands were numb i was more reckless the first time the second race i rammed a guy [who then had problems wit his kart bc of me] & i started smelling gas so i was scared i'd blow up this place is awesome except for the long wait i'd def do this again
1,super fast and fun
1,like most family fun places but seems to have a lot more it had miniature golf batting cages go karts bumper boats arcade games *and* sandbeach volleyball and a driving range the best part the automatic tees that come up with your ball and the fact the balls load themselves no more carrying around a bucket for the truly lazy ;) overall it seemed pretty clean as well  i didn't eat there so i can't say much on the food
1,my kids awhile ago and loved it
1,this place is so much fun we came here for a round of mini-golf and we all had such a great timewe chose the optical illusion course and it was definitely challenging but all in all so much fun next time i want to try the bungee bounce and go to the batting cagesthis is such a fun place to bring the family friends or a date
1,and affordable took my 4 year old nephew here to ride the "fast race cars" and he loved it the go cart track is fun as can be and the 2 person go carts even had a second "steering wheel" that he could pretend to use (other go carts don't always have the second wheel and he is very serious about steering) anywhoo we also did the bumper boats and those were just as damn fun wait times in line were nil and prices are cheap i highly recommend this place can't wait to go again
1,love crackerjax because it is super fun i had a strong desire to go to some batting cages because for some reason i used to go a lot as a kid when i was living in az plus why wouldn't you like it or maybe i'm just weird but from not even handling a bat in almost 10 years i wasn't half bad i apparently was so good that this little 5 yr old boy started watching me called his dad over to watch told me how impressed he was and then gave me a high five um awesome definitely the highlight of the evening it's kind of sad that i felt so happy about a little kid giving me a high five but hey it was pretty cool we also decided to do the bumper boats and the go karts my bf got my mom and her bf to do the go karts with us which she wouldn't usually do super fun i was scared to do it since i haven't even driven a car in 6 years but it was soooo much fun we ended up doing it 4 more times
1,have a driving range obsession  the two floor range is amazing not to mention the bottom floor automatically replaces the ball after you hit it i always come here on a day off
1,family had an awesome afternoon riding the go-carts over and over with the four hour pass but the best part was the staff who helped us find our keys which we had lost in the go-carts the manager dawn rae had her crew spend an hour searching the under carriage of 20 cars and eventually found our keys she went above and beyond and saved us so much money & stress and salvaged our vacation  thank you
1,is great for kids; big and small  my son and i started off in the batting cages where you have a range of cages to chose from: 35mph to 70mph  we were visiting the area to attend sf giants spring training so we used their bats and helmets  not the best equipment but did the job  $150 for 18 balls is a great deal from where we are from so we had no complaints  next we were off to the go-karts  another tremendous value  they have armbands you can purchase for unlimited rides of the go-karts bumper boats and mini-golf for $25 (weekends) but we settled on the $650 single ride ticket  they give you about 10 minutes of unbridled go-kart fun  the arcade does have older style arcade games but we didn't have any problems with the basketball game skeeball football game or the jump rope game that kept us busy for an hour until we left for lunch  we didn't have time to walk over to the golf driving range otherwise we'd probably could have easily spent another hour or two at the facility  they have something for everyone
1,boyfriend and i came here on a thursday night around 8:30 pm for a spur-of-the-moment date night and i couldn't have been more impressed the prices were very reasonable and the entire place was a lot of fun we paid for the unlimited wristbands (which you can get a coupon for making them $15 ea) which gives you unlimited access to the bumper boats mini golf and racetrack for four hours we were there for only 15 hours until the park closed and we made our money back x2 considering the prices for each of the attractions alone we went around the racetrack i believe 5 or 6 times played an entire 18 holes of mini golf and went on the bumper boats overall we had a great time and we will be back
1,kids love this place they both had birthday parties here and the kids had a blast i thought the parties were reasonable priced go karts for big and smaller kids miniature golf batting cages bumper boats arcades are just some of the things they offer
1, just moved to las vegas and i am a big racing fan  in the past month i have visted three racetracks (mini grand prix fast lap and pole position)  the grand prix is more of a kids place but fun if you are under 10  fast lap was a dump i could not even stand to stay and race as it felt like it was over 100 degrees in the building and the exhaust smell made me dizzy   i also went to pole position which was very cool  the cars are electric and the place is air conditioned so that alone made me stay  i did go on a saturday and they were very busy i had to wait for 45 minutes to race but it was worth the wait the carts are  fast  the building is like a museum with all kinds of racing memorbailia very well done  the day before i was there i read that george lucas was there if it is good enough for the creator of star wars then it is perfect for me  go to pole position
1,go-karting at high speeds   they give a full print out of your success  you can gauge best lap progress over the 12 lap race etcgood in a large groupi did 48 laps and wanted moredafe
1,5 off for hard ass tiresthis is awesome - i've never been gokarting unless you count mariokartlet me tell you this is nothing like mariokart these things go somewhere around 60mph and my best time around a 14 mile track was 1:27 yes minute and 27 seconds whoosliding out is easy to do with their hard tires but seriously - this requires relinquishing all fears and pushing your driving skills to the extreme there is seriously very little riskif you're a speed junkie like me you have to do this btw with a group it's 70 bucks you get use of the lounge (and their wii) a t-shirt free drink and 2 times around plus you get to race your friends we were there for a bachelor party and had 13 people
1,experience of indoor carting with a bit of technology to boot  really impressed with the timed racing and a fairly comprehensive printout for each racer at the end of each race to see how you compare to each other as well as those who have raced that particular week  really an awesome experience and highly recommend if have transportation to get to this place
1,isn't your traditional go karting venue  pole position go karts are  go-karts on steroids  you have fast electric cars helmets and timed laps  the driving is so serious that you have to watch a video and sign a waiver before they'll let you onto the track  this place is awesome  by far the best go karting experience i have ever had
1,fun the acceleration is great great to go with bunch of friends the only caveat is that it's a bit pricey and the race is a bit too shortbut you must go there seriously it's a great racing experience
1,place is just about worth the $30 for your very first time you enter a username that you'll use every time after you can input any driver name you want so don't put something boring like  your name you can name yourself anything i've seen "beatbyagirl" and "the stig" nice before you hit the track they make you watch a safety instructional video it's very brief don't worry and then seven minutes of fury the carts go pretty fast i've heard they peak at 45 mph but depending on the configuration of the track (they do change it up) you may or may not be able to hit 45 the speed of the carts is also governed by remote control just in case some one wipes out and the employees need to slow or stop the race i really liked the printout they give you after your race you're ranked against the other drivers in your race and against every other driver that's raced at any pole position location after you've registered every time you race it keeps a tally of your score for every visit it makes you want to keep trying to raise your overall score and improve your heatsign up for their email notifications -- they are not in excess and being that the price of a regular is a little high it helps to stay up to date on the specials there are some people that go to pp that are no joke they look down on people just wanting to have fun  they are on a mission and i get that
1,load of fun just remember to not drink too much the night before
1,was my first time doing in-door go karting and i'm definitely going to do this again  went there on a saturday night around 8pm - staff was friendly raced right away and the karts were surprisingly quick  super fun
1,friendliest staff at both locations in the las vegas area  i always find time to go to pole position when i'm in las vegaswish it wasn't soo busy all the time but that just means they are doing something rightmy favorite races are the team endurance races  i travel to pole position just to do the memorial day 500 lap race every year
1,on a date with my girlfriend and had a blastpole position has faster cars than the usual ones at family fun center places  the facility is clean and the staff is friendlyi really enjoyed the real time lap times on the jumbo tron so that i could monitor my racing but the thing that really got me excited was the post race analysis  as you leave the pit you are handed a score sheet that shows off your lap times and charts your progressa 15 lap race is about $25  we got the 2 races and a t shirt combo for $45i would do this again
1,went here for my older brothers 30th birthday we had no idea what to expect but were completely sold on this place by the time it was over the staff was on point the cars were fast and gnarly the prices were just right and they even threw in a free race with a text message i'm definitely going back
1,go there with my friends in a group to race and like how they can put us all together and not only that like how they time each lap and have the final print out sheet at the end with your time compared to your friends and everyone who laps the top times of the month highly recommend
1,a great time racing go karts but even better at pole position raceway
1,was one of our bachelor party weekend activities that i can actually write about initially we went to the other location which is much nearer to the strip but they were swamped there and it would have taken 3 hours to finish our 3 races that we wanted to purchase luckily and fortunately for time purposes and on our wallets we happened to be able to drive to this location there was no wait in fact the whole raceway belonged to us that being a group of 7 guys the price quote for the 3 race package at the arville location was for 70 but here it was for $60 which comes out to 20 per race word to the wise it's cheaper here per racethe track was great and everything went without a hitch the gokarts are electronically controlled and racing suits were not required only thing required were the provided rapist masks and helmets we got shirts at the end of the race also my only warning is after racing while driving i felt like i could drift and do all kinds of crazy things but luckily i didn't for the safety of my fellow brothers
1,this place every time i go  extremely fun  best go kart place in town
1,like this location better than the one by the strip  it is cleaner and the staff is nicer  more for locals so no surprise
1,place is definitely hidden in the corner but it was great all the same the staff is super friendly and the actual racing was so much fun once you get the hang of it there is no stopping you a little pricey but still a great place to come every once in a while
1,girls (ages 8 and 10) attended a summer camp session here  they loved it  the younger one started out very tentative and the people there worked with her and she was able to become much more comfortable and confident in the kart (and cut her time in half)  the played games drove the karts and just had an overall great time  wonderful way to spend a few days in the summer  i hope they do some on the kids school holidays  we will be back for sure
1,been coming to this gurudwara for almost a year and a half now i never knew they were on yelp i hope it's not bad karma to rate your religious center so here's hopin' for those of you who may not know this is the holy center for those of us of the sikh faith you do not have to be sikh to visit anyone is welcome (there's free food) the only thing is you must cover your head and take off your shoes i'm happy to have found this gurudwara in las vegas
1,it wasn't for yelp i would never knew that there is a gurudwara sahib in las vegas area beautiful building and open to all regardless of gender and race i uploaded few pictures i hope you guys like them  this place is 20-25 minutes away from las vegas strip there is another sikh temple which is very close to the las vegas airport
1,am planning to visit this place on 3rd week of september 2014 when coming to las vegas for company meetings
1,moving here from californiai assumed that there are no south indian temples in az  i was proved wrong the temple is new all main deities and good priestsworth visiting if you are in sun valley
1,powerful positive energy i was  fortunate to get blessings from satya narayan ji who was visiting from udupi  mangalore  india 
1,am south indian hindu brahmin by background  i go regularly to this tempe and pay my respects  please note that you must wear full trousers if you visit here  they do enforce it  this is a good temple to attend
1,nice and quiet temple  priests are very good and accommodating if you have pooja at home this is the best place to bring the priest from you don't have to pick and drop them they will drive and come only disadvantage is that it's too far from phoenix
1,great temple built along traditional lines  has a quiet and meditative feel upon arrival  very engaged group of people attend and everyone is welcome  the only downside is that it is far from the valley -- but definitely worth the trip
1,gurudwara sahib is only 10-15 minutes away from las vegas strip and 5 minutes away from the airport the head priest was really nice and offered us refreshments there is another sikh temple "gurudwara baba deep singh" which is 30 minutes away
1,when i always do when i go to this ice cream shop the oldies playing and the best and biggest ice cream in pgh the large ice cream cone comes out the side door cause they can't fit out the windowwow it's great and has been great for many many years been going there since i was a young young lad i'm now 27 and take my family there we love it keep up the good work
1,is by far the best soft serve ice cream place in southwestern pa the "flavor of the week" is always interesting-and tasty though i am somewhat disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk for their vanilla and chocolate offerings i don't know if this is a matter of cutting corners or if the better stuff simply isn't available any longer either way this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of dq tastee freeze etc it's definitely worth the trip it's mostly street parking though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side serving sizes are huge the small cone here is the same size as a dq large and the large is so big they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side doorif you want a real "kodak moment"-order a large cone for the kids and keep the camera and wet wipes handy
1,favorite ice cream place in pittsburgh they have over a dozen varieties of soft serve caramel coconut peach pineapple peanut butter and i can never decide which to get they're all yummy i've never tried the food but who cares it's all about the soft serve
1,best place for an artic swirl :)
1,love this place more than any other place ever before in the history of places and me eating at themnot only is the ice cream made from local heroesturner dairy but the man who operates this fine establishment chuck page is one of the friendliest people in pittsburghthere are so many options i hate to say i've gotten the same thing more than twice a couple of faves:thin mint artic swirlcoffee ice cream with chocolate sprinklessouthside shake(sundae on top of a milkshake) best ever
1,grew up in baldwin so as a kid the family and i would always frequent this place often the best ice cream around i have to agree the arctic swirl is the best around i suggest you try the chocolate covered pretzel yumm-o good prices and fantastic people working there
1,love little soft serve places like this  the ice cream here gets an a+  i had my classic--small vanilla cone dipped in rainbow sprinkles  people were talking about their family memories from when they'd eaten here in summers past in line--i'm not from the area but it seems to be somewhat of an institution  just on our first stop we saw families of all ages couples bikerseveryone can enjoy this place  definitely stop by if you're headed to the south side
1,been coming to page's since i was a kid and at 25 i still get that "yay ice cream" feeling when i go here  their soft serve ice cream is great and their hawaiian iceslushes come in several different flavors  the dips on their ice cream cones are very good and very popular as well  however my favorite thing to get their is their artic swirls which also come in distinct and fun flavors (i really enjoy the banana cream pie)  did i mention the great prices and friendly staff  this place has been a staple of the south hills and it never fails to attract a large crowd of people  you can't go wrong with page's
1,is one of the places we miss the most since moving from pittsburgh we visit every time we are here during its open months though a visit a few weeks ago was just as good as ever i adore their southside shakes (half shake half sundae) their homemade ice cream cookies rock as well and i love that they put plastic covers with a lip on their ice cream cones helps keep little (and big) hands clean while enjoying a cone prices can't be beat the line moves fast and everyone is always friendly will be back the next time we visit for sure
1,my absolute love for sweets - and more specifically ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in pittsburgh to go to page dairy mart the only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live so i can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof nowas you walk up it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine in fact you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu odds are they'll just smile and run off to make it i mean if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream what don't they have rightthe people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent it is cash only so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town don't worry though usually the line isn't actually long at all they take your order quickly at page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to page dairy mart's army of ice cream servers on staff that "line" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appearsa night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and i haven't wanted to go back only our conscious willpower has kept us away and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way so kudos to page dairy mart and their staff heck it's snowing today and i'm probably going to go
1,historical unique affordable efficiently run pittsburgh gem
1,and i have taken to driving up carson street to get to the southside in order to avoid that horrendous traffic in squirrel hill  we drove by page dairy mart a few times and each time he would casually mention that he would like to go there somedaywell we didi wish i could comment on one of the delicious looking sundaes but i'm watching what i eat soooo frozen yogurt it waswhat i can say is that the yogurt was smooth and creamy and i love that they have a ton of flavors they can "mix into" the yogurt so you can get almost any flavor you want  hubby had a cone of regular soft serve ice cream and said it was really yummy  he also had an order of cheese sticks and said they were just ok so we will probably stick to ice creamfrozen yogurt from this placethe kids working were fast and friendly so we left them a nice tip  as someone who worked her way through college working at a frozen yogurt shop i can say -- tip your servers even if just your change -- they will greatly appreciate it  :-)
1,ordering from them since the early 90's always hot and fresh  best white pizza i ever had hoagie's are great burgers with curly fries with cheese is always a favorite sometimes they don't answer the phone for what ever reason but when they do its great
1,noone's reviewd scoops this place is the ultimate hangout young and old alike the prices are average the flavors are plentiful and the staff is always friendly (always a plus on my list) it's a few blocks from my house and i remember on hot summer days grabbing my sisters yelling upstairs to our parents "we're going to scoops"  and walking up there we'd taste the flavors we were trying to decide over (they give you little spoons to do this) and then we'd pick there's also an assortment of frozen yogurt sorbet milkshakes toppings candy and sodas too after paying we'd take our cones outside and sit on the steps chatting well into dusk many people come here all year round everyone in the neighborhood knows each other and you're bound to run into someone you knowgreat place for ice cream and making memories
1, closest one that was open since the greentree location on noble roman's was closed  the entry and exit are a tad precarious but well worth the dairy queen goodness  if you aren't familiar with the area make certain you bring your gps or you will get lost  good service and great ice cream
1,was the most amazing (and authentic) ice cream parlor i have ever been too  really it gets the biggest points for being authentic  the decor is old-school 1920s style: wood paneled booths old telephone cubbies a beautiful marble ice cream bar and bar stools with the seats shaped like soda caps  the walls are lined with glass drug store display cases - now filled with an assortment of glass ware and interesting ice cream parlor related paraphernalia i heard about klavon's first while watching a wqed special on the strip district  when the special was filmed the second generation of owners (the son and wife of the founders) had recently passed away the parlor stayed closed for a few years according to my fiance so when i decided after the hot summer day that scorched pittsburgh yesterday meant an ice cream run the fiance immediately had me check the hours for klavon's i was greatly surprised to find out that their summer hours go till 9:00pm on sundays yay - we had enough time to get there and enjoy the ice creamthe place was packed with i would guess around 20 to 30 people awaiting or enjoying their ice cream the ops are so efficient it didn't take long for them to whip up an extremely delicious sunday called the "chocolate delight" so for atmosphere service and a amazing ice cream sunday - check out klavon's
1,place is a must  i don't live in pittsburgh anymore but visit often throughout the year and go often when i'm in town  i'm a native pittsburgher and i didn't even know about them until well after college  now i'm hooked  they have a penny candy section  remember the penny candy stores that used to dot pittsburgh's neighborhoods i hadn't thought of those in years until i stepped into klavon's  it does that to you it takes you back you'll understand what i mean the minute you're there  the owners and the people who work there are so wonderful you'll want to go back and backthe ice cream is delicious and they have the best homemade ( i think) whipped cream  i often get amaretto and it is scrumptious  you can have jimmies sprinkles caramel nuts etc  the atmosphere will kill you and the story behind the place is really interesting  look it up or have them tell you  it is authentic old pittsburgh  you won't be disappointed if you go here  it's an experience and a wonderful one  i can't say enough positive things about itthey have a small parking lot behind the building  it's not that far away from the lively part of the strip district  a nice afternoon would be shopping for produce down the street and walking up to klavon's for a treat
1,shakes and ice cream and candy and food and the decor
1,first heard about this place (or saw it) on one of the rick sebak wqed documentaries about pittsburgh (which btw you should watch them all - they are fantastic)  in the program the place was old and run down and waiting to be remodeled  he then did an update to that doc in which it wa reopened  when i saw this i had to gothis place it amazing  the only classic soda fountain ice cream shop i know of  it is soooo cool  classic style soda fountain vintage hard to find candy  the decor is just greati totally admire the owner for getting this place together and reopening it
1,stopped in at klavon's last weekend for the first time i stopped in around 8pm and even though it seemed like the neighborhood was deserted klavon's was packed very popular spot  if you are on the strip in pgh you have to check this place out taking a step into klavon's is like taking a step back in time this place was originally an old drugstore soda fountain from the 1920's the inside is all original complete with 3 old telephone booths stained glass windows beautiful counter top fancy chrome soda fountains and several glass display cases displaying items from times past stop in here for a quick lunch and a shake or an ice cream cone or share a $20 super bowl sundae with friends if you dare ;)
1,just happened to wander in after an afternoon of exploring pittsburgh  what a gem  what a lucky place to stumble inklavon's was a drugstoresoda fountain in the early 1900s  all the original counters glass cases filled with old bottles stools and mixers are still there  we had the turtle sundae with amaretto whipped cream which was amazing  i can't wait to come back and try their phosphates and egg creams  it was like stepping into a time machine you can tell this place is beloved by locals; several elderly couples families with children and single people with dogs on leash came by for cones sundaes and floats on the beautiful sunny day  the grandson of the original owners was chatting with customers and the place had a really special vibeyou almost never see places like this anymore - if you're in pittsburgh don't miss it
1,of history at this place  once a drug store now an ice cream parlor  be sure to read the interesting story of this place and check out the flood line when you visit  you can also sign their guest book while you're therethe guys working here were extremely nice  they were very patient while i perused their extensive menu  they offer all sorts of ice cream creations such as floats sundaes splits and milkshakes  they even offer no sugar added and lactose-free options as well as flavored whipped cream  in the end i decided on a single scoop of ice cream in a cone - how boring
1,stars for the ice cream 5 stars for the experiencebooths tables counter with stools plenty of seating in this old time ice cream parlor filled with history run by the family of the grand parents who first opened the place as a pharmacy in 1923personable service with a dash of humorthey serve hershey's ice cream which has been operating out of harrisbugh since 1926 (and has nothing to do with the chocolate company)hershey's ice cream has a smooth creamy texture with good flavor  nice place to visit when in the strip district
1,place to go on a date cheap and super cute
1,i die i hope i come back as an ice cream bowl at klavon's so i can forever spend my days covered in mint chocolate chip and watching people smile i don't knowmaybe not but i do love mint chocolate chip and old skool ice cream parlors and klavon's does both really well this is a list of things at klavon's that make me feel like vintage stuff isn't only for grandparents and ice cream isn't just for kids: amaretto flavored whipped cream swivel stools with red tops high backed wooden booths a man behind the counter with a pure white handlebar mustache a hammered tin ceiling and large pecan ballsyou can go with chocolate or vanilla but when i get the chance to have a pecan ball i'm no idiot i take it a pecan ball my friend is ice cream rolled in pecans covered in hot fudge or caramel and then topped with whipped cream that's all tasty nutty fudgy goodness but if you wake up feeling like painting the town gold and you want something that tastes like it was made for cleopatra by mark antony's own hands get a scoop of coffee a scoop of pecan and top it with amaretto whipped cream: i'm hoping to get this added to the menu under the name "magic magic explosion" they have a picture of joe biden posing with the owners; it's taped to the mirror behind the bar and quite adorable "he was very nice and left $20 for the next little girl in line to buy her ice cream with" the owner told me  also $20 worth of ice cream two scoops only runs five bucks joe biden--excuse me mr biden--you are a true american hero and i for one am happy someone finally realized the importance of children having tons and tons and tons of ice cream good show sir good show
1,think it may be a crime to give fewer than five stars to twisters  seriously they're awesome  their soft-serve (try half chocolate half vanilla) is probably the best on the planet and they offer homemade ice cream sandwiches  everything is affordable so you can easily feed your frozen dessert addiction  on hot days or heck even on lukewarm days this is the place to be
1,have awesome soft serve home made ice cream sandwiches  i look forward to the time when twisters reopens after the winter  they are cheap friends and most importantly delicious  make sure you get ice cream sandwiches to go because after you finish one you'll want another one
1,beauty of living directly next to twisters is that well i have an unlimited supply of frozen goodies right in my backyard literallyi only get the chocolate vanilla swirl for myself and a small scoop of sugar free vanilla ice cream for the puppythe ladies that work there during the summer are always super nicenothing to ever complain about here
1,has great coffee and a great atmosphere its cozy and has a european vibe there is outdoor seating and the noise level is just right; quiet enough to get work done loud enough to obscure conversations the crowd is diverse - groups of locals internationals and people of all ages but everyone is friendly and down to earth if you are new to the area i highly recommend it it is a progressive coffee shop where people sip their coffee and enjoy it a refreshing escape from the typical grind ;)
1,fan  first time i have ever been to this place and the milkshake i got was delicious  my mother also got a frozen coffee and i think i wound up drinking all of it for herthe cookies that were there also were great  i am not sure whether they cooked them there fresh or not but they were delicious  defiantly the best stop my mother and i had while we were on walnut street and i would venture back to the place in a secondps the wait staff was also very pleasant and kind
1,favorite coffee shop on walnut st  most of the folks in there are regulars who greet each ohter by name  i did my job search there this winter so i was in daily and i too got to know everyone therethe coffee is great the staff is friendly and they have free wireless  one day i couldn't get the wireless to work and the guy who does their it just happened to be in the shop and not only did he set my wireless up for me (which he didn't have to do) he also fixed my computer which he really didn't have to dothis place has a warm friendly welcoming environment and is a lot quieter that hte coffee tree  it is my fave coffee shop the also serve ice cream and have outdoor seating which is perfect for summertime
1,is by far my favorite place to get coffee ever if you are a student or maybe a recent graduate in need of internet this is the place to go grab a coffee and grab a seat inside or outside and enjoy using the internet as long as you like no time limit
1,staff quick and accurate service great tasting coffee and free wifi umm what else do you need  i avoid the other coffee spots on walnut either because the staff ain't so hot or it's always jam-packed  jitters is cozy and clean check it out if you need a quiet little place to work or study  the baked stuff always smells delicious but i have yet to indulge
1,recommend - ravi and the staff are the best in shadyside
1,coffee is solid--better than coffee tree roasters imo--and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed prefer this place over the local chains any day
1,just served me the creamiest chocolaty-iest chocolate ice cream i've had in like foreverworking out of our charlotte location this week i missed my office's cookie wednesdaybut not to cry bc this location has ice cream wednesdaysstopped by the previous morning to stock up on water & the lady was super-friendly  she chatted up my coworker (he was a local) and there were yummy looking bagels & pastries - prepackaged but still looked yummyso when this super-decadent ultra-creamy ice cream is given to me one bite was all it took for me to be in luv  others got strawberry & vanilla & i gotta say that strawberry looked homemade w its huge hunks of fresh berriesthen i'm told it came from the very same place i'd been to just the day beforemy coworker also said they make a mean milkshake  will totally be back
1,love a place where you can get a sandwich on a toasted "everything" bagel  halfpenny's is my jam when i just want a bagel sandwich and some chips and maybe a yogurt  the staff is super duper awesome and i always seem to catch myself in the elevator with the owners and their family they are so cute  this is a great "quick fix" lunch place and i've heard from co-workers that the breakfast stuff is pretty good too  all around solid choice for me
1,delicious fresh coffee  i'm not talking about the stale cup of plain joe you get at any other regular coffee shop that tastes like dirty burned coffee beans  if your office doesn't have a coffee maker i highly suggest making a trip down here  if you're concerned about the preparation - it's regular old drip coffee not percolator so do with that information what you willa medium java sets you back only $170 and they have a ton of flavored coffees if you're into that  normally i'm not but i tried the "hawaiian macadamia nut" today and alohaaaaa delicious  you can't really beat it for a cheap and good quality cuppa  (*side note* there is a $3 minimum for credit cards so bring cash if you're coming down for just coffee)
1,is my spot for coffee and bagels each day ice cream is also fantastic they remember what i order and i get my bagel and coffee in about 3 minutes service doesn't get any better than here
1,has been my go-to spot for lunch for years frankly dollar-for-dollar it is the best value in charlotte for that quick inexpensive grab-and-go lunch especially for those who eat out on a regular basis and just need food i have tried to find other places to get sandwiches (often more expensive) but the value isn't there i'd rather pay $5 at halfpennys than $8 at some other flashy joint or chain just a better deal better quality better service try the egg salad sandwich i haven't found it's equal moreover it has been consistently good since i found this place 10 years ago and if you have room get yourself a chocolate malt by far the best malt i've ever had
1,honest food at a fair price made by cheerful folk i've been going there for years and am rarely disappointed
1,i can't believe it's taken me this long to brag about my favorite nail saloni've only been going here for like14 years they are always sweet reasonable clean quick and up to date on all the latest nail colors and trends
1,went here because i wanted to try a new salon and i'm glad i did there was no wait time and the staff was very warm and friendly i had a pedi and a full set both look beautiful it was $25 for a full set with gel and $21 for the pedi i highly recommend central nail
1,there for the first time today and left impressed $30 for a mani pedi and the salon was clean and the staff was friendly i was looking for lincoln park after dark in their opi selection and found a bottle of the color that was almost empty and when i asked if it would still be ok to pickuse the bottle they promptly came up with a fresh new bottle i picked a light pink shade for my mani and hanna warned me it was very light and suggested another option but i insisted after the color was on i found out what she meantthe color was very transparent transparency in color doesn't bother me but i thought it was nice that she tried to help while she was doing my mani and asking a few friendly questions hanna discovered i was on my lunch break once she found out that information she asked how long i still had and made sure i was out on time even with her being sensitive to my time constraints i left with a great mani pedi that doesn't look rushed all in all a great find i think i've finally found my nail salon of choice in central phx thank goodness
1,visitor despite living in the neighborhood forever what a hidden gem walked right in no wait (ok it was monday before lunch) and the manicurists were so sweet and pleasant not a massive collection of colors but i found exactly what i wanted they did a beautiful job (standard pedicure for $18) with a nice long pumice-stone scrub-down and i noticed the technician cleaning the basin directly afterward lovely employees good hygiene and an impeccable pedicure at such a good price central nails will be my new go-to pedi place
1,clean great work on my pedicure  i found this place on yelp (of course) and i sat in the chair looking around trying to figure out why it was different  first i noticed that all the customers seemed to know all the workers and vice versa  maybe it was just a nice neighborhood i thought  i eventually got to talking with the person doing my pedi kim  i told her i found the place on yelp  and i read her the reviews - so i asked who hannah was - "over there" she said  "she's my sister"  "in fact we're all sisters"  ohhhh this is different  and then she told me they'd been open 15 years  that's way different  these are trained peoplebtw i wrote this review months ago but yelp just told me i never finished it  so here it is yelpers  i like it
1,nice people and very well-done pedicure very reasonable will definitely be back
1,the ladies & gentleman were very professional & extremely skillfulwould definitely come back here
1,in here to get a manipedi after reading great reviews it smelled like fresh bleach when i walked in and the place was very clean everyone there was very friendly and welcoming and i had a great experience my manicurist spent a lot of time making sure my nails were perfect as i explained i was getting them done for a wedding fair price great service and very clean
1,happy  just walked in and someone was able to take me right away for an acrylic set  my nails are nice and short and thin just like i asked for  nice polish job too  just moved to the area and i think i found my new nail spot  can't wait to come back for a pedicure soon :) $25 for a great acrylic set is nice  oh and i was in and out in less than an hournot too shabby for a full setthanks central nails
1,this place they are all very sweet reasonably priced there is a review below with only one star this place definitely deserves way more than one star very clean facility will definitely be going back
1,i've been with carefree tan for about 2 years now and i love it i would seriously not go anywhere elseme and my boyfriend are there everyday the staff is very friendly and efficient some people would say that it's a little pricey but i beg to differ me and my boyfrind have unlimited tanning with mistique included on a family plan which is definitly worth doingif an option and it's great we love itthe beds are awesome very powerful and have built in fans the mistique is awesome i spray every time after i lay down and i get really dark even after the first timehighly recommended
1,downtown chicago so used to great hair care but this place reminded me of home linda is phenomenal and after stepping a few feet from the door i got a compliment on my hair i highly recommend this to anybody who's looking for great and relaxing haircut
1,love this place i've been a client for about 5 years and have never been disappointed
1,here is great  tam and danny really know what their doing with this place and the prices are more than fair  ladies if you need a set of nails tony is your guy (sorry danny haven't tried you just yet)  super fast and does an uh-maz-ing job for pedicures all the girls are super nice and do a good job-but i would recommend tam if you're making an appointmentclean facilities and great massage chairs for the pedi's broad color selection and their great with designs on all nails too now quit reading this and go get those nails did
1,place to get a pedicure - hands down
1,in last minute on saturday to get a gel mani & pedi completely became a fan right off the bat friendly staff and it was definitely warm and inviting i was fit in quickly and was able to get a super incredible gel manicure def one of the best highly recommended the color selection is unlike any other place i've ever been you can actually show up with out a polish and know you will be able to find a shade you want the pedicure was just absolutely amazing hands down luv luv luv this cute and clean salon this place really pays attention to the fine details and the staff is super friendly and funny i had such a great time getting my nails done i'll definitely be back soon
1,this place they do an excellent job and have the nicest girls i had a horrible experience with my 91 yr old mom just that morning they wouldn't do her nails new to the area and didn't know where to go i drove around for an hour and new there was one in this area we were greeted so warm and friendly they were excellent with my mom and took very good care of both of us we had denise and anna love them will drive the extra mile because of their warm and friendly attitudes great pedi and gel manicure
1,i lived in chandler over 3 years ago i was a regular at this nail salon and loved it but then i moved to cali  when i returned to az in october of 2011 i decided to go back to check them out they have moved and are even better than before  nancy is awesome at eye lash extensions i have been to many places between cali and az and nancy by far does a fabulous job  her technique is unique and she is a perfectionist extensions can be pricey at first but well worth the investment the initial cost is approx $200 and i get refills every 2 weeks i no longer use mascara or eyeliner ans less makeup in general because my eyelashes compensate for it  i get compliments almost everyday on my lashes; the length how naturally full they look and how beautiful my eye arego see nancy and let her work her magic
1,very hesitant when going to nail places from reading all of the scary stories of nail fungus and other horrible things happening because of not using proper sanitation you can see why i'd be apprehensive i've had my fair share of bad experiences especially since everyone cuts too much of my cuticles and i bleed every time my coworker goes here and recommended it to me i made an appointment for the brown sugar pedicure $28 and the callous removal $5 i asked for a more senior nail tech working that day and i got twee she was so friendly and sweet did a fantastic job (no bleeding yay) and she took her time and was very detailed i am going to go back next month before my hawaii trip and get my hands and toes done with shellac so it doesn't chip on my vacation the atmosphere is very calming and soothing there are no tvs on the walls and the music is of a spa love it
1,this place  they are the most detail oriented nail salon i have been to their flowers and designs are fantastic(see my photo) i also like that they have zoya polish for those of us who are a little conscious of the chemicals in regular polish foot massages are great and they take time to do both manicures and pedicures to your standards i've been coming here for over 3 years now and this is my 1 nail salon
1,happy my sisters and i came in on sunday for manipedis everyone was nice and engaging the whole timei received a pedicure from hugh (sorry if i miss the spelling) he was fantastic the only issue i had was the same with all the nail salons i've gone to - its quiettoo quiet a stern look from the head librarian quiet id prefer a little more client centered chatting ie the weather or the game or your boyfriend or whatever
1,have been getting my nails and wax done here for years nancy is incredible- i always leave happy with the services
1,been hanging out in tempe this weekend thinking about what i wanted to do to pamper myself a biti wanted to do something girly - so i went to the front desk of the hotel to inquire about a salon that would be able to give me a pedicure magen nail was close by - so i hopped on board the hotel shuttle and off i wentthis isn't one of those elite fru fru types of places - but it was clean and they were able to take me right away the nail technician was very cute but professional she wore the appropriate garb (face mask and gloves) and used sterilized implements that she had just taken out of the enclave i was in heaven having my tootsies soaked and rubbed she even did a salt scrub and massage on my calf muscles - i could have spent all afternoon there after applying a little purple polish she painted some cute little flowers on my toes and added a couple of rhinestones and had me sit with my toes under the nail dryerwhat a nice way to spend a couple of hours
1,i went to vegas this past weekend a pedicure was a necessity i decided to check out magen nail in tempe since it's close to where i live and they were open until 7 pm on friday you can either make an appointment or just walk-ini made an appointment but it wasn't necessary the interior is very simple and clean which is fine with me since i didn'tt need anything fancy the staff is very friendly and the technician who gave me my pedicure was very sweet we chatted the whole time in fact she did a great job especially with the salt scrub and calf massage (work that day had been stressful and busy so i was in desperate need of relaxation) my pedicure was $19 and the salt scrub was an extra $5 but was totally worth it to me a great experience and i will definitely return in the future for manicures and pedicures
1,the reviews on yelp and thought i better check out what all the stars were all about  i went for a regular pedicure ($19 to start) on a random tuesday afternoon  it is your typical strip mall nail salon but was very clean and nice inside  i was greeted by the techs and had no wait to get my pedi and boy what a pedi it was  my nail tech was very nice and talkative  she wore gloves and used the blue powder to sanitize the bath  she asked if i wanted my nails cut and filed instead of just buzzing through with the scuff file  i opted for the sea salt add on for $5 and she literally massaged my legs with the sea salt for 10 minutes  the sea salt was a nice quality wasn't too coarse and didn't burn my legs since it sat on them for a whilemy nail tech had a waxing appointment come in about  12 way through so another tech took over  he was very nice and polite but his leg massage was out of this world  he worked on my pressure points on the bottoms of my feet as well as my calf muscles  another ten minute massage on top of the ten min sea salt massagemy pedicure was $24 with the sea salt but they start at $19  they also gave me a rewards card for a free service after you have so many manipedi's done  my only gripe is that their colors were very dated but i bring my own polish with me so very easy to bypass that problem  this is my new go to spot for nails  please please please open a magen ii a little closer to scottsdale :)
1,place is really friendly quick to seat you and get you started for a manipedi and it was an overall great experience to just relax and enjoy i totally recommend this place for nails
1,place is great i have had between 6 and 7 pedicures at magen nail and loved them all they do beautiful little flowers on your big toe with crystals if you ask them to the artistry is really lovely the service is always speedy and friendly-- a nice no-nonsense kind of place i went here with my sister who has a deformed nail on one of her feet the pedicurist shaped the nail carefully and made it look "normal" she was very pleased at the final result
1,here the night before my friend's wedding because i was a bridesmaid and found out at rehearsal the other girls got manis and designs on their pedis i had only got a basic pedi that morning i only had about an hour before the dinner and found this place on yelp closeby got in immediately very nice staff - even gave me a bottled water got a gel coat mani (no tips) and it lasted many weeks shape i wanted and looked great i just needed a design on my toes and she did them perfectly as described and they matched the other bridesmaids (just by my description - she didn't see the other girls) a true artist - beautiful work and still fast wish i lived nearby because i would like to go back more often i heard while there they were going to repaint etc so it may be an even better environment now would definitely go back
1, found this place in a pinch when my usual place was closed in the middle of the day for no apparent reason  i didn't have to wait at all  got a gel manicure for the first time and it lasted for over a month while looking perfect  only needed to get it re-done because my nail grew out so much  everyone there is super nice and the price is wonderfully low for my student budget  i only used to get my nails done for special occasions because of cost but  now my nails are always looking great thanks to this place
1,are now under new management and completely remodeled the inside it's fantastic fast quick service with brand new massage chairs and i loved their background music they also have a new discount card program get your nails done 8 times and receive $8 off your next service i'm happy it's so close to work and i can be in and out within a lunch hour
1,almost reluctant to even write a review for magen because i don't want everyone to start going there  i know i'm selfish but i just love this place so much and will never go to another nail salon  the people working there are beyond friendly and always bend over backwards for me and my friends when we go in  they will make sure that we have pillows water and can sit by each other to chat  i have even had one of the ladies paint my nails while i was getting a pedicure because she didn't want me to have to get upthey have hot stones for your massage and they don't skimp on the time  i think my last foot massage there was close to 10 minutesthey have great prices and awesome service  the only thing that would make this place better would be a glass of wine
1,and his wife own this salon -- omg the best nail service i've ever received the wife is a nail artist she has the most amazing nail art i've ever seen their prices are fantastic and they are super nice awesome place and it's super close to my work love going here
1,always come here for a manipedi and all the ladies here do a good job  everyone here is very friendly and accommodating  they also have discount for students so that is always a plus
1,been going here for three years lucy and laura are the best; but everyone is great & the manager is amazing i love her i trust all of their work i get pedicures full set and wax regularly here and they send out a christmas coupon to customers check them out ;-)
1,is my go to place i have been to 5 salons in the vegas area and this one blows them all away they take their time with their clients and are always friendly and worth every penny
1,am so happy at paradise nails  my long time technician is vincent and he is the best  my nails are impeccable and never ever come off  he gives the best pedicures too  make an appointment with him and find out for yourself
1,love this place they always welcome you and do such great work i have had my eyelash extensions done there and the best i have found love the nails i get done as well this place is become family to me :) they do so much more than just nails
1,love fancy nails it is my go-to nail placethey shop is located in a shopping center near sahara and decatur the owner's name is jennifer and she is really sweeti like to keep my nails really short (so i can speed type my yelps) and the aestheticians here never mind me asking if i can get them shorter if i bump my nails or dent the polish (which is all the time) they fix it for free i also like my acrylic thin and yen does it right every single time and she's quickyou can do walk-in or appointmentsthey offer a full range of spa services at decent prices waxing facials pedis manis airbrush and gelthe shop is clean and tidy and had a nice vietnamese flair whenever i leave here my mind sings you fancy huhwanna get fancy this is your one chance and they won't let you down (or reba)
1,came for a weekend to celebrate a bachlerotte and decided to come in and get my nails done i absoulutley love them this will be my to go place every time i go to vegas now 
1,am a loyal customer they do a great job all the time my nails never lift no matter how bad i need fills :) johnny does a great job & jennifer does my nail art always havecomments from ppl saying they love my nails i wont go to any other nail shop in vegas its worth me driving across town
1,love this place everywhere i go i get compliments on my nails  even from guys
1,been going to fancy nails for years jen and johnny do an awesome job timmy does the best pedis ever (you'll be hooked) i highly recommend this place not only are they good they are also reasonable entire staff is knowledgeable and prompt love love love this nail shop
1,very picky about my eyebrows it has taken me years to find someone that keeps them nice and arch and thick  in desperate need i thought id give them a try and best decision ever made jennifer is amazing at eyebrows i can't express that enough she is the only one i trust with them and i've been going to her for over a year
1,went here to get laser hair removal  angela was amazing  very knowledgeable  explained to me step by step each process and was right on the money regarding pain expectations  i had my lip underarms and bikini line done  i absolutely love this and would recommend her to everyone
1,see jim allen for myopractics and massage and he is amazing i have seen a chiropractor before but i definitely prefer the myopractics where soft tissue manipulation is used to balance your body instead of just cracking it back into place it's a much more holistic and gentle way to restore your body to it's natural state of movement and relieve tension and painhis massages are equally amazing and the best i've ever had he has many years of experience and education and he is continually learning new techniques if you are into energy healing and natural healing arts you will love jim he can make you feel like a new person jim is amazing and genuinely cares about each and every client and it comes through in his work he also does cranial sacral and ayervedic massage and can incorporate specific essential oils to suit your needs
1,booked total bliss for my wedding and they were amazingfirst all my appointments and conversations were done over email as i live in nyc i was unable to see the salon before booking but nancy the owner was so incredibly nice it was a pleasure to work with her she even bought fruit cookies and sparkling cider to help celebrate the day - it was a very sweet gesturewe had three stylists working on our hair - trish paula and i think jodi trish and paula were fantastic trish worked on my hair and it exactly matched the picture i brought in jodi did a nice job on my friend's hair however she was a little impolite in the beginning and did not try to talk to any of us trish and paula were very much apart of the group and did fantastic workangela did our make-up along with another lady who i unfortunately cannot remember angela did a wonderful job on my make up and was very personable the other lady seemed very polite as welli am extremely happy with our hair (6 of us got our hair done) and make up (5 us got our make up done) thank you so much
1,had a coupon to try this place a few weeks ago and i had a great experience laura did my eyebrows and she did a fantastic job  she was sweet as can be and professional too  they offer other kinds of waxing here also  i made an appointment ahead of time but i think they are pretty good about walk-ins and last minute appointments also  the brow lady is located in a convenient location and it's small and comfortable inside  i'll be back to see laura again soon for sureinteresting history of 'the brow lady' also read about it at:  http:thebrowladyusacomthe_brow_ladyhtml  this is the kind of local business that makes you feel good to support
1,been over a year since my last brow lady review so it's time for an updatelaura is still the queen of making me look clean and pretty  she is sweet as ever and still affordable toocall today if you need a touch up - i lucked out and found out that this week is a special - brow and lip combo for just $26now that i'm living just a few minutes from the brow lady i'll be seeing laura regularly to keep my brows looking good
1,love this place i have white blond eyebrows and eyelashes and finding a salon that can dye them the correct colors without making a mess of things is difficult at best  when i explained exactly what i needed the girl who did my tinting (sadly i can't remember her name but she was super awesome and nice) got it exactly right i will be back here every 6 weeksedit: the person i saw was laura
1,is the best place to get your brows done i like it that they check with you to ask aboout medications you may be on with your face because there can be serious problems if you wax on certain meds no other place has ever asked me this
1,has now moved to the wind and water spa in scottsdale she is no longer (to my dismay) at the the brow lady i went back to the brow lady and found this out the hard way they did an "ok" job but it wasnt laura
1,if you do go and don't want any of the girls previously talked about in other reviews you should ask for courtney she's new i think because her business cards weren't in yet but she is one of the nicest people i've met the rest of the staff seemed kinda out of it but courtney was very professional which is something i value and whom i'd definitely recommendenvironment: it looks like a hole in the wall type place from the outside  but courtney did a great job of making me feel comfortable and welcomed  (even though i felt bad because i was late to my appointment)overall experience: i had never gotten an eyebrow wax before and let courtney know my concerns but she talked me through everything very good at answering all my questions during the process and was very thorough with the job i never felt like she was rushing just to get me in and out (which i've noticed a lot of spa people do) after coming home to read the negative reviews from this place (largely if not all due to staff) i can tell you that i would not go here if courtney wasn't there think of her as the new laura that everyone had been raving about no one else can compare :)
1,had my eyebrows waxed by courtney she was great and i love the results my eyebrows look awesome & sexy i will definitely go back
1,has been doing my brows for months now and has always done a great job for me she's attentive and listens to what i want i like a natural looking brow but clean and precise and absolutely not over-plucked or over-waxed my brow hairs are not the thickest so getting juuuust the right ones is crucial easy to make them look too thinand just as easy to let one or 2 stray hairs create unpleasant shadows i've also had the unpleasant experience of lingering redness and irritation - but not with courtney i am older so my skin is more fragile; somehow she managed to take that into account and kept the irritation to a minimum i will certainly go back
1,did you goi had my eyebrows done by amanda she did an excellent job it's been at least a year since i've had my eyebrows done by a skilled aesthetician and i was amazed at how amanda was able to even out and clean up the shape it really made a difference my overall experience at the shop was great; everyone was very professional and made me feel welcomed and comfortable customer service and quality for the money determines how i spend my hard earned dollaramanda at the brow lady usa will see me again
1,just wanted to update since it has been awhile since my post it's been two years and  i  continue to get my facials and lash extensions done here in all my visits in the past year i only had  one negative experience and it was resolved quickly and professionally i still love the service location and people here truly the best brow design and lash extensions in scottsdale and again very friendly staff and an owner who is caring and follows through i've been here since june of 2012  so far i have always been treated promptly and kindly i have valerie do my brows and i love them i didn't realize how different they can look by going to a service that specializes in this versus just getting them waxed at the nail salon big difference love it i felt compelled to write this after seeing all the negative reviews i have had nothing but positive experiences here and i actually drive 20 minutes out of my way just to get my brows done here i haven't had any other services at the brow lady so i can't comment as to that but as far as professionalism nice ladies and prompt service it's 5 stars   :o)
1,much all nail salons in arizona are pretty similar feet soak scrubbed then painted not alot of attention to callouses and rough skin  included with the base price which is kind of bs but like i said that seems to be the standard in azwhat set this place apart for me is that she asked me why i was getting the pedi i disclosed that i was departing shortly for a family trip to hawaii and she suggested a fabulous festive nail ideai have attached a photo of this master piece for your viewing enjoyment :)
1,have nothing but good things to say about this salon  i have been going to for nails only for several months  the people are very friendly and they make me feel welcome  they do a quality job and don't rush through the work  i always feel relaxed and happy when leaving  thank you
1,went in for a shellac manicure and was truly impressed  they have a great color selection and my nails were perfect for a whole month  the staff was very nice and friendly  would definitely come back the next time i'm in town
1,love katie's and will not go anywhere else to get my nails done   i have been going there for about 4 years and have no complaints  sure when you walk in they might seem a little rude but once you get talking everyone opens up  they are actually quite funny  katie knows that i am a dog groomer and am very hard on my nails  my nails do not break and on the rare occasion that they do katie is very prompt to repair it
1,is great  they listen to what you say and they can even fix ingrown toenails  wait time has never been more than 15 minutes  also katie remembers everything about everyone  i have tried almost every other nail salon within a 3-mile radius and katie's truly is the best
1,been going to katie for about two years after a referral by my boss i have gone to many different nail stylists but have always had problems with the acrylics lifting and cracking because my nails are very curved with katie this has never been a problem i don't know how she does it but her acrylics stay put i always get compliments on my nails - even two weeks after my appointment they stay looking good for a long time and that is saying something since i am very rough on my nails katie also has a full rainbow of gel colors available i recently went through a spell where i wanted something different from my usual pink-and-white so i switched seamlessly to gel for about two months this was a lot of fun and it is amazing how long the color stays on and shiny however i've gone back to pink-and-white because that is how i prefer my nails pedicures here are great too ask for kevin as he is fabulous
1,are one of my small indulgences- a monthly pedicure keeps my toes in sandal condition during the summer historically i haven't had much loyalty to one nail place or another- but this one might change that i saw kevin for my appointment and not only did he do a a fantastic job but he was personable and nice to talk to the place was clean and my wait time was minimal a basic manipedi combo was only $35 which is a steal if you ask me i'll definitely be back it gets five stars because if you're comparing it to other strip mall nail places it's as good as it gets i figure that's a lot more fair than comparing it to dolce or the phoenician
1,through arizona and needed some 'me time' once we stopped at our hotel in scottsdale i called around found gel q and headed over joe my nail tech was so detail oriented during my entire mani-pedi he was also very gifted at massage the atmosphere was tranquil and professional and the pedicure chairs had massagers in them that were to die for it was just the relaxing appointment i was hoping for thank you gel q
1,a good nail spot in ot  after stopping at several nail salons last saturday that were closed packed or too shady to step foot in we used our yelp apps and navigated our way to gel-o thank you fellow yelpers for this recommendation  from the outside this place appears to be a typical strip mall nail salon but one you walk in it has a slightly classier feel to it  we were greeted immediately and given an estimated wait  as i was deciding on a color i noticed something that (shouldn't but) really impressed me  they don't appear to be watering down their colors what a treat  in addition they had a good selection of modern colors with bottles that were pretty full  lately i've noticed that a lot of the nail salons dilute the polish as it is used to make it last longer for them but as a result it either never dries or flakes off way too quickly i was also very pleased to see the lady sanitize every single thing she used for the pedicure including the basket that she stored the tools in a++the prices are about $5 more than the typically strip mall salon but it was well worth it i had a 4 star spa quality pedicure for half the price i swear she massaged my feet and legs for about 30 minutes i was in heaven i'll definitely be back
1,place is awesome best nail salon i have experienced in a long time great prices great polish selection and i even got a shoulder massage while my nails were drying i'll be back
1,place is great now i would like to qualify my 5 stars these strip mall nail salons usually suck so bad that 1 star is too many that being said as a strip mall nail salon goes this place is top-notch but don't go expecting some amazing 5 star spa you won't get it what you will get is a clean sanitized friendly staff the guy did my pedicure and it was one of the best i've ever had my feet & calves were so sore from ballet and now - they feel great i got gels done and i will say they aren't really set up to do gel toes (they are for hands) i wish they had the uv light a little more convenient for feet i had to get up each time but otherwise a very pleasant experience for a very stressed woman
1,go here often to either get gel manicures or acrylics and i have not once had a bad experience the staff who have done my nails have been patient and helpful as well as friendly from my experience i enjoy that they have a tv in the back of the salon to keep you entertained while you get your nails done the only thing is they seem slightly expensive to me for a manicure with gels its $40 and same with pedi and  polish then again i don't know rates for other salons so this may be reasonable i don't have anything bad to say besides the first time i got acrylics there they gave me flares which i didn't like but i didn't know the difference
1,am giving this place 5 stars for a strip mall nail salon it isn't super fancy but for what it is it is a great place the salon is quiet and clean the people were very nice and they got to me quickly even though i was a walk-in the woman doing my nails (loan) was very nice and professional she clearly paid attention to detail and did a wonderful job on my nails and i only paid $25 for a gel manicure i will definitely be returning
1,the rating of five stars for bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment instead the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint]walking into bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'showgirls' -- and what i mean is one is piqued with curiosity wonderment the promise of mindblowing mockery and the anticipation of an inevitable spidey exit  this is where the comparison to showgirls ends  actually i don't rememer  did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimesterwhereas the tagline for showgirls was "leave your inhibitions at the door" bandaids follows up with " and your guns knives nerve gases babies peg legs raptor jesuses gold crown deodorizers and herpes"  although i think most in there ignored that last oneso upon entrance you are greeted with a very judge dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your abe lincoln and motions you over to the bar  one thing about strip clubs in general is you don't really wanna schooch by anyone  but at bandaids they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone  the walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at giants stadium  i felt like tyler durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at "the talent"whoa boy  this place has talent like the old washington bullets  but shorter fatter and more pregnanti gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a "whusssuuup" that featured her sweet gold grill  to appreciate this you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet and gave a friendly "hi" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 coors lights were posting up our jawsthis was a nice natural cue for a quick exit rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out  we couldn't stomach anymore of anythingbut waiton this page you will notice jason c and along with the others in our laughter-induced group came his big mouth  this was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off convertible primer-gray chevy blazer parked mere feet from the entranceexit to bandaids and although the details are lost as to the specifics mentioned something about "check out this fucking thing" which was the perfect timing for one of the busted ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like "fuck you  that's mine  what of it"  in response and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers said something like "oh  its nice  i like it" before shitting himselfi'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace  anyway  that's the bandaids story and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance
1,motherfucking dive bar of strip clubsif you byoc (bring yo own company bitches) it is awesome in this case i was the company for a totally non-trashy very classy female friend of mine who was in the mood to slum it she lives down the block an had been wanting to check the place out for a while so after a few hours of daydrinking we hit the spot wowstretch marks lots of grinding and wandering hands tits everywhere and shit that's just the male patrons holmes i was wearing all black (as usual) and put on my sunglasses for the lulz now and then and my exceptionally skinny and lovely companion was paying with a stack $1's that she won in a dice game the night before so the ladies and waitress probably figured that she was a stripper (she's actually an rn in an icu) and that i was her coke dealer and the guys were jealous that i was hanging with a hot babe whom i didn't have to pay for attention so i guess that made me by default the coolest motherfucker in the place how could i not give it 5 stars after thatin reality we had a sociological discussion about the patrons and employees and discussed a few articles in the latest issue of the new yorker which she happened to have in her purse some of the characters we saw:saigon '68 - old dude who only got dances from the asian girls reliving the glory days in 'namhombre - in his sunday finest with cowboy hat and boots looking very confused he might have jumped the border last weekpcc - white haired super thin wrinkly cracker who probably wandered in from the phoenix country club across the street in shorts white polo knee high white socks and of course velcro sneakers he looked reminiscent of a corpse except when he got several dances from well endowed black women at which point he really became alive short dick man - he had clearly sprouted some wood and it wasn't very impressive vatos - galoreso - think dive bar that is totally ghetto fab if you wait around long enough they'll have 2 for 1 drink specials though i am sure that the "grey goose" i ordered was some shitty well shit and not the goose whatever ghetto fabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
1,star reviews aren't just for the fanciest places on earth  oh no  5 stars within a class  bandaids is in it's own class of dirty run down last stop stripper establishments and within that class bandaids is primo  i've never had a bad time here  never
1,a socially liberal feminist i would never go here but if i slipped up the hi-liter  would be my favorite of the genrei've heard that it's just seedy enough but not too much and with top notch "talent"  i mean  that's what i've heard anyway*oink oink*
1,$9 steak and lobster on thursdays is out of this worldcheap food and great entertainment what more could ask for
1,thanks to all the cool people over at the hi-liter for an awesome time during my best friends bachelor party we had a large group and the staff at the hi-liter treated us right from start to finish
1,me start this yelp by saying i've never given the business to a stripper are we clear oki'll tell you why this place gets five stars because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me one for $250 she said "if you have $250 we can go somewhere together" and then she licked my ear and showed me her guns her shift was over and she was in street clothes mind youso guess what happened next stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said "gross some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible" i was embarrassed yet psychologically removed from that experiencewhat happened with stripper two is a great story but i don't know that i want to share it here but if you go to this club one piece of advice (useful alert): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you the self-possessed hotter ones do not however if you get her naked in your bed do no verify pre-coitus that she is not in fact a prostitute because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her or so my buddy tells me such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior
1,place i took my work colleague there and she had a great time the dancer was all over her and left her virtually touched everywhere she was hot and so was i will definitely be back there soon
1,so yeah i am goin there well actually i have all ready been there and back this is the place to be really it is no not for the drinks but for the view it's all about the view and the best 10 dollars you will spend in a 3 minute time span i do not recommend going to the vip why you ask welll because for 10 bucks your still gonna get grind-ed on boobs in your face and prob walk out with a load in your shorts maybe even a hand up your shorts if you sit on the end against the wall and your a perv an wear super short shortsyep really there  all different styles of girls to choose from tattooed tits on a stick average beautiful girl next door beauty is all over the place go take your girl then go home and do the dirty
1,are other gentlemen-type places around town that deserve their accolades but i never have as much fun as when i'm at the hi-liter  a friend from out-of-town wanted to go to a gentlemen-type establishment  when i suggested the hi-liter she recoiled saying that the place looks skeezy  i begged for some faith and of course nobody was disappointed  cheap (by strip club standards) drinks friendly staff everyone in the place - customers and employees - having a good old time  upon leaving we asked for a cab and one was there in under two minutes  here's something that always happens and it happened again tonight:the waitresses often wear shorts that say "hi liter" across the derriere  you'll never notice this until everyone is s-faced and then someone will say "i cant believe that girl's ass says 'hitler'"  then you stare until you regain some vision and realize that it doesn't  this has happened at least 3 times at this place no joke  might not seem funny but mix alcohol andor other social lubricants with loud music and and general tomfoolery and it's funnier than the last three adam sandler movies combined (not saying much but still)overall there are other clubs that do other things better but you'll never have as much fun as you do here
1,went on a tuesday night 101111 around 10 pm have been here in the afternoon but not at night the cover was only $5 and they still had the 2 4 1 specials there was a variety of hot dancers so i got a seat against the wall and had some dances from a hot blonde  a super hot latina and a hot and sexy seductive hawaiian  the hawaiian is who i spent most time with she had a tight sexy seductive body and crawled all over me they were all very very close dances there was skin on skin contact and damn she smelled good even though it was a slow night they still had a large variety of dancers everytime i am in town i check out this club and they never disappoint last time i was here was september 1 and it was the hawaiians  first night she was fantastic one tip if you are getting a hot dance in the main room you know the vip will be hot if the lap dance is not hot and you hope it gets hotter in vip it won't  believe me on this even if you don't go vip you will have a  good time i have been to the other establishments including the nude bars but find this is the one place that never disappoints the food is good the dancers are hot great drink specials and the bouncers are chill
1,late tuesday afternoon 1025  the sexy hawaiian was busy in vip with regulars but there was a large variety of hot dancers to choose from i got dances from a damn sexy blonde with beautiful face and gorgeous body and great tat work on the side of her body she knows  what she is doing and you should get a dance or vip from her you will never forget it lots of cuddling touching and grinding she is usually there in afternoons  sabrina is another beauty that knows how to give a hot dance this place always delivers if you are wondering where to go this is the place
1,haven't been to the hi-liter in years but have fond memories of this fine establishment  a couple of years ago i was kicked in the head by a dancer who was giving a dance to mike tyson  twice  there was no blood so i let it slide  i mean did i really want to take a chance interrupting mr tyson's good time and risk decapitation  i think not
1,far the best gentleman's club in phoenix  the girls here are gorgeous  it is a little pricier than some of the other places but the eye candy is the best  have fun other weary travelers
1,not been to a strip club in awhile i had a blast with clients at phoenix's most famous gentlemen's club  $10cover and $10lap dances with friendly gorgeous well mannered entertainers made the night go way too quicklyhighlights include a pair of parisian identical blonde twins and a brazilian angel who looked like she belonged on the cover of vogue
1,strip club in phoenix no contest went here tonight after writing strip club reviews all day which sparked a debate among my friends - we decided to check it out since none of us had been here before and why the fuck haven't we i'm pretty picky and i'll just say that every girl in here is good looking and has a good body even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town many of them are downright beautifulcover was 8 bucks there wasn't a drink minimum (but drinks were as pricey as any other club) and dances were 10 bucks vip was 20 bucks and wasn't terribly private but it was nice my girlfriend got some good dances and we spent our 80 bucks so quick we had to make another run to the atm before we had even been there an hour the place has 3 stages and the girls have to rotate to all three which keeps them from being available for awhile and that's kind of a bummer it's nice though because there's always something to look at there are a lot of girls here too so you won't be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance i was told that the management here was great too and most of the girls i talked to had worked at other clubs but found this one to be the best by far this place is a little more laid back than other clubs the girls don't go crazy with the pole dancing - guess when you're hot you don't have to at first i thought they were just looking bored but when they come around to chat they light up this place is more about mingling than watching a showbourbon street blows the doors off pretty much every club in town and even ones in vegas if you have the urge for flesh or out of town guests and just want a mellow time with some beautiful girls putting boobs in your face definitely go here
1,place very hot women 3 stages for women to dance on so you can move around and check out a diff stage if you want i was there on a thurs nite so the girls outnumbered the customers and they were all hot there was also amazing diversity as the girls come in all shapes sizes and ethnicities the best thing is this is the friendliest place i've been to so far i saw two old guys chilling with like 5 girls around them and the girl that gave me a dance didnt just shake her ass in front of me like most places she made it very personal also the girls here are sociable and lastly they give you popcorn lol
1,safe and cool place every kind of dancer you can imagine
1,wanted to give bourbon st 4 stars because i take issue with the perception of  "perfection" in pretty much any establishment but i could not think of any complaints about this place also of the 5 az strip clubs i have been to this one is the best hands downmy observations:- impressive selection of hot girls- interesting blend of music- super dark- good seating pretty much anywhere- three stages- popcorn- tasty drinks- friendly concierge-type staffthe best thing for a female client is the ladies' room is in the strippers' locker room so you get to see a lot of t&a on the way for a people watcher like me this is priceless probably my favorite part of going to bourbon st
1,is just the best club i have ever been to the dancers are all professionals like you wouldn't believe sometimes pornstars come work in this club too the vip used to be run by a duo of ladies and i've never seen a more rotated vip room seriously it doesn't make sense that the vip is hosted by men think about it anyways the chairs are cushy and oversized the stage has cool lighting and there are many corners to get lost in i thought the food was good too crazy
1,fiance and our friends always have a great time here girls are nice place is clean the popcorn is a plus scottsdale clubs are closer but this place is worth the extra drive time
1,drinks and rad girls i always stop for some rock n' roll at the store when im in phx :)
1,entry fees and $5 lap dances are amazing  chill place to hang out been with my girlfriend and she loves it and has always had a great time
1,and i were out with some friends on saturday night and decided to hit this place up around 9pm when we rolled in we were shocked at the $5 cover charge who else has it so cheap great start to our evening :)we easily found some nice seats on couches towards the back but the place is smallish so we had awesome views of the larger stage it was kinda disappointing with the first couple dancers because they seemed to be more interested in staring at themselves in the mirrors to see how hard they could frown so it got a few doubts going but then some amazing dancers blew our minds two girls in particular stuck with us for a while and gave us all lap dances and did some really crazy tricks on the chairs $7 lap dances sign us up we all agreed who needs christie's $20 dances when we can get gorgeous ladies and great music here btw-the music was just fabulous lots of variety (lil rap not much lots of rock like metallica lil punk) so everyone in our group was rocking out hardcore-in more ways then one ;) guys girls lesbians (we saw a few)-no matter-the candy store will take care of you all :d go get your jelly watch on
1,only thing to not like about this place is that it's small really small i've lived inside of bigger tissue boxes but that's just an excuse to get extra close to your special lady ;dthe girls here are very friendly there's a large variety of girls and a large selection of music the decor threw me off but you didn't come in to look at the couchesif you did you have other problems i've always had a good time here and recommend this place above all others of it's type in the valley female-friendly dancers are hard to findwell ones that give mind blowing lap dances are anyway i second carissa
1,going to the candy store with my buds keep in mind i'm in no way an expert at t&a --- but even i recognized beautiful women when i see 'em this place has improved over the years and far as female dancers go$7 lap dances uhhhone lap dance long ago was enough for me --  barking up the wrong side of the tree here --- but it was great fun girls can jam and do some kewl tricksnowi do know about their great turkey and top sirloin burgers we often hit this place up for their great specials on saturdays afternoons perfect spot to watch footballs games on the weekends so overall i kewl straight buds put up with many of my suggestions for our many of our outings so going to this spot every now and then isn't so bad sometimes being a fly on the wall can be fun :)
1,got to love it girls were lots of fun dances were inexpensive drinks and dj were great met mike "the mayor" he fell in love with our girls def will be back
1,place was great - we came around 4 pm so no cover  then one of the hotties played about 10 games of pool against me and the boys  she also happened to be the best dancer we saw all night  on top of that overall the personalities of the gals working there was great  they were all very talkative and fun to visit with
1,was girls night sono entry feethis is my second time coming to this place the first time i was already pretty hammered so this last time i felt i was sober-er at least enough to cognitively rate this place and it still gets 5 stars in my book being that i've gone to places in the past like "spearmint rhino" and other raunchy places i've learned not to expect much out of strip clubs the girls are usually trashy look a bit like they're working to feed their drug habit and look like they haven't worked out in months yet this place for 1 am on a tuesday the girls were beautiful i was surprised at how attractive everyone was and they were in great shape being a female sometimes strippers get awkward with women but these girls are friendly and seem genuine now the routines i think a few times i turned my head and said "how do you hang like that" this place really validates that stripping should be an olympic sport i'm still shocked at how cheap their lap dances aresidenote: why do men like to watch you get lap dances you go with a guy to a strip club and they want to buy you a dance i'm fine watching from a distance thank you  i just have to awkwardly look like i'm into it while you're getting more enjoyment out of it than  lets skip me just buy yourself a lap dance i'll yelp while you enjoy that for some time anyways being from california i had never been to a topless strip club that serves liquor yes now i can drink while watching girls in white fishnets shimmying up a pole under a black light winning god bless you arizona liquor laws i like the loungeseating set up of this place really comfortable and not too crowded still have the ability to walk around without side-stepping between people the bartenders were great very quick to assist and friendly if strip clubs are your thing check it out
1,had a chance to check this place out buddy of mine and i drove by this place and didn't know anything about it we just finishing some home remodeling sowe thought we would at least have a few drinks and unwind whata whata whooyee nailanation doabrit this place runs circles around some of the high end places you'd find in vegas seriously i don't frequent these places cause that's just me but this place is clean comfortable fun quality models and a great entertainment value
1,here one time in april and one time in july both visits were great most girls are attractive while some are a bit older at this place cover 5 beer 475 a dance 10 which beats most strip clubs anywhere else it is a rather small place with two stages overall a great atmosphere
1,this place hi chloe
1,usually stop in here on my way back to los angeles and i love it  the place is huge and i actually had a girl give me a discounted lap dance because i told her i was just hitting the greyhound back to la good times
1,is definitely one of the best clubs in the country my boyfriend and i love going to strip clubs and we had a blast here great energy all around friendly staff friendly girls fun atmosphere if you are ever in the phoenix area this is the place to check out the area is pretty bad but it's safe there not sure on the prices but lap dances are around $10-20 and vip is around $300 for an hour (you can correct me on that)
1,best club year over year business man lunch is not as satisfying as the ladies
1,this place its definitely not your cheesy megaclub with 100+ girls that swarm you & hound you all night it's the perfect combination of gentlemen's club meets little local bar the staff is friendly & the atmosphere is relaxed  there's a good variety of beautiful dancers: from straight-out-of-a-magazine model types to the curvier girl next door look another nice thing about the dancers is they aren't all bleached blonde big fake boob valley girls: they have redheads brunettes blondes white girls black girls hispanic girls asian girls etc sam's is off the strip across from chinatown they have video gaming at the bar happy hour drink prices from 7a-7p free entry for locals they don't serve food but you can ask the waitress or door girl for a menu to have food delivered from one of the nearby restaurants (flamingo pizza seems to be a big hit lol) the stage is kind of cool because it has 2 poles (some of the girls are pretty good on the pole too) in addition to the couches for lap dances they have vip & fantasy room dances too if you're looking for an off the strip local's-spot type gentlemen's club definitely check it out
1,24 hours gambling and topless entertainers12 hours of happy hourmachines hit constantly great service all around from the moment you walk in the door cheers las vegas atmosphere

1,vegas strip club experience little darlings was an amazing experience lol hottest chicks all nude best overall value compared to other strip clubs in vegas which are topless only and super expensive went on a tuesday and it was awesome plenty of girls good atmosphere they say the lap dances are two for one on tuesday but it seems all the strippers had their own price some say $20 for a lap dance others $40 either way great experience fine girls for sure will go again next time i'm in vegas the only complaint is the cover which is $30 for visitors and if you get money out of the atm there it's a $10 fee which is insane so bring plenty of cash
1,girls in the club had time of my life
1,love little darlings  i've spent several days in the club  and i got a lot of action  it's a dirty little place with $20 lapdances in the back with no cameras  for those of you with your heart set on drinking this isn't your club but i go there to get pussy
1,puppet slam  my favorite thing to do in phoenix"quirky edgy puppet shows by arizona's leading quirky edgy puppeteers"i've been to the last three adult puppet slams and they just keep getting better and better  the writing is intelligent and the puppetry is as creative as puppetry can get  personally i'm not a big fan of stand-up comedy especially of the 'dirty just for the sake of being dirty' variety and these adult puppet slams are right up my alley  before my first visit i expected rude and crude humor (since the shows are 21 and over) and i couldn't have have been more surprisedthe shows are 'late night with conan o'brien' quality and the theater itself - an old mormon church - is worthy of a visit just for its architectural wonderfulness  they serve cheap drinks the shows are full-feature length and the lobby doubles as the country's premier puppet museumtwo notes:a) the shows are growing in popularity  buy your tickets in advanceb) the adult puppet slams seem to pop up unexpectedly on the theater's schedule  visit their website monthly or else you'll miss the show announcement
1,work had me bring a group of kids here for a field trip  this place was awesome  the old building is well maintained and great to look at  during the show all my kids were engaged  the puppeteer held there attention really well and the show was a perfect length for kids  i actually quite enjoyed the show  my only complaint was the simple fact that while it is called the great arizona puppet theater i did not see a single puppet  they were all marionettesi would have given this place a 4 start review but they came to my site and put on a show for my kids which was extremely entertaining and quite funny (they had puppets this time)  i asked the puppeteer if they had later showings or shows geared more towards adults and she said they did  i am really looking forward to attend one of these
1,took my 6 year old daughter here when it was 115 outside and we had nothing to do   boy do i regret not coming here sooner  it is reasonably priced the staff is friendly the show was fantastic and there was pre-show crafts where we were able to make our own puppets  the puppeteer was using marionettes for this show (rapunzel) and it was neat to see her show the kids how each one of them worked  she even explained her stage set up and was very interactive with the kids  after the show she put the marionettes down to the kids level so they could get a better look and answered all the questions the kids asked  the architecture here is amazing  i have read that this historic building was a church and i am not surprised  it really is a special place  i will be taking a group of 2 year old kids tomorrow  i think they will enjoy it just as much as my 6 year old did
1, fyi this review only concerns the puppet slam for adultsskip spending more money for a harkins ticket and come see the hilariously entertaining and offbeat puppet show $8 dollars if you reserve them in advance acts are all great some raunchy and dirty some a bit more indie with a social commentary vibe  overall all really intricate and you can see the work and dedication put into the puppets and staging  beautiful  best part of all the puppet theatre is inside an old mormon church so please drink a beer (or five) and watch frisky puppets telling vulgar jokes  that being said the facility is gorgeous lovely exterior and huge wooden castle-like doors opening into the theatre room i love that a place like this exists and is a great way to spend a spontaneous friday night
1,place for families puppet making before (or after) the show and original live theater for a great price you can also see the puppet museum they also have guest artists who come in from time to time if you missed the amazing puppeteer from india who came in you missed an amazing showexperiencesome reviewers are concerned about the rules at the puppet theater kids have to learn the rules to be good audience members so everyone can enjoy the showbring the whole family have a good time if the weather's nice you can hang out in the park across the street afterwards puppet fans - it doesn't get much better than this
1,place is great
1,was not sure i would enjoy an adult puppet show but i have to say the evening was a blast the skits were laugh out loud funny the building is an historic morman church very cool you can enjoy an adult beverage a glass of wine or beer as you watch the puppet show treat yourself to this venue
1,building and a real phoenix treasure i've been going to their gift shop for years even when it was still located at dunlapi-17 lots of gifts and memorabilia from ireland as well as the various countries of the uk the main ownerorganizer is very nice and seems to have dedicated his life to bringing the irish history of arizona to the peoplewent in today to have a gander at the tea selection and two older irish gentleman were working it was great to listen to some stories and some irish language while looking around the shop only wish more people cared about this place so that it could grow a bit more
1,a beautiful addition to the downtown area  the architecture and stonework make this one of the nicest buildings in the downtown area
1,this is so much more than a dance education center  it truly is a wonderful cultural center where you can learn the history of ireland and its people  the mcclelland irish library part of the irish cultural center opened in october of 2012 after 5 years of planning within the library is a genealogy centre where you can trace your irish roots or your irish-scots roots or of any of the other peoples who came to ireland and settled wwwazirishlibraryorgprograms classes festivals and exhibitions are offered on a regular basis at the irish cultural center  check wwwazirishorg for dates times and details on all the offered services and upcoming eventsif you do nothing else tour the buildings and grounds it appears to be a small stone building from central but when you park and walk through the iron gates you will find you have entered a large complex and another worldplenty of parking is behind the center
1,i have been through the storytelling centre i write specifically about the john knox house attached to and also operated by the centre  i have been to the house a number of times and it is truly a gem of history (political and intellectual) specifically focused on scotland's and particularly edinburgh's turbulent reformation era  its curator dr donald smith is a treasure house of knowledge about the religio-political currents of that time and if you have any desire to dig beneath the surface of the history of that time in depth i encourage you to arrange a tour with him  the house and centre are real gems that the city is lucky to have
1,are magical doors into other cultures and lives the storytelling centre quite literally has magical doors into stories children love the little doors in the cafe area which they can open to reveal clips of stories little dioramas pictures and artefacts then even more magically the whole wall is a door revealing a storytelling space the centre offers regular storytelling sessions for all ages and tastes get their programme and you're sure to find something that piques your interest want to tell stories yourself there's lots of training opportunities here too
1,had to take the time to give this place the credit and thanks that it truly deserves city of the world puts on some great things and definitely helps to support the local artist in us all i personally have been renting a spot monthly for first friday from city of the world and everyone that runs the gallery is truly very friendly and wants to do what they can to help you further your opportunitiesone of the things i really like about this gallery is that when you walk around it you see many many different types of art its not just one artist and one medium not that individual showings are bad but i really enjoy the mix of pieces in the gallery i would recommend taking the time to stop by the gallery and take a look around and to top it off take a piece of the art on the walls home to help spice up your own place a bit all while helping out a local gallery and a local artist
1,new attraction here in scottsdale the 3d movie is great  the atrium is amazing
1,thought this pretty good a little spendy but if you take your time and really see everything it not that bad  we went through the whole thing twice  definitely a must see but it will be awhile before my next trip
1,wonderland made our weekend i love love love this place there's a butterfly theater where you learn about the lives of butterflies via 3d there's a very cute gift shop a cacoon gallery where you can see butterflies taking form and of course; the habitati've been reading some of the other reviews yes of course the habitat is hot and humid these specific breeds of butterflies are found in the rainforest; other conditions would kill them still i'm positive that even people who aren't either a) cold all the time or b) butterfly enthusiasts will love it i'm actually warm all the time and i fell in love with the place butterflies float right by you sometimes land on your clothes and flutter in bowls of fruit flowers and on plants they are beautiful it's really calming and amazing to see them so close-up two helpful hints for the habitat: a) you aren't supposed to touch the butterflies with your hands it's not good for them and b) look at the ground when you're walking some of the butterflies relax down therethere's also a small aquarium area with fish and you can pet a stingray you can see bees in their natural habitat ants and scorpions also it would be cool if they had a ladybug exhibit tooof course i bought the limited-time-offer lifetime membership $100 for lifetime access i know we'll be back many (many) times i absolutely recommend this place for a datefamily outingengagement proposalsome-much-need alone time basically anyone should be able to manage an excuse to go here
1,found this place out by a group i belong to i decided to go ahead instead i wasn't disappointed the cost is a bit high $20 for just me first they take you into a theatre to watch in 3-d the flight of the monarch butterflies then you go into a small room with large windows showing cocoon butterflies coming out of them there is such wild metallic gold and silver ones but they were not hatching just wish the room was bigger because after the theatre everyone is crabbed into this small room you have a choice of entering the butterfly exhibit or view the hatching the minute you go into the live butterfly exhibit they land on you there is so many different species to take pictures of them  the area gets really humid and uncomfortable so you leave to the air conditioned cafe or to the ant bee aquarium  and stingrays amazing large aquariums with someone to tell you about the exhibit i thought this place was very educational and relaxing even with the large crowd
1,will be going back kids loved it and so did i
1,a great place for all ages we really enjoyed the fantastic 3d video intro about the monarch butterfly there are many beautiful butterflies to see up close in a natural environment also there is a bee hive which bees are able to go outside collect pollen and return the queen is visible there is a wonderful aquarium with fish swimming around and touchable the best thanks for co i g to scottsdale anyone want to volunteer there with me
1,place is amazing and is totally worth the ticket fee  be sure to check this out  get their first thing to avoid overcrowding
1,to see  we loved it
1,great indoor place to bring the kids for something fun to do  highly recommend
1,place is great for kids particularly my two crazy kids who are in awe and wonder with the thousand of butterflies that are here for adults it's good too but not as great as for the kids
1,max wrote up a review for this  i was writing reviews for the sig derb in the mgm grand reviewsbest game in vegasever  even better than spot the hookertwo rolls of quarters can last you an hour and a half on a bad streak ($20)  i've hit the 200-1 here twice  in july 2010 february 2011  each was a $1 bet  $200 profit  thanks i'll go blow it all on craftsteak or head to mandalay bay and grab a surf-n-turf burger  burger bar (lobstah bugahhh)i have gotten drunk at this game for minimum amounts i've stayed sober at this game i've played it with 20+ people surrounding it waiting for a seat on a holiday weekend and i've played it with 1 other person at the tablebest game in vegasno lie note: last sigma derby machine in vegas  thanks mgm grand for keeping the dream alive
1,was here three years ago and my friends walked me up and down the strip for an entire week stopping at every casino asking the question of where the heck is the horse game we couldn't find it so when i saw the review on yelp i bookmarked so i could come check it out it was a ton of funthere is a spot for 10gamers a change machine on site to get quarters and in the 3hours i spent there i only saw 1 empty spot this is by far the only game ive seen that gets the players as well as the crowd that gathers so engrossed they yell and scream at the horses like they were at the track themselvesthere was a group from germany there last night and speaking german a little i loved listening to them and watching their excitement these guys were even making side bets out side of the game and i was just waiting for security to come put a stop to our fun outside of the machine breaking down three times in the time i was there we were left alone and it was an amazing timecheck this game out asap it may end up in storage again soon
1,this game oops i mean play this game if you are into good old fashion vintage vegas fun + camaraderie the table is located very near the buffet in the mgm grand  the rumor is that its the only one left on the strip and one of two in vegas  the sigma derby table is a place of pure magic one of the only games that still takes and pays out quarters each player sits with their own board and bets on which 2 tiny ponies out of five that they think will win after each race the odds come up and you have 30 seconds to pick your ponies i have yet to see the 200:1 odds hit but because of the derby magic its common knowledge that whenever you have the chance you bet the longshotyou don't want to be the only person who didn't how can you not bet the 200:1 when the amazing oldtimer across from you with his oxygen in yells horse time with the derby comes amazing company like this as much money as you can sit and lose playing this game its always worth it and you still have a chance to walk away ahead one night barely paying attention i won 150 quarters and danced my way back to my room with my tiny bucket of coinsyou end up sitting for hours with like minded sigma derby lovers drinking free cocktails and yelling at five tiny plastic horses what more can you ask for find the sigma derby the next time your in vegas it only takes 1 quarter to get yourself into the game
1,indeed this is the best game in vegasyou might have to scavenge for it during the mgm remodel butbut it's so so so worth the stop
1,love this game
1,don't know how long it was out for repairs but it's currently right back by the buffet  just played it all weekend :)
1,at mgm right now and it is not in its usual place by the "win a car slots"it's now right by the grand buffet and they moved the grey hound racing game down by the barbut both are still at mgm
1,love this freaking machine  it's still alive and kickin' (for now) at the mgm grand near the buffet  we played several times and there was always a lively crowd surrounding this gamei love that you can play with actual quarters instead of this "insert at least $1" crap that most of the other digitized "25 cent" games are pulling now  sutton c said it well - you'll definitely develop a sense of camaraderie with the folks around the table with you as you all bet the odds (playing it safe or putting it all on the highest stakes)  i haven't seen anyone "make it big" on this machine; mostly everyone who plays seems to just fritter away their quarters slowly or break even in the end  there's something so charming about the actual metal horsies under the glass running the course  and it's exciting - any pair of them could win each time  it's impossible to tell at the start who will cross the finish first and if there is a pattern i couldn't pick up on it making this game a thrill every timei hope it lasts a long long time
1,bought groupons for unicorn balloon company to help my mother fulfill one of the items on her "bucket list" i was a bit worried as i had read a less-than-stellar review but ultimately i was impressed by the professionalism of this company we had no problems using the groupons and making the reservations a few months in advance we met the van at the designated time and they took us to the launch site checking the air currents for the best launch site they allowed non-riders to follow to the site as well our pilot capt john bagwell was very knowledgeable and personable telling humorous stories interspersed with ballooning facts he also took video of the flight which will be available via e-mail at no extra cost - something most ballooning companies do not do our flight lasted about 1 12 hrs and apparently our chase truck had a flat tire so was a bit late getting to the landing site (though others in view did not) we did tip on landing but at the current windspeed that was to be expected and the pilot warned us that it would happen (note re: previous reviewer: the chase crew does not "help you land") we had a champagne toast and continental breakfast as they presented certificates a very nice morning indeed
1,balloon company took me on my very first hot air balloon ride and i had an absolute blast  i opted for the sunrise ride and despite the very early meeting time (7am in cave creek which is about 45 minutes away from phoenix) it was completely worth it to see the first glimmers of dawn spread over the desert splashing pink hues over every surfacewe wound up taking off near about 15 other balloons (although this is not always the case) and it was sensational to see all the other balloons speckled brightly against the skythe basket fits up to 12 people and though it is a tight fit it's not uncomfortable and everyone gets a great viewafter the ~1 hour flight the pilot john offered up a champagne toast (or oj for non-drinkers)i felt completely safe from start to finish and simply fascinated by the balloonsparting thought: must be pretty cool to live in the surrounding area and see the balloons go up every day
1,my 2 children and i celebrated my dad's 75th birthday with a hot air balloon ride over gilbert it has been my dad's dream to soar above gilbert so he could see his home from above what an adventure we had ironically we took off right across the street from my home and soared west towards my dad's the view from above was spectacular shane was our pilot his professionalism and focus on maintaining our safety made our trip a memorable one knowing there is no guarantee where the winds would take us shane fulfilled my dad's dream we have great shots of both of our homes from above thanks shane for a great ride i highly recommend aerogellic ballooning
1,best friend and i went on a 5am hot air balloon ride for her birthday last friday and it was amazing i booked our ride a few weeks in advance with jessica and was able to get the date we wanted with no problem the meeting location was easy to get to shane the pilot was hilarious knowledgeable made us feel safe and the view over gilbert was phenomenal i would definitely recommend aerogelic
1,up extra early to take this balloon flight was expecting to find the balloon already waiting for us that was not the case  this was the greatest to see how they actually put the balloon together with the basket then we boarded the balloon basketit was so well done that we were so comfortable and had the best flight thanks to shane sean and mario
1,ballooning has always been one of my favorite ballooning companies in the phoenix area  i've previously worked for 2 separate broker companies partnering with aerogelic ballooning and our customers consistently gave great reviews and never a complaint for this hot air balloon company  i would highly recommend aerogelic ballooning to my friends family and even my current boss who lives in glibert  he may actually be getting an aerogelic ballooning gift certificate from me this year for christmas  compared to other hot air balloon companies that operate in the phoenix area aerogelic offers a very personable experience  with smaller baskets than some of their competition aerogelic's balloon rides provide great visibility and tons of fun  i had the pleasure of meeting up with aerogelic's owner in albuquerque where he invited me to dine with his family and crew over breakfast after a morning flight  the crew is loyal knowledgeable and always strive for the best customer experience that can be provided
1,family celebrated my mother's 80th birthday with a balloon ride  we wanted to fly out of the east valley (chandlergilbert area)  aerogelic ballooning was the only one taking off in this area  they have a very safe flying record  shane's experience great stories and humor made this a wonderful flight  we thoroughly enjoyed our day and flight  would recommend shane and this company to anyone
1,there anything that brings smiles to peoples' faces better than a balloon my kids and i have been  watching balloons in the area for the last 4 years we consider living  in an area that is conducive to ballooning a definite plus  we have watched many many landings and i can only say that this crew makes it look easy obviously lots of experience and talent here top notch professionals   when i look around at those who come to see the landings everyone is happy laughing clapping smiling kids and adults alike want to see and touch the larger than life balloon  the crew is very kid-friendly we recently had the luxury of going on a flight and all i can say is awesome  i hope chandler is still a place for balloons in the future when my 2 young kids are grown
1,guys rock i took my whole family on a balloon ride for my mom's birthday we did the sunrise ride mid march the winds were too high on our original day and so we went the next day the team that helped us were very original and you could tell their love of flight they were friendly explained any questions that we had and took us on an excellent balloon adventure a great tradition and toast we had on a beautiful morning the estimated time that was given was spot on for total time to plan for this thank you for an awesome memory
1,boyfriend and i had a fantastic time up in the sky it was my xmas present and it was so much fun i thought i was going to be scared to death being lifted off the ground at 100 miles an hour and floating into things  that totally did not happen the balloon slowly lifted up and off we went the landing was also smooth with no complications although we were forewarn that it could be bumpy if the wind picked up  it was light and felt like i was on cloud 9 admiring the scenic beauty of our city and desert shane was extremely funny and my boyfriend got a kick out of his humori read a few of the negative reviews on here and i'd just like to say 8 passengers is not overcrowded at all for the smaller basket each pocket can easily fit two people that totaled 600lbs from my speculation my boyfriend and i totaled 370lbs and had plenty of room to move around so unless you are super obese i don't see an issue i would highly recommend them for an experience well done thanks
1,a great time shane and andy were funny knowledgeable and excellent pilots great anniversary present for my wife :) get a group of friends together and he may give you a good group rate ;) besides its more fun with friends
1,was amazingwhile everyone else was ballooning over the barren and bland desert we had an amazing experience over an area where we could see the city camelback and tons of cool vegetation and buildings our pilots were amazing and talked to is the whole time about ballooning and it's history as well as providing us tons of cool facts about arizona they were all very hilarious and friendly and made the experience def worth it got champagne and pastries after we landed at a scenic desert location also received certificates and champagne flutes got the trip on living social and went with family and friends paid $100 but looking back it would definitely been worth paying even twice that the guys we flew with were shane andy and seanthey were all very funny and knowledgable and were def an integral part of making the experience amazing
1,that i've only been on one ride i thought this one was good  this is way below my threshold of fun for the dollar but it was for my grandmother's 80th's bday and she really wanted to do it  overall this is one of the cheapest deals i've found  $130 per rider i believer  total of 12 in a basket  oh yeah 12 in a basket is alot  our guide was funny he was really skilled (he split 2 hills) and was very accommodating when it came to telling us about the balloon and how everything workedchampagne cheese and crackers at the end  with your yelp check in a free champagne glass etched with rainbow ryders  nice way to commemorate
1,might be an odd review because i didn't actually go on a ride with them but i want to give them a positive shout out for solid customer service  long story short i work in media as does my wife and we each did a story with them  they were very helpful and the customers i spoke with were very stoked on the ride and with them  that's part one  i was so impressed i bought a gift certificate with them for a present for my wife  we had bad luck such as super high winds (cancelled) and emergency surgery ( cancelled) then i had a job transfer out of the area  we were in a very unique situation and we were able to work it out and i just want to thank them  a solid group and businessif something goes awry i feel confident they will work with you  that's it
1,took an amazing sunset hot air balloon ride during the christmas holiday season the weather and view couldn't have been better we saw10 balloons go up with ustaylor our pilot was great and the ride was very smooth the champagne toast at the end was a wonderful touch
1,commander" dar was a great balloon pilot for our sunrise trip rainbow ryder's took care of everything from beginning to end on time on the ball it was even interesting to see how they figure out just the right launch point for our navigationless(ish) journey 12 people in a woven basket lifted and controlled via propane temperatures and breezescrazy we loved the peacefulness from above while even dipping down low (intentionally) to look for wildlife after our pretty smooth landing (i was expecting more impact but was pleasantly surprised) we had a nice continental breakfast with muffins bagels and scones catered by wildflower bread company very good the champagne orange juice and cranberry juice could be mixed or served solo as you prefer with comfortable opportunities for refills way to go rr
1,parents were visiting from oregon and since their birthdays were upcoming i bought them a sunrise ride over phoenixthey came back from their trip overjoyed they said it was an amazing experience and that their pilot was absolutely great they surely recommend this company and its toursthank you guys
1,trip highly recommend we did a private ride just the two of us for anniversary during sunset so beautiful and exciting by far our best anniversary yet thanks dar for a great ride
1,afraid of heights especially planes yet this was like nothing i've ever experienced  it was a smooth floating and so pleasant and the staff was so friendly and helpful that it made the whole experience something i'm so glad i just took the leap and did i took the kids 8 and 12 and they gave them certificates and pins as a reward for flying they let my son help put air in the balloon and had the three of us lay flat in the basket while they inflated it until it popped up it was so much fun -- safe and exhilarating at the same time i highly recommend this company
1,experience patrick was our pilot he was confident and funny jesse was our copilotloved it  i wouldn't fly with anyone else patrick also recommended a great detour for us on the way to sedona detour via prescott and then over the mountain to jerome   thanks we loved it
1,a wonderful experience wonderful ride great pilot and overall very much worth our money patrick was our pilot and he was very friendly and informative he managed to ease everyone who had concerns about heights we all had a wonderful flight from the carefree highway down to the deer valley airport it was nice to finish the whole thing off with champagne and breakfast i would definitely recommend to my friends and i hope to do it again someday
1,experience  we had al at the command and he was great in describing the mechanics of flight and making sure we all understood take off and landing  be prepared that it takes about 30-45 minutes to prepare for take off and another 30-45 at the end to pack up  very friendly  would definitely recommend
1,bought a balloon ride as a gift to my wife and we both loved it jon and his crew were very nice knowledgeable and experienced if we balloon again i would only use apex and highly recommend them
1,last minute trip to arizona seemed like an opportunity to check off an item that's been on my bucket-list namely a flight in a hot air balloon :) my journey started with a call to "2flyus" who was fully booked they referred us to apex with whom we originally planned to fly the morning after our arrival in phoenix however i ended up losing my bag with my laptop computer upon arrival at the airport and spent the wee hours of the morning trying to locate it this caused us to be late for our appointment with apex they did everything they could to make our situation less stressful while at the same time taking care of their other customers who had arrived on time they did this by calling in rollie from firebird balloons (which i also give 5 stars) while we didn't actually get to fly with apex i felt it important to put in a good word they made sure we were taken care of even though we were running very late for the flight while at the same time not neglecting their other customers and they did everything possible to eliminate the stress we were under the bottom line is they made sure that we were taken care of this is the mark of service excellence
1,experience   since this was my first experience with ballooning i don't have much by way of comparison but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves  my mother and i were in phoenix for a long weekend and a balloon ride was on her bucket list spoke to chad on the phone to make the reservation and he was easy to work with  there were six total passengers on our flight plus the pilot and we had plenty of room - not cramped at all  we were up in the air for about 75 minutes and had a smooth landing jon was great about pointing out sites around town and answering questions  would recommend apex to others
1,unforgettable  my husband and two kiddos went for our first balloon ride today for my husband's birthday  first off jon and chad were awesome  they are very knowledgeable and friendly  it's evident from the first moment that they love what they do and it shows  we happened to be the only ones on the flight due to it being so early in the season so it was very personable  our flight was amazingwe soared at 7000 feet captured some amazing views and saw some desert wildlife  our landing was the ultimate--it was flawless and we got to land in the street of a residential neighborhood  the icing on the cake was the champagne & juice celebratory toast at the end  jon is an exceptional pilot and if anyone was thinking of ballooning i would highly recommend them  you will love it
1,for my first ever balloon ride with john at apex and had a fabulous time  my husband and brother also were along and had a great time as well john was prompt professional and fun  will definitely do it again and highly recommend using apex
1,an amazing trip with these guys  total pro's who love what they do and it shows  highly recommend
1,am not a professional balloon passenger but i have been a passenger on one previous occasion (had a wonderful time) but apex balloon stands above the rest the balloon was the most tastefully decorated of the fleet the pilot and crew were knowledgable friendly & even creative the pilot brought bubbles in the basket and it was an instant hit;) i would recommend this company to anyone who wants to experience a superior company;)
1,stars  saturday like many other days a balloon flew over my son and daughter in law's house while we were enjoying the weather my sister and her husband were also with us and someone said "we need to do that"  that evening we were booked on an apex sunset flight for sunday  to say we had a blast would be an understatement  jon (owner and chief pilot) chad (pilot) and kenny (chase car driver) could not have made the experience more enjoyable for the 8 of us we even got in a little night flying very highly recommended
1,ballooning experience i've ever had i had been on a sunrise ride a couple years ago with hot air expeditions and decided it was a waste of my money and i never wanted to do it again fast forwardmy boyfriend had never been on a ride so i decided to book us a flight i found apex balloons and wasn't expecting to enjoy it after my first ride prior to this they blew my mind apex balloons and their crew were so great our pilot was jon and our crew chief was chad; they were both very friendly outgoing people who made our experience so fun and special we were able to enjoy a private sunset flight and a nice champagne toast with the crew after it was a beautiful experience and i'm so glad i found these guys i will be recommending this business to anyone that shows interest in ballooning thanks guys
1,and crew were top notch they are prompt well organized efficient personable competentmy wife and i had a wonderful experience we would highly recommend their service they all seem to go above and beyond wanting you to have the best of experiences jon the pilot is obviously gifted for this work it seems like a calling for him
1,it was a bit scary to me but once i got used to being up in the air it was a breeze (pun not intended)  i booked the flight for myself and hubs and for a moment it looked as if it wasn't going to happen due to rain coming into phoenix  of all the times  we were called and asked if we wanted to change the date but we couldn't so it was left to see if the original date and weather would cooperate  they didkevin is a hoot which made for a great ride  very professional but also fun which helped when i was still nervous  he explained many things about ballooning and its history and what things we were floating over (beware the jumping cholla cactus) and even told us there was an app for wind currents (which proves there is an app for every thing) our ride was a sunrise one and it was amazing to see the sun come over the mountains and watch the other balloons that were also flying that day to inflate and rise but our ride rocked as his will only carry up to 4 people plus him unlike the others which looked like egg crates full of people - they can carry up to 14 at a time some of them as it turned out it was just us and kevin so it was fantastic  seeing the world from 5000 feet in the air in a basket is something else  if you want an experience to cross off your bucket list or for a special occasion - i highly recommend kevin  you will not regret it and like me will want to do it again
1,fun worth ever penny the views were amazing and we loved the feeling of floating in the air and seeing all over phoenix however the best part of this company is that the balloon only holds 4 people (plus the pilot) vs 14 people in other companies it felt like we had our own private tour of the desert  it ended up to be just me & my husband we felt so lucky  the owner kevin is also the pilot so he was really invested in making sure we had an amazing flight this did my disappoint  highly recommend
1,boyfriend surprised me with a hot air balloon ride for my 25th birthday last week kevin and his partner were vibrant hosts and were both very knowledgeable about flying i thought i would be a little nervous but the ride was smooth and these guys are obviously pros which put me at ease kevin knew the lay of the land well and served as an excellent tour guide the champagne toast at the end was a perfect treat at the end of our flight i would definitely recommend taking a trip with kevin the other balloons we saw taking off around us were carrying 8-14 people each and our little basket held two couples and kevin i'm very glad my boyfriend booked with 2 fly us because we had a more intimate trip--the other couple on our flight was lovely two notes: be prepared to wake up early and the flame for the balloon is hot i regretted wearing a nice top because i definitely sweated through it goes for any hot air balloon flight but thought it was worth mentioning
1,took a flight with kevin on new years eve  what a great way to end the year  i would highly recommend 2 fly us  kevin made this a great day for us  my wife was a little apprehensive about the flight but kevin helped make it enjoyable  we started out staying rather low so we all became comfortable with flying  this was a first trip for everyone in the basket  we worked up to 4000 feet but found flying at the lower heights to be more interestingthere are several companies that offer flights  many of them have baskets that hold 8 to 14 people  i would recommend using a company with smaller baskets  ( 4 people plus pilot) we like the smaller more personal flight  thanks to kevin and chaser gene for a great experience
1,and glen were spectacular  i bought my friend a ride for her birthday and she was gracious enough to bring me along  it was totally worth it  the crew was very friendly and extremely knowledgable on hot air balloons  i was a bit nervous but it was all put to ease because these guys were entertaining and professional  if i get up the gumption to do this again i will definitely go with these guys the four person balloon seemed much nicer than those larger balloons considering it was just me and my friend going  we met a very nice couple too that joined us in the balloon  kevin's stories were great and he knew so much  definitely give these guys a try it's worth every penny
1,wife and i have had the opportunity to ride in a hot air balloon a couple of time before out in california wine country and really enjoyed it so when we were looking for something special to do on valentines day this caught my eye especially since kevin offers a sunset flight (all our other flights were sunrise crack of dawn affairs where you have to get up at 4 am)what makes this company a standout is that it is small-just one guy kevin and he only takes 4 people per trip which is so much nicer than the other flights we've been on with 12 or 16  kevin is the best host and he's got great stories to tell having flown balloons for over 30 years all over the world (be sure to ask him about curt russel and goldie hawn in aspen)we met up about 3:45 pm at the dunkin donuts rendezvous point and were driven to the launch site-a big open field of state land  as it was valentines day there was a bevy of other balloons with the same plan (the ballon guys are all like one big family) all spread out inflating around the same time but we were the only one of the 15 that wasn't 12 or 16 or even 23 people  it was great to see all the balloons getting ready and we were one of the first away some with the larger crowds were as much as 30 minutes late but all have to be down by sunset (around 630 this time of year)the flight was around an hour then ended with the traditional toast with sparkling wine and he even provided some chocolates as well  the ride itself was great with kevin deftly maneuvering the balloon  highly recommended
1,of us took this hot air balloon ride before sun set for my friend's 50th birthday it was affordable compared to other companies but the basket was a little small we felt like the red hot burner was very close to our heads especially when he had to juice it to make hot air but the experience was wonderful  kevin was so funny and entertaining  he was very competent and experienced which put all of us at ease especially two people on our flight who are a bit afraid of heights  his crew was courteous friendly and enthusiastic  after the flight we had champaigne and cavier (he allowed me to bring my own as it was a special bottle) kevin took great photos for us too
1,love you float for a scaredy cat like me i wasn't terribly keen on the idea of a hot air balloon ride but you guys made it awesome for me everyone made my experience so enjoyable the food was great they focused on me having the best time that i could and the amount of people on it was perfect i would definitely do this again but i wouldn't use anyone else you guys are awesome
1,two sisters and i wanted to take our mom and dad on a hot air balloon ride for their anniversary and my dad's birthday we had emailed a few of the well known companies in the area and matt at float got back to us first we were glad to hear they had a balloon to fit us 5 plus the pilot as we wanted it to be a more personal experience our pilot peggy was fantastic as was her crew help patwe all agreed it was a great experience but the most notable part came when we arrived back home and my mom realized she lost three $100 bills from her pocket (she had similarly lost lottery tickets from her jacket the day before) i emailed matt to see if he could check the back of the van and he responded immediately that he would have pat check sure enough the money was in the back of the van and he called me back to let me know and to properly get it back to ussuch an honest and classy thing to do and my mom was so relieved (albeit embarrassed) overall it was a really nice experience and in good company we'd definitely recommend
1,put together half day excursion great food at the end awesomely picnic spread champagne toast and beautiful sights owned and operated by a young couple both very spunky and charismatic you won't be disappointed
1,amazing their pilot was incredibly interesting and informative their food was amazing and the flight was so beautiful their hospitality was only upstaged by how beautiful the ride was
1,am a 3rd generation arizonan and seeing hot air balloons rise up from the desert has been a memory since i can remember 31 years into my life i was finally able to experience balloon flight and i can tell you how incredibly glad i selected float matt olivia and their team provided a one of a kind experience not just in the hot air balloon but before and after from the moment you arrive to fresh cartel coffee to a seasonally & local curated breakfast and champagne when you land there's no question that i'll be coming back to float with friends and family in the future thank you tremendously
1,experience overall this was my first time riding on one and i can say i had a really good time the pilot's are great and know how to keep the group entertained the people i rode with were a pleasure to have on the ride aswell the meal after the ride was sooo good it was a nice way to wrap up the ride i will definitely recommend to friends and family
1,girlfriend and i took a balloon flight with float for our anniversary a couple of weeks ago both of us had never been on a hot air balloon before we flew out early on a sunday when we got to the meeting site we were immediately greeted with friendly smiling faces and fresh coffee from a local shop in the area as we had our morning coffee the pilot went over our flight plan and safety measures we felt incredibly comfortable and excited after that we got in the float van and took a beautiful drive through the desert during the sunrise in route to the launch site while the crew was setting up the balloon they let us help or take as many pictures as we wanted i got a sweet time lapse video of the balloon inflating after we took off the flight was incredibly smooth the pilot explained everywhere we passed over and also told us hilarious stories about previous flights my girlfriend brought her go pro with her and we all had fun passing it around the balloon to get good shots when we landed we were greeted by matt and olivia with a huge brunch made from local ingredients and prepared by a local chef before digging in the pilot told us about the history of hot air ballooning and taught us about the custom of toasting the ride we all toasted to our first balloon experience with hand picked freshly squeezed apple cider mimosas and then had the most delicious brunch overall i'd say this was one of the best experiences i've ever had and i would recommend this to everyone the float crew made the experience much more exciting than i had expected and added so much more than "just a balloon ride" it was a perfect anniversary for my girlfriend and i matt the owner even gave a toast to us i would recommend float to anyone who hasn't flown in a balloon before anyone visiting the phoenix area and any locals who want to do something exciting and out of the ordinary in their own backyard it truly was so much more than just a balloon ride we plan to fly again as soon as we get back to phoenix
1,far best time i've had in a while fantastic beautiful balloon ride gourmet field-cooked breakfast great small-business owners do it
1,friends and i had so much fun on this tour the owners were great the pilot was experienced (and hilarious) and the locally obtained breakfast with champagne toast was amazing i would definitely recommend float to anyone wanting to take a tour and i wouldn't go to a different company if i were to go again
1,always a little nervous going to places like this the same reason i love them--they are geared towards the immigrant community--can also lead to stares that never cease throughout one's meal as the rest of the crowd tries to figure out if you are part of the community somehow and if not why did you comewhen my friend and i first walked in to cafe sarajevo the record skidded off the player so to speak all the middle-aged bosnian men smoking at the bar turned around as did the crew of bosnian teens thankfully the owner quickly saw our timid looks and came over with a big smile and a lot of information and recommendations about bosnian cuisine the stares stopped i ordered an excellent chicken sandwich on this incredibly thick rich bosnian bread called lepinja while i tried some pretty good bosnian soda the portions were huge bosnian television played the whole time for desert most of the selections available were classical french pastry in addition to the amazing food the small cafe also includes a small selection of imported bosnian goods for purchase bosnian food is hard to find even in the new yorks and la's of the world so take full advantage
1,dated this gypsy con artist chick for awhile who was from bosnia she took me here a few times and pretty much blew my mind i had never had anything quite like it and she assured me it was authentic from what i understand you would be hard-pressed to find anything so authentic anywhere else in the us she even knew the owner (at least i think she was the owner) pretty well as a tiny grocery store they have some really fantastic items that i've never found elsewhere from candy to cured meats it's all pretty impressive as a restaurant the food is great it's all very rich and pretty accessible for american palates they serve turkish coffee which is this pretty amazing mudambiance here is a little third world but that's part of the experience i felt pretty welcome but i was being escorted by an insider i have found it a little intimidating to return by myself (plus it's just really kinda far) but as friendly as they are i can't imagine i'd be beaten and dragged into the back or anything though i don't know why i just thought of that as a possibility hmm i guess it's cuz there's a bit of a mafia vibe here i can't explain it
1,couple of nights ago a friend & i were looking for a place to have dinner so i headed for yelp  looked in my friend's neighborhood and found sarajevo  saw good reviews so that's where we went since neither one of us had ever had bosnian food  good callwhen we walked in we noticed that we appeared to be the only non-bosnian people there  this little nondescript hole-in-the-wall only seats about 20 people  our waiter patiently explained the menu and made what turned out to be *excellent* suggestions  however the portions were so big we both took boxes of leftovers homethey weren't busy so we're a little nervous -- we want this place to succeed because we want to keep going back for morei've already recommended sarajevo to some friendsupdate:   my latest visit (last night) i had the gyro sammich  serious yumthis time we we the only customers in the place  the food is soooo good and the people are so nice why aren't you yelpers doing your part  ;-)go there  fill this place up  eat  enjoyi have selfish reasons for wanting this sarajevo cafe to be full of customers  no i don't own a piece of it  i like the food and i want to know that it's doing well so i will know that it's there  this is seriously good food people  your stomach will tell you that i told you the truth
1,need not apply; the only salad you will find here is a pile of grilled onions  seriously this place is comfort food heaven  i ordered a chicken sandwich a large cevapi (which i can only think means "delicious spicy meat fingers" in bosnian) sandwich a cheese pita and a spinach pita  i can't really put my finger on what makes the food so good other than it's straight up comfort food that sticks to your ribs and makes you wish all pants came with elastic waistbandsthe restaurant itself is out of this world; no seriously it's like walking into some small bosnian hole-in-the-wall  what it lacks in amenities it makes up in character; you've got soccer playing on the tv and this 70's eastern european techno playing in the background while a bunch of men chat away in the back of the shop  the best way to describe it is star wars cantina scene meets national geographic  don't worry about feeling like an outsider nobody pays attention to the confused and worried look on your face unless it's the gracious and friendly host  ;)anyway back to the food  the chicken sandwich was perfectly seasoned and cooked while the meaty bosnian sausages put jimmy dean and his family to shame  i recommend using the kobayashi method on these dishes; meat first bread second  oh and don't forget to ask for some ajvar (tart red-pepper sauce) to dress your sausages with  the bread shouldn't be ignored though since it is thick rich and hearty  the pitas are not pitas in the middle-easterngreek sense they're more like stuffed fillo pies and they're just as delicious as the rest of the entrees  by the way the portions are quite large and make a hungry man frozen dinner look (and taste) like a mcd's happy meal  actually if mcd could make their mcnuggets even remotely taste like sarajevo's cevapi they would rule the worldin all seriousness though this is simply awesome comfort food at an uber affordable price  although i must admit that i was so in love with my plate that i may have snarled and showed my teeth to innocent bystanders who got too close  regardless i definitely recommend this place if you want to try something (as cheech and chong would say) that's the same as your favorite comfort food but different  i would write more but the food coma has completely taken me overpost scriptum:  i believe my stomach just did a happy dance and passed out
1,on the front window is a gigantic painting of the bosnian sausage sandwich and it deserves the place of honor this is a casual hole in the wall with a small grocery section in the back everything we tried was delicious my husband had the bosnian sausage sandwich and a cheese pita i had a meat pita and bean soup my daughter had a plain gyro which she pronounced as the best gyro she's ever had the sausage sandwich and the gyro came on a wonderful fluffy bread that appeared to have been browned on a grill next time we go i'm definitely ordering extra bread the pitas are not the flat bread sandwiches that you might be expecting instead they are made with a flaky pastry like filo the filling is wrapped in the pastry and twisted in an oblong spiral shape for dessert i had baklava which seemed to have even more honey sauce and nut filling than most - very tastyour server was very friendly and explained the whole menu to us the atmosphere is homey and there is a notable sense of community that gives you a wonderful taste of bosnian culture
1,food i've been in love with bosnian food since 2008 when i visited the country and i was not disappointed at all it's definitely an immigrant restaurant and any non-bosnians might feel a but strange at first but the waiter is super friendly and very welcoming definitely check this place out if you are in the mood for something authentic and for all you posters out that made comments about not finding bosnian products or authentic restaurants in ny or la that's because you aren't looking in the right city st louis is home to the largest population of bosnians outside of bosnia checkout the bevo mill area for a large selection of bosnian restauarants and markets
1,cevapi's i come here once a week great service great food
1,entering i was greeted warmly with "dobar dan" (good day) i felt taken to another place what an amazing restaurant the cevapi is perfect and i will be going back often for bosnian coffee authentic ambient clean quick friendly and delicious
1,must try this place it is wonderful we shared the zeljanica (spinach spankopita thingy) and the sausage sandwich both were amazing we also had turkish coffee it blew my mind i was so pleased by the way it was served that's how it should be done i keep meaning to get back soon and savor another turkish coffee and a zeljanica all by myself because i don't want to have to share
1,bosnian food excellent friendly service i love this place
1,is absolutely my favorite restaurant in montreal i have been twice now and both times were exceptional for a fixed price you get an appetizer soup unlimited bread entree dessert and coffee the prices are beyond reasonable for the amount of (amazing) food that you you get food is as good as or better than anything i've had in bostonnyc without the rip-off factorboth times i had the flank steak which comes with sauteed green beans and these hashbrown-like crispy potatoes that are to die for i've also had their mushroom soup and regular dinner salad (which is loaded with figs and some fun cheeses) and both were awesome the one thing not to miss however is the raclette ask for extra peppercorns you will not be disappointed i know few things better than a slab of baked melted cheese on a plate it's served with a side of gherkin pickles which sounds strange but the combination is really incredible i have also had tried their creme brulee and chocolate torte both fantastic it's byob which of course always helps keep our wallets happy and they never judge for bringing a bottle per person :)  the services is always over the top as well their menu is in french only however staff are always helpful with the translation the ambiance is beautiful too; it's a small neighborhood joint that is near downtown but not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of everything it's quiet and outdoor seating is available in summer (and its really cute) definitely check this place out; i will definitely be back next time i am in montreal
1,was a very pleasant experience on a thursday evening  we had the rachlette for two just the right amount of food and very nice on a cool summer evening  bring your own wine; nice patio and quiet
1,quiet place with fantastic service and food  all the recommendations were spot on  definitely need to come back again  had the raclette as appetizer and perfectly cooked liver yum
1,place was phenomenal had to take a cab from montreal centre  to get there but also accessible by metro  they speak great english and are very helpful with the menu (they do have an english menu)  we were there to celebrate a 40th birthday for dinner  food was outstanding  great ambience and staff extremely friendly and accommodating  we ordered the raclette  which was divine  best meal we had while visiting montreal being able to bring our own wine also made it very affordable  love this place and would highly recommend it
1,on a weekend get-away we found ourselves at opus hotel at the corner of st laurent and sherbrooke opus was a travel + leisure favorite and they should reconsider -- the staff was uneven: from the ice queen at reception to wonderful accommodating valets it's clear that the hotel once shone but now it's scuffed and ratting at the edgesbut this is about cafeteria thankfully the waitstaff at cafeteria was warm and attentive and the breakfast was well-priced tasty and well presented warm crepes with a plentiful serving of maple syrup classic montreal bagels and a generous serving of fresh beautiful fruitoh and treat yourself to a bowl of cafe au lait a glorious way to start any day
1,just spent a weekend in montreal and had a completely different experience than the majority of the reviewers here  i did not try their breakfast (although i did stop by during lunchtime one day and it was packed) but i did have dinner here on a thursday night and spent a good part of friday night at the bar  what i found was the most friendly welcoming environment that i experienced in montreal  i'm from austin tx and we have a laid back 'let's all have fun' attitude and it was very comfortable to be at cafeteria  from the owner to the manager to the waitstaff this place amazed me with the level of friendly genuine service they displayedthe pasta dish that i had on thursday was very good  a light butter and oil sauce over linguini with fresh mozzarella basil and tomato  the owner sat next to me and the dish looked so good i had to order it  i did and the ladies next to me (a motherdaughter duo out for a drink before planning to get sushi) tried my dish and changed their plans  they also ordered the pasta and decided to stay there for dinner versus going to get sushithe bartenders were awesome and the vibe was great  cool people but also some hipsters  beautiful crowd on friday night  really cool and gorgeous people everywherei absolutely loved this restaurantbar  loved it  felt at home every second i was there which says something for a texan in montreal that doesn't speak a lick of french  they were kind and generous and fun and served up the perfect ambience meal and drinks while i was there  i would strongly encourage you to try this restaurant but also to take the time to say hello to the folks that work there  they were awesome  super cool place  cheers cafeteriajosh from texas
1,love this restaurant - one of those great little secret places that i always enjoy being it has a very montreal atmosphere (lots of black cool music comfortable seats) and great food it's not large but you can usually find a seat it's also one of my favorite afternoon meeting places right on blvd st laurent it's a convenient place to meet with colleagues and have an amazing coffee or a beer  in warmer weather you can sit in the window and watch the street go by  week-end brunch is good too love the little sausages  highly highly recommended
1,calling about 10 places at 9pm on a saturday night trying to get reservations for 9 people an hour and a half later le continental was the first place to hook us up with a large ad hoc reservationsome of us arrived earlier than others so we could savor a drink first - my friends were happy with the staff's wine suggestions and i thoroughly enjoyed my cosmopolitansince none of the 9 of us spoke a lick of french receiving a french menu in a french restaurant we were trying to discern what exactly it was we were looking at in terms of food  the handsome good-natured waiters brought us out some english menus and though people ordered a wide variety of food items - the lamb the duck the steak frites the flank steak apps of calamari figs and beef carpaccio all of us were extremely pleased with how tasty everything was as well as how reasonably priced it all was (save for the canadian tax which is shockingly high so it winds up evening out to still solid american pricing)  we all split up desserts - i had one of the largest creme brulees i've ever seen and some other folks got the house layer dessert  we ate dinner from 10:30pm until 1:00am never felt rushed and the best part was that they had already split up the check for our large party even with distinctions of half-desserts on each bill for those of us who had split themle continental may not have been the first place we called or even that 9th but my cosmo flank steak and creme brulee were all extremely delicious and even after tax and tip i only had to shell out $42 canadian at this ritzy jamhighly recommend to anyone touting around montreal - they were great to our large party - accommodating sweet and the food was totally worth it
1, went to this place because we didn't make it for our reservation at au pied de cochon saturday night traffic in montreal was really bad coming from vieux port de montreal after cirque du soleil show on the other hand the restaurant is not within walking distance from our hotel le centre sheraton it was 12:15 when we arrived at east duluth and au pied de cochon kitchen closed at 12am we found that the only restaurant that still open was continental bistro both of us don't speak french but our waiter was friendly and spoke english well i ordered duck confit (one of my favorite) and my friend ordered lamb shank both of them were delicious for desert we ordered desert du jour to share it was raspberry and white chocolate tart we ate at two different french restaurant and this one was the best unfortunately they don't open for lunch i want to order duck confit again before i leave i highly recommend this restaurant surprisingly not many people write review about this place
1,wife and i had a great time there the food was extremely delicious and the service was very nice as well
1,favorite french restaurant in the world beef flanksteak is amazing as well as all the appetizers
1, people here were very nice and accomodating  the food was delicious- we tried a bunch of appetizers including beef carpacchio scallops escargot and fig carpacchio which were all amazing  the seafood was super fresh and everything was just executed perfectly  the entrees were even better than the appetizers which is really a rarity with nice restaurants  we had the papardelle with beef cheeks which was sooo good- the pasta was perfectly al dente and beef cheeks were so tender  the duck confit was crispy and delicious with amazing flavors  wine was really reasonably priced as well  overall loved this place
1,often forget how big of a fan i am of this place until some random thursday night when i'm looking for a classic place to eat something fresh and guaranteed yummy then i remember of all those late night after work snacks i've had and enjoyed therethis is the perfect little bistro well located cute setup and funaffordable wines for you to try i think they've narrowed down their food menu lately but the good news is they  kept the best dishesso the beef carpaccio with manchego and the salmon tartar with avocado puree are great but make sure you order the fig carpaccio served hot with goat cheese and the most amazing creamy pesto and balsamic sauce ever everything on the menu will be good but keep your focus on the fig carpaccio - it will be amazingi will admit that the bill can get a little high but the food is delicious and worth it plus they're open late and have a cute (yet tight) terrace you should go'
1,be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place tucked down a flight of steps just off george street but in my opinion that's half of it's charm it's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality not because it's in your faceit's easy to see why when you step inside it's like being on some sort of japanese garden terrace with the green leafy plants and water feature rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it next to the fresh flowers and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusivealthough it's never going to make the top 10 list of cheapest places in edinburgh you do get what you pay for that said at the moment all of the montpeliers venues have their "better by half" promos on: glasses of house wine selected cocktails selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment i've been making the most of these offers every time i'm out for fear that they might finish soon but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet happy daysi've only ever drunk here but one of these days i will be going for food the plates i've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous there are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof
1,the last 6 months ricks has definitely had a good shake up and after my fantastic experience last week i think things can only get better the bar team are innovative and original and during a busy friday night shift never failed to impress me as i worked my way through the new cocktail list and the bar snacks were unique and delicious the dj provides a funky relaxed atmosphere and gradually builds up the beats to get you in that weekend mood i will be back again and again and will be taking all my friends too i recommend a passionfruit frozen margarita or 'busy with the fizzy' strawberry soda stream cocktail just fab
1,always consistent great foodi recommend the duck and the calamari one of my favourite places in the city
1,was blown away by iris when we visited thistle street is one of my favourite eating and drinking districts in edinburgh and this place only served to increase my adorationoverall we said: "iris offers extremely high quality food in swish surroundings with excellent friendly knowledgeable service the only other person i've heard extolling its virtues is ardent yelper jurgen who is a great fan of the place i'd like to confirm that i will be joining jurgen's chorus of appreciation as the place is something really very special it shines bright in a street of precious edinburgh jewels i'd suggest you pay it a visit soon you will be richly rewarded"
1,michelin starred restaurant with friendly service and wonderful food get a seat near the window where you can watch the chefs do their stufftom kitchin isn't afraid to be adventurous in his mixes of flavours which often delivers a whole new taste treat but (on the rare occasion) strikes an odd discordant note on the palatelocal produce always fresh especially fish
1,may have seen this restaurant on anthony bourdain's tv show its excellent period probably the best all around restaurant in the city- have heard somewhere that it may be closing but i cannot believe that the chef and owner tom kitchen is simply perfection great atmosphere and a fresh and changing menuit aint cheap remotely the best approach is to eat here for lunch during the week for a set price meal it doesnt matter what its being served as everything will be in your top 3 of whatever genre of food youre getting near lots of barsshops ocean terminal if youre up for a bad mall after
1,is one of the best 1-star michelin restaurant i have been to it's a full experience food and watching the cooks at work there is indeed a big window into the kitchen that lets everyone see what's going on and grasp the electrical atmosphere in the cooking chamber the table are organised so that most people can peep in during their meal and appreciate the effort put into their food it's really cool to see tom kitchen put the final touches to your plate :)) it just makes the whole thing more excitingthe food itself is wonderful really incredibly fresh and tasty seasonal and imaginative we went for lunch and the 30-ish pound menu is cheap compared to the quality of the food quite a treat if you take some wine but nonetheless worthwhile and to be remembered i started with a pistachio rabbit & foie gras terrine with an onion tatin just amazing then i had pork cheeks cooked like a "blanquette" with a white sauce mushrooms carrots new potatoes delicious the meat was so tender then i had the rhubarb-themed dessert: rhubarb fresh soup with poached pieces of rhubarb rhubarb sorbet caramel croquante pannacotta i really really liked it so yummy and we had the traditional petit-fours after that yumthe restaurant is a little remote and far from the city centre but it's ok it's just in front of the scottish government building quite surreal actually
1,would say at a push my favourite restaurant in edinburgh when you can afford it :) been for dinner and lunch and both times it was first class it's not an overly fussy place considering the michelin star but focuses very much on the quality of ingredients with the dishes being far more simplistic than say 21212 this is to its credit however and mr kitchin thoroughly deserves his recent title of best restaurant in scotlandif it's on the menu the turbot with sea snails was stunning and one of the most memorable dishes i've eaten if you don't fancy forking out for the a la carte or tasting menu the set lunch is excellently priced and provides close to the kitchin experience whilst putting a smaller dent in ones purse
1,take great care of you from the start and by the start i mean enquiring about seating by email the hostess is prompt and complete with replies letting me know which nights are fully booked and advising me about better days to come in i came here for lunch since all the dinners were booked up and had the prix fixe 3-course lunch really a steal in my opinionthe waiting staff worked as a great team so we didn't feel ignored even when our server was helping someone else as there were many other friendly staff checking on each other's clientele i loved having sweet potato chips at the table to crunch on when we entered and the selection of bread from a wheeled up bread cart with selections such as freshly baked sourdough and olive breadmy starter was the octopus carpaccio which was fabulously laid out and accompanied with colourful pickled vegetables the main was the ox cheek which was so delicate that no knife was necessary dessert was a chocolate pistachio souffle which was very creative and interesting not too heavy but nice and warm with a great flavourthe hosts took care of calling our taxi as we exited to proceed with our day after with hunger satisfied and tastebuds delighted
1,kitchin blew me away the dining room was elegant but still bright service was very friendly except for the french staff who were sterile and highly efficient yet still professional as can only expected from a french server the most refreshing part of kitchin was actually seeing tom kitchin in the kitchen with his hands in the food; there is a small window that allows you to see into the kitchen from the dining room it is becoming increasingly rare to see a chef in the restaurant that his name on it veg crisp were giving as snack a great selection of bread was also served the amuse bouche of pumpkin soup with crunch pumpkin seed in it was very wintery and was more than just one small bite  i was a bit weary of the pig's head and langoustine because i was not sure how the langoustine could add to this dish trust me something would be missing it wasn't on the plate the pig's head was boned and rolled and had a great earthy spice to it my main of venison was cooked perfectly and had seven components on the dish any time i see many components on the dish i get nervous but kitchin surprised me again this was a pretty hardy winter dish for a restaurant in this category (i left really full) my desert was simply titled chocolate and features mall souflee ice cream and blood orange marmalade the made everything else taste so much better when i told the staff i was from boston i was invited into the kitchen to meet chef kitchin and he also signed a copy of his cookbook for me this guy seems really down to earth my 55 review is based off the food i ate and not that i met the chef
1,glad i came here with my family i am not a big fan of haute cuisine anymore too much showing off and combining of strange flavours for me so i was a bit apprehensivethe kitchen shows that you can take cooking to a higher level using local ingredients keep the flavours individual and still have michelin star foodi thought the costs were very competitive for the quality and would highly recommend anyone going for any occasion
1,are as of right now three items that stick out to me that have eaten as the most memorable three things  one was here at the kitchin  my wife and i recently visited edinburgh and this was the best meal we ate  two start i had the bone marrow i love bone marrow and would swim in it like scrooge mcduck swims in money if i could this marrow was much less traditional than the ones i have had in nyc  it had snails bacon and a quail egg on top it was fantastic  for my main course i had mutton the dish came with a small side of braised shoulder meat it was fantastic and i wish i was eating right now the main part of the dish was very good too just not as memorable  it is worth the schlep to leith to eat here for sure
1,crap this place is awesomefood wine service (even the french staff) - all fantasticdid the tasting menu with matching wine and we were happily stuffed full of food and rolled to a waiting taxi (after meeting tom) at the end of the night small things like a map from where in the country produce was sourced and a copy of the tasting menu itself were nice little touches which weren't required but definitely welcomeddefinitely coming back
1,kitchin is a must if you are in edinburgh having seen kitchin on masterchef i was intrigued everything on his menu is sourced from scotland and they even bring you a little map of scotland in the beginning showing where the ingredients were from presentation and food were beautiful - full of color and much thought to the dishes fortunately it was grouse season when i was visiting (october 2013) so i tried it for the first time as my main dish it was fantastic- cooked perfectly and juicy i don't know if i've ever had anything better the ceps starter was amazing as well - perfectly seasoned to bring out the taste of the mushroom the berry tart dessert was a great way to end the meal the best part was at the end when tom himself came out to introduce himself to us even though he's become well known he really seems like a down to earth kinda guy the whole time i also noticed he was in the kitchen with food preparation and making sure everything was perfect i wouldn't hesitate to return i had an outstanding experience
1,care center gave me back my life  i have been here over a year and plan on going home soon i have received great care from my doctors nurses and the staff here the physical therapy folks are the best  god bless you and thanks tlc 
1,mother has been at four different rehab centers in las vegas over the past 1 12 yearsand for the last several months we have been at tlc we could not be happier with the service staff and environment there is always a doctor on staff which is very hard to find in a rehabthe nurses are very knowledgeable courteous and attentiveand have been dedicated to giving my mother consistent attention i would highly recommend this facility to anyone who deeply cares about where their loved one is placed we can't be grateful and thankful enough
1,you need rehab this is a great place to go friendly staff that know what they are doing  they helped me get full movement back after hand surgery and now i'm going to see them for another injury  they work with all kinds of athletes and injuries there is always a lot going on in the building but they manage to treat all of their clients in a timely  manner and have great customer service
1,is a gym goer's gym  serious people only; not your fufu trying to pick up on someone i can't get away from looking at the mirror hey what's your name gymyou need to get your "donkey" back in shape you come to rehab plus  no bull  warren and his boys will get you working and performing at a new level  i got killed climbing the ropes  i didn't think much of it but how dare i underestimated it  my arms were so weak and tired in the end  my handswell let's just say calling them raw is an understatement  i don't recall how many times i climbed that rope and did pull-ups but yeah it was hell of a workout  that was just my first time too  can't wait to go backhahahaha  i laugh because i just realize how ridiculous this is  here i come tough mudder  the gym doesn't have all the high tech equipment  you want that; go to a gym where they offer manicures  suck it up and welcome to hell  basic equipment but very innovative technics and training  they have an artificial turf area and a free weights room where looking at it makes you feel a lot bigger  are those really my biceps -- wink
1,your new to exercise and want to learn the safeproper ways to get involved or a bonafied "gym rat" it doesn't matter simply put rehab plus is the place to go in order to not only reach your fitness goals the right way but obtain the knowledge and motivation to surpass them rehab plus is not the huge corporate gym with run of the mill trainers only interested in hitting on chicks and making money every staff member not only has the education but the passion and interest in exercisefitness you want to from your trainer to keep your workouts fresh interesting and the body improving its not just for the adults either if you want to get your kid off the couch or give your young athlete that serious leg up on the competition rehab plus will take them to that next level with fun and fresh workouts rehab plus has all the equipment you could wantneed to get that amazing and unique workout in climbing rope weight sled artificial turf area kettle balls you name it in my opinion its not the equipment that makes the work out it's the knowledge and creativity of the trainer i workout in some form 6 days a week (1 if which  rehab plus) and the only day i consistently get that "good" soreness is when i go see my boy dan at sports rehab he always has new and challenging exercises that keeps my body guessing and avoiding that dreaded plateau effect not only that but the exercises i learn at rehab plus allow me to keep my own workouts fresh and interestingnot to worry dan isn't the only trainer at rehab plus he's just one of the amazing trainers there and they all have their own areas of expertise from former nfl players and strength coaches to elite level swim coaches sports rehab has a trainerprogram for everyone it doesn't matter if your 50 trying to get that 30 firmness back or want to get your young athlete to the next level rehab plus knows how to do it right the abundance and range of expertise of the trainers at rehab plus would even allow you to go in there with your kid and both get a workout in at the same time i don't think any other gym could offer thatit doesn't stop at the exercisefitness level rehab plus is also sports physical therapy center that isn't just worried about the minimum dedicated to getting the athlete back on the field court board slopes whatever your sport they have the education and put their knowledge to use when it comes to getting you back to your top performing levels i only wish i had a place like when rehabbing my torn knee i will definitely use rehab plus for any services they can offer me in training or rehabbing injuries
1,tried rehab plus out after injuring my shoulder and i really can't say enough great things about the place and staff  throughout my baseball career including: high school collegiate and semi-professional i thought that i had experienced what i thought was some of the best rehabilitation and training in the country but after visiting rehab plus i was wrong  from the first time i went in to the last time the staff was very knowledgeable and very supportive in helping me get back to full form  the trainers and physical therapists at rehab plus are second to none  after only about five sessions of doing unique strength rehab and stretching exercises i had already felt ten times better  being an athlete my whole life i have always been a huge believer in positive thinking and having a proactive attitude  i can tell you first hand that the personnel at rehab plus share this fundamental belief  the atmosphere at rehab plus is very supportive and positive created by the trainers physical therapists and residual staff  a couple of things that give rehab plus an edge over similar places is that the personnel are progressive and are so well versed in their areas of expertise  many places i've been to in the past are stuck on old philosophies that don't get optimal results  rehab plus strives to be the best by catering to the needs of their clients such as: rehabilitation sports performance strength and conditioning and much more
1,want to learn the deadlift with proper form for the fun of it today i had an almost two hour evaluation and preliminary training with ethan tonight i have early onset rigor mortis (and we still haven't touched a bar) i'm so impressed i can barely stand it yesterday i questioned if i'd ever deadlift 400 pounds at age 54 with very little experience under my belt today that 400 pound dead-lift is in my sites ethan's training experience  knowledge and encouragement are awesomenow i know why putting down the bottles to pick up the barbells would be worth it sober people can get really strongi've watched a lot of free training on youtube and from other online resources but the connection between the mind and the muscles when the trainer is right there is incomparable in valuei've got a lot of work these next four weeks before my next visit
1,place is great smart effective physical therapy they are seasoned sports minded therapist they're focused on service and getting you back to the level of activity that's important to yousad to say i've seen a lot of pt over the years the atmosphere here is the best it has a very down to earth professional vibe it's all about recovery my doctor recommended i go to rehab associated with his practice but it seemed too sterile a friend recommended rehab plus for his successful recovery from knee and it band problems my hip and knee arthritis was keeping me off the court and day to day activities were painful my therapy regimen included basic strengthening and sport specific exercises that improved my gamesomeone's with you at all times to ensure you're doing the right thing working with proper form they're attentive enthusiastic and patienti highly recommend rehab plus
1,card health card sheriff card gaming card green card and a visa card to pay for all the other cards i'm getting carded to death but all this cards are required by law at my work so there's no way out  there are about 3 or 4 certified schools in nevada where you can obtain this card you have to attend the three to four hour class depending on the school and pay the 20 to 40 dollar fee again depending on the school by far this is the best place to obtain the card the instructor is very knowledgeable on the subject and very understanding with the students the price of the card is only 2000 dollars the class is very easy and the only way not to pass the class is if you come to the class drunk and that would be funny  because that would mean that you needed the class the most you will learn that drinking alcohol causes drunkenness and will receive a card to prove that you actually know that the hardest part would be to stay awake
1,is the nicest funniest sweetest guy with an amazing personality  you know you can trust him because he's lived in vegas for a long time and knows everything about anything all the local spots what you need to know he gets straight to the point which i like highly recommend him great guy
1,friend with severe back pain introduced me to dr randall over a year ago he had worked on her through adjustments and therapy for years after having a major issue with my back and visiting other chiropractors with no relief i also went to dr randall i wasn't so keen on the neighborhood he's in but the prices are good and he is the best he's a small business owner that doesn't want to be big or have massive overhead to pass along to clients dr randall is an awesome chiropractor my entire family and all my neighbors go to him routinely for adjustments to prevent any major issues
1,noticed that the earlier reviews were from dr randall's former location the new location is really nice and the new massage therapist keri is one of the best i've encountered dr randall is the most knowledgeable personable and lol good looking chiropractor i've visited so i stuck with him i think it's so important to have a good relationship with a doc and one that really will talk to you about your spinal neck hip etc issues obviously this guy knows his stuff i can't believe the difference in my shoulder and neck since i've had regular visits  i don't have insurance but his visits are only $35 and that was as much as my co-pay used to be the new massage therapist is actually a neuro muscular medical massage therapist and you can't believe how the combination of massage and chiro adjustment has changed my overall health i'm 55 and don't have any pain thank you doctor randall and keri i'm finally a believer
1,randall is a very experienced chiropractor he is very good reading the spine and pointing where the problem is he has physical therapy area massage therapy room and massage therapist by appointment  dr randall adjustments helped me to get more balance in my body walking sitting even sleeping  i would definitely recommend dr randall
1,is the best masseur i have ever seen he's very knowledgeable in his massage techniques and in muscle release i had a lower back problem for several years and his sessions helped reduce my pain and eventually make it go away completely he excels at finding the tense places in the neck shoulders and hips and releasing them he's a great sports massage therapist and knows deep tissue trigger point and cranial sacral techniques the combined styles he uses works better than any one massage technique i've tried in the past  he's very flexible with scheduling and works late nights so when i can't make it in the evening i can usually get my massage at night though he does out calls i always went to him because he has a spa next to the massage room that i can relax in and warm up before he works on me which makes the massage much more effective and gives quicker results
1,have been going to jim for over a month now i have had several other massages here in vegas but jims is by far the best yet i always book 90 minutes in the mornings at his home and leave there floating away i have back and shoulder problems and jim knows exactly what to do and how much pressure to give me he even adjusts my back when necessary i get a weekly massage from jim and it is worth it i look forward to his warm hospitality and jokes every friday keep up the excellent work mike (qnicks)
1,first time i came to get a massage here i was in serious pain from a sports injury my right shoulder blade had shooting pain all the way down to my lower back and it lasted for days it was affecting everything i did on a regular basis i just couldn't move properly or even think clearly as the pain was so intense i was nearly in tears at one point and i even had to go to work with this pain it was not a happy timelol a friend referred me to 702massagecom and i went as soon as i could get an appointment i explained my problem to jim  and we got to work on the solution the session i had was the perfect combination of massage and adjustment of the muscles that were out of whack and partly responsible for the paini was in a bit more pain than i had ever been in and jim really fixed me up right i never had a chiropractic adjustment before and i never had a treatment that set me feeling as right as this one did i would highly recommend 702massagecom to anyone in a similar situation or anyone that just needs to loosen up
1,back was so tight and painful i could not sleep for over one hour at a time before waking up from the pain i went to a chiropractor years ago however though maybe a sports massage first would helpjim works with the unlv swim team the rugby championship tour recently held in las vegas the professional bull riders and many morehis many massage techniques were custom tailored to my problem it was incredible and after the first visit i felt my back relaxing from the stress i put on it he has made a huge difference on my back and saved me from expensive doctor visits there is a hot tub available to warm you up prior to your massage  note: it you're looking for a spiffy lobby silk robes juice bar etc this is not for you if you are wanting a legitimate great massage at a reasonable price - this is the best 
1,let me say that i am not someone who would normally go to a house for in-call massage nor am i into the idea of having a male massage me but i needed someone with the strength to correct my back issues    that being said jim's excellent reviews history as a sports masseur and very fair pricing overcame my initial objections and let me say i am glad they did jim provided me an excellent 1 hour deep tissue massage  he also helped adjust my lower back to assist with the sciatic nerve pain   he was also kind enough to provide me tips to help avoid future pain issues  jim is centrally located in las vegas (only 7 minutes east of the strip) professional courteous and talented  you can really tell he loves his work and loves helping people  i will be back for sure
1,have really really hard neckshoulders  they are rock solid and are usually located somewhere around my ears  i have a high stress job and i have gotten stress headachesmigraines  it is necessary for me to get regular massages to keep my headshoulders from taking over my entire skull  i used to go for spa massages when i was younger but now that i am older (read: middle aged) frou-frou massages just don't cut it  i need muscle elbow grease someone who is physical and has expert knowledge of the musculoskeletal systems of the human body  enter jim  my husband found him through yelp  i was a little nervous when we scheduled an in-room massage  he arrived on time  he was so pleasant  he worked on me first and then my daughter  i have never *ever* had a better massage  (and i am a massage whore -- i had them both before and after jim)  jim spoke to me to find out my specific needs and then he got down to business  i could tell by the way he poked and prodded me that he knew what he was doing  the way that he moved my limbs about so that he could access the muscles underneath -- that is artistry  he did some quasi-chiropractic moves -- adjustment releases etc  after me (round and fluffy) he worked on my skinny minny daughter  she was likewise satisfied (so he must have adjusted his touch so that he didn't break her bones)  the results from jim's massage lasted a good month -- far longer than ever before  i will see jim each and every time i go to vegas -- if i even get within 25 miles of vegas  thank you jim for raising the bar for my massages  you truly are the best and i will never forget you  (if i sound sappy let me tell you that this is the effect of jim's massages  he's that good)  ps  his prices are more than reasonable  don't waste your $ on a hotel massage  go to jim and use your $ on a facial or something
1,its been over a year and i still go to jims for a weekly massage he knows exactly what to do and what to fix when i am hurting i always get  the 90 minute massage and when its over i'm like already  loleveryone please let this man massage you you can't go wrong with that great discounted price  a++++++
1,you are looking for the best masseuse in vegas jim is the person i had the worst knots that had escalated so badly that it was giving me migraines and jim was able to get them out and give me relief  he is so knowledgeable about the body more like a physical therapistsports medicine masseuse  his prices are so reasonable and less than half of what you would pay for a mediocre massage at any hotel spa on top of all that he is the nicest person you'll ever meet  i've had bad massages from people who just don't enjoy what they do and you can really feel it  jim is so passionate about what he does and really cares about how you are feeling  he runs his business out of his home (actually in a cozy air-conditioned villa outside on his patio) and i think some people may be reluctant to try him out because of that but once you try him out you will not be able to go anywhere else  but for those that are still afraid to tryno problem  leaves more open slots open for all of us that know how good he is
1,my god i'm 5'9" 246 lbs im a rn so im always on my feet i lift weights and never stretch so needless to say i'm tight all over and have many knots having gotten 2 massages a month at countless different places asking for "deep" tissue jim was the only one to really get into my overworked never stretched muscles he cracked my back aligning it my headaches went away i don't get cramps in the middle of the night instead of getting a massage every other week this will now be my weekly routine and only with jim i highly recommend jim for ur massage needs
1,was in vegas on business and had read this guy's reviews  i could not believe someone would do this good of a massage for such little money but figured i might as well give it a try what else did i have to lose  i'm a bodybuilder and try and get a good deep tissue at least once or twice a month  in short his work is nothing short of incredible  it was the toughest deep tissue work i ever had and the effects were long lasting  he is able to reach muscle attachments that no other therapist ever has  if you are looking for a terrific deep tissue man he is your guy  the place is nothing fancy he works out of his house in a clean private room behind it  he deserves all those stars
1,performance center is a clean large physical therapy facility i went in for back issues that i have had for years and the physical therapist shelley was able to help me i have gone to chiropractors for years but have not seen anything but immediate relief however with no improvement shelley not only taught me more about my bodymuscles and how they work together but showed me proper technique when stretching and doing certain exercises i have also met with the other therapist derek steveson and he does exceptional work as well he is certified in more than just physical therapy and you know immediately that he has had many years in the field  everyone is very friendly and the front desk assistants were very helpful in helping me schedule my next appointment i will continue going here for physical therapy not only is it a good workout but i enjoy the atmosphere and the people who help me
1,in for a pulled leg muscle  the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable  they have a large therapy room with a lot of sports specific equipment  they were thorough in examining my leg and even noticed my ankle hadn't healed right from a break 15 years ago  i would highly recommend them to anyone in need of pt
1,performance center is an amazing place  there is a reason their clients range from professional athletes to senior citizens they know what they are doing  i was physically unable to walk after my injury and despite my doctors prognosis i am able to run today  physical therapy is not as easy as taking a pill  you get out of it what you put into it  that includes giving constant feedback to your therapist as you continue your therapy so they can monitor your progress  i was asked every session about my painsprogress and my tasks were always adjusted accordingly  without this team i would be considered handicapped today  i have recommended the fpc to my friends and they were also very satisfied with this business  i will continue to recommend them to anyone of any age looking for physical therapy  their staff is professional friendly and talented  best place in the valley for pt hands down
1,went to the clinic to prepare for a meniscus operationhad a great experience and my recuperation was very easy and shorter because of my preparation  i then did physical therapy with derek steveson and my knee has responded with skiing hiking and tennis  i have a tear in my other kneeand because of my program i have not had to have the surgeryi highly recommend the good doctor
1,luster is fantastic he has been great for the whole family my kids let him adjust them and even my wife she has always been a skeptic after recovering from surgery she was struggling with pain during her morning run dr luster was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem immediately he loosened up a muscle and adjusted her and she was immediately feeling better the following morning to her surprise she was able to run pain free in contrast to the previous weeks of consistent pain needless to say she needed no more convincing and trusted dr luster with all of her running needs especially race recovery and injury prevention
1,have been seen by dr dan for years he is excellent nd spends time with his patients to give them the best care possible he is worth the visit if you would like to be back to your "normal" self again
1,new office dr luster is amazing he made me feel better in just a few minutesi made the appointment because i've been suffering from migraines for decades and they were increasing in frequency and pain dr luster treated me which gave me instant relief from a migraine during my time with dr luster he developed a plan of treatment gave me numerous daily exercisesstretches and he provided me with nutritional options every time i see dr luster he proves that cares about getting me better and preventing my painful migraines thank you dr luster; i highly recommend you to all of my friends and family in need  i was also pleasantly surprised with other services available at clarity chiropractic such as; weight loss treatments wrinkle reduction and my personal favorite lipo-light (i can't wait to try that)
1,is the man
1,had a backache in my mid back that wasn't going away  i couldn't take full breaths  i had to hunch a little because sitting up or walking straight hurt  my initial thought was that since i practice yoga i can heal myself  i tried downward dog plow pose donurasana spinal twists  i tried hanging upside down and everything   we've all heard stories about chiropractic  it seems people either love them or hate them  this was my first visit to a chiropractor and i am a fan         although this guy danny is new to the phoenix valley he has been practicing in another state for a while  he seems like he is from the mid west  he is calm and and exudes a casual friendliness     the office was slow or he was ready for me  he led me to a table right away  he took a minute to feel around as we talked about my pain  he said it was obviously t7 based on what i was feeling in my back and it was quite common  he said could skip the x-ray if i wanted since i mentioned i was price sensitive    it didn't take long  he adjusted me and then gave a brief massage around the area stretching the muscles around it  he said it was important to adjust the muscles around the problem area because muscles are what holds the bones in place  the massage was great  danny seems to have a massage background  when i stood up the pain was already gone  as i write this review it has been 4 days and the pain has stayed away  i did 30 miles on my bike today  i am back to normal  what surprises me most is that this danny at clarity solved my problem in probably less than 15 minutes and i don't need to go back   i am used to doctors wanting to follow up perpetually for anther $50 visit etcthis guy seems to know he cured me and that was his intention  he seemed to know i'd be a one time visit he saved me the x-ray expense anyway  that makes it five stars in my book  ole
1,about the fact that office is absolutely beautiful forget that the staff is so accommodating just forget that you're in a clinic all together now i am not one to go to a chiropractor about 15 years ago i had a chiropractor hurt me pretty bad and since then if i even heard someone say they were going to a chiropractor i was the first to say "be careful"well dr luster saved my life yesterday seriously i was in so much pain i couldn't sleep i couldn't bend over i couldn't even drive properly i was a mess ribs out of place low back pain that wouldn't quit and neck pain that prevented me from being able to fully rotate (how was i driving in the first place)last night i finally got a decent nights sleep and today i feel like a million bucks do you hurt dr luster will make the hurt go awayi love this place and i got the best adjustment ever
1,love dr luster and his staff  they are friendly and professional  dr luster takes the time to address your back issues  he takes his time to give you excellent care  thank you
1,place is the greatest my back gives me static from time to time so i go in and dr luster is great about not just treating the problem but also letting you know what to do to avoid those painsmuscle pullswhatever in the future i'm not smart enough to follow his sensible advice so i need to keep going back someday maybe i'll learn
1,place is amazing from its atmosphere to its staff  dr luster truly cares about your health and he has the knowledge to help michelle is the best she is like spending time with a best friend and makes you feel welcome your first time there we love their flexibility and their willingness to make your life better  you have to give them a try  you will not be disappointed
1,have been getting adjusted  by dr luster for about four years now and can honestly say he is the only chiropractor i let adjust me now  the adjustments are smooth and the time and planning he puts into your care is unlike any other  most chiropractors i grew up going to would adjust you in a minute or two and be off to the next patient  dr luster actually takes the time to figure out what's causing the problem and oddly enough will even take time to chat with you and make sure you feel comfortable  he really is a great doctor i wish more chiropractors were more like him  stop wasting time searching around trust me you'll love him  the front desk staff is friendly and will always greet you by name which i thought was a great plus as well
1,love this banana there are always sales and promotions going on so there are always bargains to be had the store is always clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the producti love that there are three floors to explore two for women and one for men the merchandising manager dean has styled the store beautifully i love looking at the styling on the mannequins to get ideas for outfitsthe shoes have drastically improved over the years and i absolutely love the abby flats they are extremely comfortable while still being stylish they get new colors seasonally which makes me a happy girl
1,a former br employee i'm very hard on my shopping experiences at banana republic as a customer however i had a great time shopping here with my husband on saturday we shopped on all 3 floors and received multiple offers for assistance my husband was the focus of the trip and the guys on the men's floor were very helpful they asked what we were shopping for guided us in the right direction and set up a fitting room for him while we were still browsing next time i needwant to shop at banana this will definitely be the store that i head to
1,consider dicks to be by far the best sporting good store in charlotte or the surrounding areas it has pretty much everything from basketball equipment to under armor clothing they also carry things like exercise equipment guns heart monitors weight lifting gear etc etcthey even have a climbing wall (at least the one at south park mall does)
1,just ordered a knife from their online store  it turns out their picture was wrong and i got the wrong blade  i wrote them and tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid fedex label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no costi'm very satisfied with my experience with them
1,jessie brown's isn't in the most accessible or likely location it is easily one of my favorite places to buy gear and apparel i've been coming here for the past couple of years and have always found items that were difficult to come by deals that couldn't be resisted and always helpful staff though some of the gentlemen tend to have a bit of an attitude they are always willing to help you find what you're looking for the layout and decor is really welcoming and has a great feel these guys have a great selection from different brands north face arcteryx patagonia marmot and some others i also really dig that they have a good selection of climbing shoes and gear their shoe selection is always packed with all different levels of outdoor need i've never purchased one from these guys but they have a killer selection of knives too in the past couple of years i've purchased plenty of msr camp stove canisters from these guys they always have a plethora also picked up a nice thermarest from here most recently my wife and i were looking for a nice mid-layer jacket for the winter for her we checked out a few different options in the women's section and ended up scoring a great deal on a hooded zip from patagonia it was on crazy sale too don't remember exactly how much we ended up paying but i know it was close to 60% off from the previous year if i'm ever looking for something particular jessie brown's always has it or at least something comparable love coming to this local shop
1,shop people are really nice and they don't treat like a loser because you don't have a $1000 bike we've bought three bikes from them and traded in two old ones - getting a good price for each awesome small shop - really recommend it
1,have purchased several items from mike and gary over the years to include hockey gear oakley's baseball gear and now as of recent; bikes i used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date i once again went to the village peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at vp having two boys changing from bmx style to mountain bikes i had no idea what to look for size wise gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences when each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow in comparing two other bikes stores their sale prices were still more than village peddler everday prices can you say mark-upeach of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ridegary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own then asked them both to do it by themselves after about two times they are pros i was impressed as i sat back and watched the interaction between the boys gary and newly joining in on the conversation; mike it was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with gary and mike like they had known them for years it was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional both gary and mike spent about 25 minutes with them which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores i have been in customer service myself for over 20 years so it definitely takes a lot to impress me i have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line when i am considering spending a large amount of money if i am not impressed with your customer service you have definitely lost the sale in this case we as a family were treated excellent and coming from a guy in his 40's i don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great but in the case it most definitely was we added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere once we were done both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop while in the store i picked out a couple of bikes that i am intersted in and soon as have time you can bet that i am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense when i have a good experince shopping i tend to tell everyone i know and this time will be no different thanks for a pleasent experience guys i really appreciate it charles
1,you're a douche nozzle  when you talk about the "white" women in line waiting you clearly not only have a issue with white people but women as well  if you feel you were treated poorly it most likely didn't happen and if it did you deserved it  you expect too much in life and you give nothing in return  you suck for coming on this page and talking trash about the best local sporting store around  go shop at a big box store where they don't care about you and you can claim all white people are racists all day long  dick head
1,go wrong with their buy one get one free t-shirt section always a lot to choose from and a great atmosphere in the heart of campus
1,was definitely my favorite bookstore it always had all my books with used and new options reserving books online was definitely a time saver it has a year round t-shirt deal 3 for $20hello illinois t-shirt obsession i now have over 20 illinois t-shirts (i'm really serious) sweatshirts are a little pricey here but they tend to cost about the same at the other campus bookstores too  during the book purchasing rush the store has plenty of cashiers so the wait is never too long writing this review is making me miss tis and college
1,i know what you're thinking "what is a person from seattle doing reviewing a shop in urbana" well here we go my husband is from champaign-urbana and we are both fightin' illini fans (he by birth me by marriage) we can't buy illini gear in seattle so we had to go in search of somewhere we could te'shurt was the answer to our prayers they have a website we can order our things from and they are always delivered in a timely manner for reasonable shipping we have the battle in seattle coming up this weekend and we were in need of some fresh orange hoodies to rep our team in style so to the te'shurtcom site we went ordered our hoodies and asked to have them delivered fast so we could get them in time for the game got a call the next day from michelle and she was super friendly as she quoted the new price and told me i could think it over and email her back i did and we are eagerly awaiting our sweatshirts that will be here in seattle tomorrow just in time for the big game on saturday go fightin' illini and thank you te'shurt we will be ordering again soon as all our kids want sweatshirts too
1,they may be kind of small but they have made many great custom t-shirts for me even when i asked for them in a short amount of time i haven't found anyone on the internet yet that has made shirts at the same quality and speed as te shurt it might be a bit more expensive than some places but the quality of their lettering and presentation makes it worth the extra money
1,service i have received from te shurt has been great i have done a couple group orders here and the woman i worked with was more than accommodating i've requested orders on such a short time span and she worked with me to make sure everything i wanted was produced the quality of the custom printed shirts are superior to other printers on campus you won't feel like you have a shield of armor on your chest if you have a big design that uses a lot of ink some of the girls who work at the registers are idiots but what can you expect from a simple t-shirt shop if you are ordering shirts and you are polite reasonable and know what you want you shouldn't have a problem that's life for ya
1,bought the best pair of pants  new york and company but they were made for a mammoth supermodel (the were sold of the ones for "normal" women) anywho i took these pants in to brother's because my husband said they were good and they are amazing the pants were done in 15 minutes and when i looked at the hem it was the best i've ever seen this place is worth the money$
1,needed 2 pairs of pants altered in a hurry so i looked on yelp for a solid place by my house  i couldn't be happier with this place  the service price and quality i received were excellent  my pants were ready at the date and time promised and there were no issues  i am glad to have found a great tailor close by and will definitely be back
1,went in to brothers to buy a suit and i always have trouble buying a suit because i have huge shoulders and a tiny waist in comparison to my shoulders every suit i buy has to be completely recut and altered the problem is no one ever makes the final product look good i haven't had a tailor do all my alterations and have everything look exceptional at the end the owner worked with me personally and after trying 8-10 different design & models we finally found one that fit like a glove with minimal alterations required i was so thrilled with how everything fit that i decided to order custom shirts because i have a problem getting measured for those as well i have a big neck big shoulders and a small waist so finding shirts that fit well is nearly impossible after the shirts came in and tryed them on i have litteraly never had shirts that fit so perfect and the compliments i got made it worth while i highly recommend and you should see for yourself
1,went into brothers tailoring to buy suits i was absolutely blown away gus and his family were spectacular i wear suits to work every day and will not ever buy from anyone else they helped me pick out suits handled the tailoring and were so fun and entertaining as well do not think twice and do not go anywhere else
1,a last ditch attempt at exhibiting what may be the last shred of virility within my being i took one of my vintage robert graham shirts to brothersi did so after my wife plucked it from the goodwill pile reasoning how these folks can fix anything and how i shouldn't give away such an expensive party shirt i agreedand now i have a vintage robert graham shirt hanging in my closet just hanging therewaitingfor the day when my wife says something like;        "hey wanna go clubbing tonight"i have a feeling it may have to go back to brothers a few more times in its hanging careerwhile my weight changes like i'm a finalist in the duncan yo-yo tournament
1,had three suits made not too long ago that all fit well and were comfortable i went in today to get them touched up at brother's after trying them all on the guys there said they were well tailored suits and not to waste my money i was amazed that instead of trying to make a buck off of my misjudgment and therefore an unnecessary service they were completely honest i mean they technically lost business today because they didn't push for me to get them tailored instead they have gained my business for as long as i am in az because of their direct honesty and good principles i will and do recommend this place for anyone who wants an honest opinion on suits while i haven't had one madetailored there yet their business principles alone will bring me back
1,guarantee you will have a pleasurable experience at brother's tailors not only is the owner gus a pleasant guy to do business with; he will have you laughing at his general demeanor every visit on my second visit he recognized my face and instantly made me feel welcome not only is gus very hospitable the rest of the staff follows suit (horrible pun intended) you know the other tailors you go to that know you by ticket number stop going there brothers will make you feel like you're their only customer and will have you walking away feeling like a million bucks every time i'll admit i went into the store based on a friend's suggestion and when i first walked in judging by the size of the place i thought my friend had played a joke on me do not be fooled by its appearance brother's is the real deal in terms of selection they have everyone covered you can walk in and get a $150 suit off the rack which they'll tailor to your specifications at an insanely low price or you can walk in and completely customize a bespoke power suit if you don't really know what you want or you're buying your first suit for example gus or the other staff members will work with you for as long as it takes to get it right when i went in for a custom suit gus took no less than two hours catering to my every request is that something you'll get at men's warehouse the answer is no to be honest i will never step foot in another tailor's shop there's a reason why this establishment has a 5 star rating  i've been 4 times and gus and his staff have already made me feel like family this is the way small business is done       yes gus calls every guy that walks in the store a model yes when you come in for one suit he'll ask whether you want 6 or 7 however the bottom line is that brothers will give you the best customer service they'll make sure you get exactly what you want and they'll do it all for the best price in town
1,is absolutely the man the other guy working there who i believe is his son is also very good at what he does as is gus' wifei went in to get a custom suit and could tell that gus took a ton of pride in his work he had very strong opinions on what my suit should look like because he wanted to make sure that anyone who saw the suit would be impressed by it we ended up picking out a great material and a few weeks later the suit was readyi'd always heard the expression "fits like a glove" but i never really understood it until i tried that suit on i *thought* i had worn suits that fit me in the past but now i know i was sorely mistaken this guy is going to be making all of my suits as long as i'm in the valley
1,have been frequenting brother's tailoring since they first opened they were awesome then and they still are today over the years we have had hundreds of garments fixed shortened altered etc all done perfectly and promptly as of late i have bought a few suits and several pants for work gus margarita and their son have taken great care of myself and my family i love mom & pop shops and this place embodies what a full service tailer should be
1,highly recommend peter "the  1 son" he makes buying a suit or just boring alterations fun  this was my 1st time here    all of the customers love him and his family  thank you for all of your help i will definitely come back
1,measurements online from new jersey about a month ahead of our vegas wedding week or so later received an email saying my tux was ready and i should stop in to try it on when i arrive in vegas was not going to since i had arranged for delivery and pickup to and from my hotel but i am so glad i stopped in a few days beforehandthe shirt was a little big as well as the jacket (was our fault we did our own measurements) they fixed that right up in the shop and the tux that was delivered to the hotel was perfect a classy tuxedo at a decent pricejust super nice people i am so thankful they took care of me
1,haven't needed a tux in several years (since high school) but this was one special new year i popped into tuxedo junction and was quickly measured for my tux i got all black everything the staff is really friendly and professional (whatever that means) they even know quite a bit about house music edm is taking over vegasthey know how to properly measure you but most importantly they know their clothestwo days after my fitting i came in to pick up my tux word to the wisetry it on before leaving i apparently lost some weight in the two days i waited and had to get a slightly different size no big deal they took care of it on the spoti'd come back for another tux most likely next year for new year'sthank you tuxedo junction
1,have lived down the street from this place for eleven years but never went in until yesterday i needed a tuxedo for a weird sort of lesbo-chic photo shoot where i would be wearing a purple 80s bridesmaid dress and another female model would be wearing a tux the other model was too busy to go to the tux place so the photographer asked me to do ita super-friendly helpful kid named zach helped me try on all kindsa creepy mini-tuxedos that must have been designed for teenage boys or something because they fit me perfectly then he helped me find the right shade of purple for the bowtiecummerbundand this was going off a shitty cell phone pic i had of the dressthe photo shoot isn't until the end of the month but i'll be sure to post a pic here so you can see zach's fabuous work the rental is going to be $100 for the daynot bad at allthis shop was clean well-lit and very well staffed check it out
1,place  i walked out of men's wearhouse very angry after being told my son's vest rental would cost $75  yes one vest for one night  i called to check prices and felt like i had returned from the twilight zone  i drove directly over got my son fitted for a vest and even rented shoes for a total of $25  after realizing i may have been a little angry still when i arrived i told the clerk where i came from and it was obvious he immediately understood my frustration  love giving business to local businesses to help out my town and without a doubt have my business for life
1,was so good i had to write my first yelp review danny lyon took care of me do not hesitate to go here for a tux rental
1,a larger woman and had a hard time finding a woman's tux for a work event looked at yelp and found this place;) the employees at tuxedo junction were so kind and helpful and made me feel comfortable;) it was a great experience  thank you all so very much;)
1,in to rent a tux for prom and although it looks a little run down the service is actually really really great the whole staff was friendly i was helped by a pretty woman called nicole and she was on top of everything and the total was under $80 which blew me away great great place
1,growing up my family owned a formal and men's wear store so i understand a little about the business and some of the challenges  working with them upon different occasions i am always impressed by their professionalism and dedication to making things right  when i referred a friend for his wedding i had pre-selected a style which i thought would be perfect  upon arrival and pulling the full tuxes for them to try on we realized it wasn't the right look for the guys  nicole was outstanding in helping us switch out to try a couple other looks and making sure everyone was comfortable  having worked with nicole before i can attest her patience and demeanor is perfectwhat i like most is that they have just about everything in stock  they can make alterations there as well so if the groomsmen arrive with the wrong measurements (which is not so out of the ordinary) they can measure to make sure they have the right fit  michelle is my main contact and is always ready to provide guidance and support  i have yet to find anyone in the group that is not exceptionalthey are definitely customer service oriented and are always there to help walk you through the process
1,place is so great the service is amazing and everyone is so friendly i can't believe how many more options there are many more options here than mens wear house i was so disappointed at their service and options we can't wait to use tuxedo junction for our wedding day
1,a guy waited until the last possible minute (no literally) to get a tux for my wedding (my wife was horrified)  linda (hope i got the name right - short firecracker) had me in and out in under 30 minutes with the exact tux i was looking for  need a tux  go here
1,little boutique may be small but it packs a big punch in the world of shoes and i could spend all day drooling over the babies in here it did make me sad to see my very own peep-toe louboutins displayed in the window here all shiny and new when mine are a bit more well loved and not in the same condition as the beautiful new ones in the window oh well i guess shoes are for wearing and i've certainly got the wear out of minein addition to louboutins pam jenkins also offers jimmy choo's tory burch and kate spade so if you're a shoe fan head along here to check out the glamorous heelsthey also do sales so you could grab yourself a bargain pair of beautiful shoes hurrah
1,oh man you've got game if you shop here if i were a guy i would buy my entire wardrobe from stitched a combination of classic and contemporary suiting and street - this is how a man with swag dressesthe store itself is the ultimate man cave there's a billiard table in the back flat screen tvs on espn and even a whisky lounge with macallan scotch lockers to rent there are also several cool choppers worked into the decor there's an on-site tailor stitching up sharp suits too personalized with your name if you'd like probably the only thing missing is a cigar bar and hot female cocktail serversprice points are really reasonable a lot of the coats and blazers that i liked were around $250 you'll find ready to wear brands like george esquivel jacks & jokers rag & bone cr8tive recreation louis stewart and psycho bunnyand girls the sharp looking men that work here make the visit worthwhile too
1,place with up and down clothing wear hidden back room with a place to chill and drink cocktails with the boys it over looks the strip and they have some sick bikes on display
1,cool place i stumbled on while waiting for my reservation at e  i was surprised at how comfortable i was here  guess i am more hip and trendy than i thought  the staff was very friendly and they are wheelchair accessible
1,owner spoke with me for over an hour on the history of the store we discussed why he chose each product sold in his store as everything was hand picked the ambiance of the store is done perfectly and would be respected by anyone interested in interior design it is obvious the people who work at stitched are deeply knowledgeable and passionate regarding fashion and truly love what they do *i mentioned that i was going to be eating at stk that night and he suggested he walk us up (my group of 7 had no reservations on a busy night) i had a great experience here and look forward to visiting again
1, cool clothes for mid level ballers  never thought i'd spend $330 on a shirt and a tie but there i was 30 minutes later saying goodbye to misha with an adorable bag in my hand that said stitched on the side  :) thanks mishabrady
1,customer service from branden enjoyed a fun time here and kept my cool as i know i could just go crazy buying some really nice mens wear to update my professional attire plus:learned to tie a bow tie and a few cool new tie techniques enjoyed a shot of espresso and offered some scotch while i shoppedbought a nice shirt and tieminus:actually can't think of any other than knowing that i could easily bruise my credit card here if not carefuli will be back for sure and home to get a suit next time
1,is a cute place and the staff is super friendly they have a range of brands from stirched to jacks and jokers
1,love love love stitchedthis little men's clothing boutique in the cosmo hotel is very unassuming especially when compared to the nightclub-like allsaints next door  it's also very elegant with decor reminiscent of an upscale bachelor pad complete with leather couches and liquor cabinetthe clothing selection is excellent  their in-house brand offers up wonderfully tailored shirts and suits  i adore the accessories especially the collection of colorful silk ties that seems to go on forever  and the hats  to die fori wasn't planning on buying clothing in vegas but i fell in love with the selection of hudson jeans and couldn't say no to them  and the prices at stiched are actually reasonable compared to some of the other overheated strip shops  the real highlight is the staff  ryan b was infinitely helpful and patient with me while i tried on various items and acted like my typical obnoxiously indecisive selfi'd be back to give stitched my business anytime  :-)
1,stitched everyone is so friendly and fun ask for ryan for a great shopping experience
1,custom tailor & retail shop is classy and quality fine selection of men's clothes shoes accessories knowledgeable high-end tailors would love to see how they can dress my man
1,simply you will look and feel like a million bucks in anything doug recommends i went in to have some tailoring done on a suit i already owned and i couldn't believe how good the suit looked when they were finished i have developed a new appreciation for what can only be described as an art form (please excuse the pun) as doug explained their process with a true passion the service is absolutely top notch and i certainly look forward to my next visit thanks so much doug
1,customer service go see doug for all your clothing needs i would not go anywhere else would give 6 stars if i could
1,lewin besoke clothiers a name synonymous with luxury in beverly hills is now in scottsdale  doug carlton the owner of this new custom clotherie in scottsdale old town is a consummate professional in every sense of the word  doug goes the extra mile to make each of his clients feel that are the most important client to him  the atmosphere he has created at his boutique harkins back to the old school days of a classic haberdashery  the atmosphere is completely comfortable and doug makes sure to make you feelbyou are in good hands  if you have never experienced custom clothing  you are missing out on pure luxury  art lewin bespoke clotherie and doug carlton should be your only go to team
1,have never considered a suit shop to have my women's dress shirts tailored but since i have gone in and worked with "doug" i can't imagine going anywhere else unlike other tailor experiences "doug" actually listened to how i wanted my new shirts to fit he made my once squarish and unflattering business shirts into form fitting shirts that complement my body i couldn't be happier with my experience and i recommend all men and women to go to "doug" with any suit or tailoring needs
1,for the vikings  sure they might have looted and pillaged their way across europe and spawned plenty of bad death metal bands but in the grand scheme of things that's pretty minor why because without a little genetic mutation spawned in scandinavia that allows adults to continue consuming dairy all their lives i'd have to avoid the amazing cheese section that penn mac has and would be stuck eating some funky soy based cheese or *gasp* having to do without and that would be a sad day indeedwith enough cheeses to make wallace & gromit happy you are bound to find what you are looking at penn mac   and if you don't know what you are looking for the cheesemongers are great in helping you find your wheyif that was all penn mac had it would still be a required shopping destination but they have so much more  their deli is just as amazing with the best prosciutto di parma you can buy  and if you can't find the olive oil or other italian ingredients you need here then the only place you are going to find them is back in italy
1,need you in los angeles boo hoo wah sob appreciate this place pittsburghers it rocksthe cheese is of amazing quality and freshness what fucking varietyand there are a million other tasty things under this roof you can't find a place like this easily trust me i have tried
1,the hook amazing selection of cheesego here
1,agree this is a wonderful place to buy cheese  anywhere else in pittsburgh (and i do mean tj's and whole foods as well as giant eagle) your cheese is likely to taste like the plastic it is wrapped in  at penn mac it's not only the best in town it's beyond excellent  in price freshness quality selection  you can buy half pounds despite what the sign says  i always did  i also think the nuts are a great deal  and the spices  worth the trek from whatever neighborhood you live in or from your downtown workplace  if you have a car they do have (limited) parking in back  and some of the nicest flowers in pittsburgh are sold out front too  holiday seasons and weekends this place is a bit nuts but i went regularly year-round maybe every 2 weeks and totally relied on this placefoodies visiting pittsburgh especially if you're staying in the convention center area should definitely check out "the strip" for shopping and snacks
1,mac deserves more than 5 starsthis place is the best italian food store i've seen anywhere in the us  the selection and quality of their cheeses meats olives pastas oils sauces etc is just incredible  the prices are also really good - any other store with a big cheese selection will charge a ton morei used to shop here at least once a week and since i've moved away from pittsburgh this is the store i miss the most  i now live in chicago and even here there is nothing like it  i still frequently buy their stuff online through their websitethank god for the internetfavorite items include: calabrese olives house italian olive oil istara cheese mortadella wpistaccio ciabatta bread
1,much to oggle so much to buy i think i'm in love i had too much fun at this place great selections of cheese meat pasta etc makes me want to buy and play they also had the biggest bottles of olive oil i'd ever seen so you know you can buy just that exact quantity of oil that you need i must go back
1,and dudettes this place is amazing they've got cheese pepperoni and prosciutto coming out their ears fresh pasta homemade pasta sauce and olive oil from the barrel for the taking they've got frozen dough pepperoni slices and shredded cheese all next together if you want to bake your own pizzas when they're not busy go to the deli and find the perfect compliment to whatever wine you've been needing an excuse to drink the people that work there are the nicest folk that clearly love their jobs most of them love that i don't know the first thing about anything italian because it gives them a chance to share what it is they specialize in goods are cheap fresh and of the highest quality i hope i'm able to find something similar when i move soon one of the top 10 reasons i've enjoyed my time in pittsburgh
1,darling you talkin' to your boyfriend"  the deli counter man recently teased me as i waited in line talking on my cell phone  oh the deli men - they're hilarious  i'd even say their worth the trip out to the store but you might want to know more about the food glorious food i shop at the macaroni company weekly  they're great  from the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait to the great selection of bulk foods to fine selection of meats to the italian cheeses to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and jupiter this place is lovely  (or loverly if your eliza dolittle)  the place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends and i think many people are tourists but that doesn't stop it from being great and that was a long sentence but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors i've readin any case the macaroni company is a little slice of italy mixed with pittsburgherness and fun
1,will never buy any type of italian sausage at giant eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like  and the deli counter guy at giant eagle doesn't inappropriately and amusingly call me "babe" every five seconds like the ones at penn mac do   ordering "hot italian sausage" from a deli guy that calls you "babe" is as amusing as sunday morning can get   :-)    i'll keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as i live in pittsburgh
1,walked into penn macaroni co knowing i knew absolutely nothing about cured meats and cheeses  i've always been intimidated by specialty shops bc there are always giant lines with people who look impatient and want to just grab what they need and head out  i decided to swallow up my fear and head inside with the intention of walking out knowing more than when i walked ini headed to the cured meats section in the deli room and kinda just stood back staring at all the beautiful meats  when one of the deli guys was free and asked me if i needed help i flat out told him "i know nothing about anything in this room  but i want to learn"  and he was like "i got just what you need" and brought out some samples for me  he went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff  after i picked out my meat i was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like "i'm not done with you yet" and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out  he also told me i have to feed my friend more bc she looked too skinny pi love going into a store where i get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job  it just makes you walk out with a smile on your facei plan on heading back every other week to get a new pairing of meats and cheeses and hopefully one day my palate will be super sophisticated haha
1,boyfriend and i made a trip to wisconsin dells for my birthday and stopped here on the way back to chicago to get some cheese all of the employees here were extremely helpful and friendly cheese was decent priced and delicious i'd recommend it
1,little shop off of the interstate i was looking for a place to go that wasn't fast food and wasn't the same old-same old i was surprised how much i liked this place made to order deli-sandwiches cheese fudge a new glarus beverage and southern comfort yes southern comfort true one stop shopping i will make this a regular stop between elgin and minnesota
1,the many varieties of cheese and take some butter swiss home you will love the flavor :)
1,always seem to miss these cheese shops passing through the dells we stopped here coming back from des plaines in oct and it's right off the exit as you enter there is a display of fudge but they only want to cut it for you on the way out next are all the gadgets and gifts i got some cool reading glasses a ghost cheese spreader body shampoo a wi shot glass cheese slicer we were hosting the upcoming fountain pen meeting and bought a great variety of meats and cheeses one large beef summer sausage i brought to my thanksgiving hostess picked up a cranberry jelly various crackers i got to sample all the cheese spreads and settled on the sharp cheddar i loved the beef and cheese snack pack because they came in small bites we left with a few sundries and of course the fudge be prepared to drop at least $100 and this was us restraining ourselves
1,samples of cheese cheese spreads and fudge as good as it gets i love this place we bought about $15 worth of cheese after being pampered and trying about 10 different types of cheese 5 types of cheese spreads and 2 types of fudge the store has tons of wisconsin favorites which i suppose is in part of attracting tourists to think that they are purchasing purely "wisconsin" delicacies
1,cheese and more cheese oh and wine fudge and kitschy souvenirs too the anticipation of stopping here on the way back to chicago from hanock wi made the three hour ride home more bearable the staff was super friendly and willing to let you sample almost anything i tried some cheese spreads fudge and fancy cheeses such as mango habanero i regret not picking up more cheese
1,happy we stopped here wisconsin cheese wine & beerperfect for dinner we tried about 10 cheeses and fudge they were all so goodthe dark chocolate caramel salted fudge was delicious glad we stopped here and so will you :)
1,off the freeway next to a gas station we couldn't visit wisconsin without a trip we had low expectations since it looked cheesy (yes i said it) from the outside and we expected this place to be a regular liquor store but it is truly a wonderful world of cheese fudge  great wine end beer selections they have a table where you can sample any of their many cheese spreads here are some of the flavors: taco smoked port wine bacon pumpkin cranberry garlic etc so many choices so little money unfortunately then there was the selection of blocks of every kind of cheese the staff was very knowledgable and helpful you can sample pretty much everything besides the alcohol of course i love this place and would come back someday if i want to make the 9 hr drive again but i got a brochure so i can order online too
1,like that this place has a big selection of craft beers they have a mix and match section which is $999 for a 6 pack that is pretty standard pricing the guy was very knowledgeable and gave me recommendations as to what i would like they have a huge cheeses wine fudge and specialty food items you could sample whichever cheese you wanted many of them unique we know wisconsin is full of cheese and boy did this place deliver at check-out they had fudge pops which were also pretty tempting
1,love cheese this place is like i imagine many others throughout wisconsin but since i went to this one and liked it 5 starswe stopped here on a road trip and was happy to see it open before 10 walking in we saw more than just a cheese house they had specialty gifts wine beer and fudge amongst a haven of cheese the people who worked here were incredibly helpful and friendly they were happy to give advice about what beer we would like and happily cut samples of cheese although we only left with a 6 pack of wisconsin only beer for $999 i was tempted to buy much much more it is possible we will stop on our way back
1,first time i stepped into the store i was hit by a wave of wonderful aromas that reminded me of growing up in germany the lunch meats smoked hams brats blutwurst etc are from authentic german recipes and one can even get a real schnitzel here the ladies behind the counter treat you like you would get treated in a store in germany and the store also offers a selection of foods imported from germany jams coffee breads dairy products like butter and quark cookies candy canned goods cooking and baking mixes if you have german recipes and haven't made them because you can't find the right ingredients or if you just like good food please pay this store a visit you will be pleasantly surprised but bring cash no credit cards accepted or you could go next door to the black forest mill to have your german meal prepared for you along with a german beer
1,place is a wonder  all kinds of sausages and meats  i'm a real push over for smoked meat  i especially like their lachs schinken which is smoked ham cut very thin  making soup  try it with a smoked pork haxen  another favorite is their fleisch salat  but beware the fleisch salat is put into a container without weighing so the price of each container may not be what you think it will beclose but not exactgreat place and like all german butcher shops it's closed on monday
1,can smell those brats simmering in beer & onionsahhhhhhhsimply the best
1,german sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in phoenix  our family has been enjoying their homemade ham lyoner bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years  their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh  walking through the door will immediately transport you to europe  don't miss this valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days
1,glad we found this place everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in germany walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too  this is our number one place for authentic german meat
1,german sausages that i ever had  they taste the same as those that i had when i traveled to germany  and the best thing is that they will vacuum packed them so they can last for a month and taste just as fresh as long as you don't break the package
1,was raised in germany this place is as close to "home" as it gets try everything the service is gracious bring cash if the made cake that day don't ask what it is just buy it it's going to be delicious leberwurst (liver wurst) is fantastic best i have had in the us every sausage tastes authentic and fresh you won't regret it
1,place is awesome we can't eat regular store bought brats anymore their potato salad is to die for as wellwhen you walk in you get a strong smell ofwell something awesome and smokey and realize behind the register there are smoked something or others hanging right there in front of you to the left are some grocery items as well as spietzle (sp) and some other items to the right is the deli counter that holds tons of meats and other goodies as well as their brats they have two kinds from what i have seen course ground and find ground i believe i am not sure of the difference since we usually only get the fine ground white onesthey make limited portions of everything since its all fresh so get there fast for the potato saladthis is our go to for grilling out and its always delicious
1,is a true phoenix treasure the two sisters are very helpful pleasant and business-like sometimes when they have meat just out of the smoker they will offer a sample or they'll toss in an end chub (wrapped) into your bagit seems like they know you're going to rip into one of the other packages if they don't come with cash & chose practically anythingsandwich meat sausages or the uber yummy beer-case cheese  every time in there are usually some europeans shopping there which also validates the legitimacy of this fine establishment
1,i love more than german sausage and when it's authentic i can't stop smiling - just standing in the store hearing orders in deutsch sends me over the moon today i just grabbed 2 wieners and 2 bratwurst as i patiently await my sauerkraut i've got brewing in my crock at home homemade cheese and cabbage soup with authentic fried wiener on top and i've got myself heaven have always wanted to stop in here and now i have a reason to make it a constant in my life
1,place is truly a gem of the east valley first of all it's cheaper than cheap secondly and most importantly they have the most amazing selection of locally grown produce oh my god it makes me so happy i'm probably going to cry i asked the owners how they keep their prices so reasonable and they said it's because they work with farmers that don't sell at the local farmer's markets but want to sell their produce nonetheless what they can't get locally (due to season or unavailability) they have from other states they also carry home-made tortillas kettle corn honey and salsas- all local i absolutely love this place if you can't get to the farmer's markets or live too far (like me) you have to check this place out
1,the summer months this stand-alone farmer's market doesn't carry as much locally grown produce especially at the end of the summer like july-sept nearly everything they carry is from elsewhere due to the high heat of az i'm sure that's fine with me but unfortunately that means veggies and fruit from other parts of the country that aren't as fresh i've gotten some bad produce but the good part is i can just take it back and get a refund i do think though that next summer during this time i'll be going to one of the various weekly farmer's markets or just to sprouts for produce every other time i'll still be here :)
1,of the great things about living near farmland is farmer's markets of course it's a little tricky to do here in the heat of the summer but the power road market manages to stay stocked year around with produce that is fresh and for the most part local it's a small mom-n-pop market but they work with local retailers around the valley to bring in all sorts of different foods that go way beyond produce they also roast fresh chilies daily & sell locally made tamales and salsa too the prices are what really get me so many complain about the jacked-up prices of farmer's markets but this place has always been either the same in price or i pay even less plus because most of it is local the food lasts longer if you're in the east valley they are worth checking out and changing where you buy your produce buy local whenever you can
1,little farmers market is pretty solid fresh local produce that beats the hell out of anything you can get at the grocery store the tomatoes they sell actually taste like tomatoes their fruit is much better as well and the the kickerwait for itfreshly roasted hatch green chilies they also have a peach orchard out back you can pick your own or buy them in the shop when they're in season just a great all around local farmer's market you need to check it out
1,produce and cheap prices-not to mention friendly staff-could not ask for more
1,love this market  the prices are a bit steep and if your order is less than 10 bucks they charge you to use a credit card but other than that a great place to do business with  the do carry fresh okra but you will want to call to be sure they have it in stock because it sells fast (480-497-0706) - julie will usually hold some for you if you are on your way and will be there in just a short while  tj - nah he has to be prodded  they also carry green tomatoes - but call first  lastly they carry fresh hatch green chili (in season - aug - oct) in big jim barkers and sandia  this is a family business i was happy to find and will continue to support for a long time
1,have lived not 5 miles from the fabulous market and just never noticed it or went in till yesterday what a find fresh farm eggs local artisanal cheeses i bought a black truffle parmesan chunk and it is so rich and delicious i also bought some " holy hummus " omg it is so luscious and fresh this is family run and the woman who checked me out could not have been nicer the produce was spectacular this is a gem in my own neighborhood that i just discovered
1,is a top notch market  they offer a wide variety of fresh fruit and vegetables all year long bread from local bakers a full meat counter and a large outdoor gardening area in the summer  there's an extensive wine and liquor store in back with a knowledgeable staff to help you navigate  to top it all off they carry an insane variety of cheese much of which you can sample - get your squeaky fresh cheese curds here if you missed them at the farmer's market
1,made my first trip to brennan's today and it was well worth the trip across town the fruit and veggies were absolutely beautiful and delicious they have signs indicating where the produce came from and little pre-cut samples so you can taste how good everything is the michigan blueberries they have in right now are heavenly the fresh bakery area smelled wonderful the meat counter is run by jacobson's brother and had a deli case of typical salads and deli meats as well as fresh steaks pork and chicken i grilled up a small sirloin that tasted like summer there is also a fresh fish counter a lot of wine and a ton of cheese many of which you can sample
1,love brennan's  they have a great beer and cheese selection the fruit is always fresh and usually the best in the area  my one compliant is that they are more expensive than other places but it is worth the extra cost for great products and service
1,finally set foot in a brennan's market and i am so glad i did  for produce the place is unbeatable  the fruit looked perfectly ripe and yummy and they had all these samples  plus they had a ton of different cheesesyou know what i honestly think is the best thing ever  the brennan's granola  but at $10 a bag it's a little pricey  kind of worth it sometimes though
1,stopped by brennan's every day on my recent trip to madisonthe produce is so good especially the idaho peaches the local cherry wine cheese curds and organic honey pretzel sticks were also awesome i could gain 50 pounds on the free samples alonei miss you brennan's
1,samples garnish the aisles local flavor is found at every turn then there's the annual selection of selection of world championship cheeses brennan's is the single most place that i recommend all who visit madison to visit plenty of people drive along the many cheese barns of the interstate only to find a selection of novelty items and subpar cheeses so if you're not from the area and you find yourself in town this is your chance to learn what cheese in wisconsin is all about the smoked mozzarella sticks find me every time
1, brennan's has the best selection of wisconsin cheeses - many are award winning - and they taste wonderful  plenty of samples  their fruit selection is unmatched in dane county  again more samples  it's nice to buy great tasting fruit that isn't spoiled one day later  we always take out-of-town friends and family to brennan's at least once during their visits
1,love brennan's you can always find great local food and produce here they put out lots of fun samples and the staff is always smiling and helpful
1,only go to this place for my steaks this is the closest place you'll find to prime their grade is high quality choice grade not like the ones you see at the grocery store but better
1,go here to buy cheese fresh fruit and frozen fruit the cheese selection is excellent much of it is packaged under their own label they obtain many of the national cheese contest winners most of it is affordable high quality cheese they often have samples they'll help you out if you are buying for a party or a gift they sell holiday gift boxes and make spreads etc for parties the fresh fruit selection is excellent they often have samples-very important to me with peaches and plums-i find the best ones they have and then buy a box  they have bags of frozen fruits (and vegetables) a good place to get fruit for pie or smoothies when fresh is not available they seem to have a lot of beer and wine a meat shop vegetables and bread as well but look to the other reviews for info on that they also have some packaged goods that seem a little on the expensive side i just stick with the cheese and fruit
1,you want a good tasty budget brat" says my bossman "go for the johnsonville smoked cheddar jalepeno"  *cringe*two things here:  (1) what the heck is a "budget brat" and (2) barf  if you're going to eat meat in tube form  do yourself a favor:  spend the extra 20 cents per pound (yes i actually checked some brat prices) go down to bavaria sausage kitchen and get the real thing  they've got your regular brats your fresh brats your smoked brats your beer brats your weiners your weisswurst your polish and a bunch of sausages you've probably never heard of but are undoubtedly delicious  i did a bbq for about 70 people which gave me the opportunity to load up on just about every tubed meat in the case  plus bsk has their more popular products packed in cases of 25 in the freezer ready to go  service was nice and prompt even with such a big order right near the end of business  and most importantly my customers were happy  i received lots of compliments on the quality and there wasn't a single sausage left at the end of the day (although i did spy a few half-eaten greasy frozen burgers that had been abandoned)  so for the quality the location and the servicebavaria sausage kitchen has earned their five stars  a few minor details  thanks to daniel k for the recommendation  the bsk website looks a little garish but his comment got me over that  also let me say bsk has tons of other products  we talking cold cuts salami bacon cured pork concoctions cheeses dry goods and what appears to be the largest collection of imported haribo (german original brand of gummi candy) anywhere outside of germany  i won't lie i took a couple packs to snack on
1,this place is the bee's knees the brat's tots erit's zehr gut mr g fired up a tasty smoked brat that we later added to red beans and rice dang that is no budget brat the ladies behind the counter were very helpful and because we bought a huge amount for a party they even threw in a free box of orange liqueur chocolates for usi inquired about a curious sign near the cash register that read "fresh venison" basically if you're a local hunter and bring your deer in here they'll do all the necessary butchering for you sometimes they have leftovers for customers to purchase sounds a little wild but next time i might be gameoh and ditto on the haribo gummy candy selection it's huge
1,never had a bad experience at this place  the german food selection is great and the frozen and refrigerated selection is always tasty (i recommend the sauerbraten) fridays when the weather is nice they grill out on the front lawn  stop by for a great selection of sausages cooked up freshas a counter point to a one star review for this place  it was written while bavaria sausage was closed for fire repairs so who knows how accurate that review might be
1,has no one reviewed this place yetit's amazing we need more places like this in americamy boyfriends parents wanted a gift card from here for christmas so we made a stop while we were in town yesterdayas mentioned previously it's amazingi'm a vegetarian so the meat has no appeal to me but they had a ton of sausages sliced meats and even fish their selection of cheese was also quite impressive what really was cool to me was the massive amounts of chocolate and european bakery mixes i had a hard time picking out what i wanted until i saw a box full of chocolate with a picture of kittens on it and it was called katzenzungen its so fun just to say although i looked it up on the internet and the chocolates are supposed to look like cat tongueswhich is kinda weird but still super awesome at the same timei will for sure stop in and visit bavaria the next time i am in madison
1,great german deli and sausage housethis little store has everything you would ever need that is german and sausages galore  they make their own german style sausages in house and they are some of the best sausages you will ever have  the store is wooden and looks quaint and the selection is varied  inside they have a german style deli with cold cuts and fresh sausage and in the corner they have a freezer where you can buy boxes and boxes of sausages  from brats to white sausage to weiners there is nothing they don't have  german candy is found in the corner and dried meats on the other side of the store pickles are on the wall and ginger bread treats in the aisle  service is good and the staff is so friendly
1,like this store for its products and its knowledgeable staff  i guess if i need smiles i'll go to a strip club as long as you keep giving them money they'll keep smiling
1,lived in madison for a couple years now that i have moved away there are a couple things that i sincerely miss sausages from bavaria sausage inc are some of those things this place is amazing it is outside the main part of the city but it isn't too far away do yourself a favor and purchase some delicious tubular meats from these guys the cheese is pretty tasty as well
1,are your go to-  goat cheese people  not only do they make good cheese but they are an awesome long time local dairy family that i have adored for over 10 years love to buy local you should  than hit up one of their stands at one of the local farmers markets try the bucky breeze  it's like a sour cream creme fraiche   i love  the feta it's super yummy with eggs 
1,everyone just 4 stars crow's dairy get's 5 they have the best chevre i've ever tasted consistently excellent smooth texture the flavor has the nice tanginess of goat cheese but it's very smooth and clean some goat cheeses can get a little too overwhelming i've been buying them at a various local farmer's markets for a while since i'm slow on the uptake i didn't realize it was available on the shelves of the phoenix public market every day of the week now that i know that i'll be eating it much more frequently yum
1,you like chevre you have to try the chevre from crow's dairy i'm ridiculously hooked on it so is my almost 8-year-old daughter to the point where i sometimes hide the chevre in the fridge for fear she'll eat too much of it before i get to it i've had both the plain and peppercorn which are fantastic on wheat crackers i've also tried the quark which i like to smooth over a toasted bagel and the feta which is great  but the chevre is my first and best love from crow's dairy and whenever i need chevre i try to make a trip to the farmer's market rather than buy it from a store as the store-bought stuff is never as fresh and tasty
1,a long time lover of great cheeses and especially feta there is no place better to get your cheese from than crow's dairyi have tried almost all of the different kinds they make and i think the worst part is picking which one to buy  the regular feta and the peppercorn feta are two of my must-haves  the peppercorn gives a nice little kick thats great paired with tomatoes and cucumbers  also the chevres are creamy and so delicious  if you are looking for more of a sweet treat from your cheese definitely try the butter pecan  it tastes like a delicious cheesecake and i could literally eat an entire container by itself in one sitting (thank god for self-control right)i would say that worst thing about crow's dairy cheese is that i have to wait until the weekend farmer's market to get it
1,you like feta or cheve goat cheese crow's dairy makes the beat cheese ever they also started making gelato that is to die for while their cheese is used in a lot of restaurants you can also find them at a ton of farmer's markets if you see them around definitely try it
1,down the best milk i have ever tasted if you live in estrella mountain ranch verrado litchfield park buckeye goodyear or avondale - this family owned and run farm is just a few minutes away in rainbow valley we just returned home with 2 gallons of vat-pasteurized goat milk that i'm sure won't last the week if the only goat milk you've had is from the grocery store you've never had good goat milk call wendell (623-wendell) during the week and you can make an appointment on saturday morning to visit the dairy and purchase milk goat cheese or anything else they have made fresh that week we've also had their ricotta and ice cream which was absolutely delicious on our first visit wendell gave us a mini-tour to show us how they care for the goats and their milk it's a permanent part of our saturday morning routine now they do recommend you bring an ice chest - we haven't yet but we live really close in emr stop by and visit - you'll wonder what you waited for
1,only wish i could find more of their products yummy a word to all: support your small local businesses you will get fresher healthier food and keep more of each dollar you spend in your community good job crow's dairy i love your goat products let me know if you make ice cream i'll be the first to go out and buy it
1,somewhat gourmet sandwiches  hot  cold  you name it  great little sides as well  subway this place is not  also doubles as a respectable little deli  if you didn't think you spending enough money on cheese stop in here and buy some $14 havarti
1,mah-vo-lis divine sandwiches and deli salads they can be a little slow with the hot sandwiches but are well worth the wait besides you get to play trivial pursuit while you wait and i always buy my cheese thereand then buy some wine down the street at barriques
1,be the only place in the valley that carries jamon serranonot to mention the deliciously perfect artisinal chorizoi love this place  just keep me away from all of the awesome cheese
1,boyfriend his sister and i were planning to eat at settebello this past sunday we got there a lil bit too early (just before they opened at noon) so we stopped into valley cheese & wine just across the parking lot my boyfriend was really impressed by their collection of mollydooker wines we'll definitely be back for some tastings & to pick up some bottles
1,and kristin really know their stuff  just about every time we've been into the shop we've asked for a recommendation for something new and they've never lead us astray  excellent selection of wines cheeses and other delectable snacks
1,stars to the owners who really know their stuffs they're really friendlyfive stars to their selection of winesand last but not least to their cheese and dry goodstheir chorizo is soooo good have u tried their boucheron cheese the best i've tried in a long time paired it with their really expensive crackers i dont remember the name but they're artisan from californiaoohhh and buy their truffled honey and pour it on top of brie cheeseohh that's heaven
1,place rocks  i am glad that i work nearby because otherwise i might not have found it the parking lot is a bit large and desolate which only adds to the feeling like you have found somewhere special and perhaps unknown by many  i met bob the owner and he was so helpful and friendly  he even told me exactly how to use an oil that i purchased from him and showed me some of the cool things he has picked up from around the world that are not for sale  this place is charming and a great place to find cool and unusual things in commercialized las vegas  oui oui
1,is my favorite place to shop for wine cheese and specialty gifts for friends i subscribe to their newsletter kristen and bob email customers when they have farm-fresh eggs or carrots in or special cheeses they also host classes about wine and cheese one class is on wines under $20 (or something like that) class sizes are small and they pair wines with delicious meats and cheeses shopping here costs me half the time as when i look for wines at trader joes or lees because everything is delicious and you can count on bob and kristen for suggestions we are so lucky to have this shop in henderson i suggest dropping in on fridays or saturdays between 4 and 7 that's when they have wine tastings
1,wine and cheese shop in the valley hands down thanks to the knowledge and care of the owners bob and kristin other local stores might carry bigger selections or beat prices by a dollar or two but bob and kristin will make sure you get the most for your money thanks to their personal recommendations and their desire to get to know each customer and their tastes their thursday wine classes are highly recommended too and definitely check out their free tastings on fridays and saturdays
1,i moved away from the valley over a year ago and i miss bob and kristin i only wish i could clone them and spread their copies across to other statescitiesregions to impart their wealth of knowledge on wines food and beer couple that with a passion for all things food and a cool mid-western friendliness*sigh* i can't say enough good things about them las vegas is lucky to have two of the most genuine and passionate people about food and wine anyone who hasn't visited their shop - much less talked to them asking them for any helpwell they're just missing out aren't theysure you can get some of the same stuff elsewherebut you really miss out on the character and the ambiance here they are soooooooo nice and will entertain your questions no matter how naive they are every week (frisat) they have wine tastings and they offer monthly classes (sign up early bc they fill up fast) on wine - from $20 to $50 per class sign up for the email newsletters too - you get the latest offerings from new seasonal wines cheeses candies etc want to request something or try the latest and greatest cheese ask them they even cut the cheese to your order - i wanted a small sliver just for myself and they had no problem want a gift basket for friends and family yup they do that too kristin will hand select items for you (even if you don't know what you want)but they are sooooooo accommodating and friendly that you don't have to worry about feeling intimidated by their selectionride your bike all over town and just need a place to rest they do that too i'm serious i used to ride my bicycle on saturdays tofrom lake mead in the sweltering dry heat of the lv summer on the way back i'd stop by their shop and they always offered me a glass of water and let me park my bike inside while i shopped when i moved away they even recommended places where i could get great cheeses and winessend in the clones
1,great little shop is out of the way for most people (located on horizon ridge and valle verde) but it is definitely the best place to shop for cheeses and cured meats in las vegas the owners are helpful and the selection is vast they recently added "to go" farm baskets full of organic vegetables so you can get almost everything you need for a dinner right here plus they have wine tasting classes be sure to get the artisan zzang chocolate bars they're fantastic
1,kiwanis club decided to have a wine tasting social and the girl who volunteered to put the event together did a google search and found valley cheese & wine for the location  little did she know that she had stumbled upon an amazing gem of a local business in the vegas area please bear with me because this experience is being recalled from over a year ago-i just thought i'd yelp about it because it is the reason i keep going back to this store about twelve people from our club rsvp'd and showed up for the event  we had a private wine tasting class in the back room-intro to wine tasting or something like that  bob was very friendly and unpretentious which is important because some people like to be wine snobs which is a total turn-off he started off talking about various kinds of glassware and how it affects flavor of the wine-demonstrating this to us with a sparkling wine in two different glasses we journeyed from sparkling white wine all the way through the reds and ended with a dessert wine  we also got to try some amazing cheeses and meats and olives that were to die for (lucques i believe)  in the end we received a discount on our purchases from the evening (everything we tasted) and i also bought some international treats from the shelf   the shop had a great selection of treats from all over the world and it reminded me of a locally owned trader joes-without the crazy nazi vegan hipsters running the place  (i can't impress how friendly and normal everyone in the shop is)i also signed up for the newsletter which comes regularly  they have frequent events and tasting classes you can sign up for-and the newsletter educates you a little on new products in the shop or upcoming events  they also save your purchase history so you can buy the same or similar wines when you come back  i also like that i can describe a wine and bob or his wife can ask you some smart questions to recommend a similar wine-and sometimes it is better than the one you were trying to getsupport local businesses-they need our help especially in this economy :)  valley cheese & wine is definitely worth the trip
1,the austrailian pink floyd show 2 times and a doo wop show once place was built when everyone was 5'5 150 lbsi am 6'3 270 lbs so its a toyt squeese for a 2 hour concert but the sound and just the atmosphere makes me forget my knees are loc ated behind my ears red carpet on the walls makes me get all giddy betcha a cat would go ape in a place like this hope its open forever
1,is by far and away my favorite theater in pittsburgh if you've ever been here you know how beautiful it is it's a historic landmark and was built in 1927 and restored in the 80's to it's original state it holds around 2200 seats and is the third largest stage in the country as you can see i'm a total nerd about this theaterso let me give you some big insider tips about seating avoid at all costs the outer sides of the left and right orchestra (the floor) in the front you can actually get a cheap seat if you sit in the back of the left and right sides but only sit on the aisle if an aisle seat isn't available go for first or second tier i would rather see the show from far away than half see the show the touring broadway pittsburgh clo pittsburgh opera and pittsburgh ballet theatre perform here so go support our local theater just remember it's right here in the burgh it's still a fantastic production and it's cheaper than a trip to nyc
1,valentine's day date experience i decided to book tickets for the dracula saturday matinee so that we could have a night out on the town after the show this theater is really exquisite prepare to go back in time to the decadence of the 1920'smarble sconces crystal chandeliers staircases and brass railings adorn the beautiful space take some time after the performance to tour the interior roomsthe ballet was immensely enjoyable in it's own right the back drops dark sinister and ethereal all at the same time the dancers floating gracefully around the stage as if their feet fluttered just above the ground classical music flowed into the hall and moved with the performers during the most intense scenes it was so romantic i can't wait to go againpricing is quite reasonable too you can go for the cheap seats for $20 on the top tier left or right of the center $50 for better seating towards the center or orchestra seating for $90 being the best seat in the house i love that on the website you can choose your own seats parking can be found two blocks away for $5 at the parking garage take some time out to visit this theater
1,benedum center for the performing arts was originally a movie theater called the stanley it was built in 1927 and was billed as "pittsburgh's palace of amusement" it's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built 65 cents would not only buy you a "photoplay" but you'd also get live entertainment too a two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the us department of the interior brought it back to its original condition the grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater only one is a replica in fact the main chandelier weighs 4700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide the sightlines here are awesome it truly is a masterpiece of theater design let's face it fellow yelpers you're not here for my architectural reviews are you okay i came here last night for the decemberists concert featuring justin townes earle as the opener there were only single seats left when i tried to get tickets so i ended up going by myself to the show hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion the portland or based decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their cd "the king is dead" has been doing quite well so much so that it reached 1 on the billboard charts in late january the decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called "progressive rock" and british folk but this new cd is definitely more of an americanaalt country sound so much so that the single "down by the water" reminds me of firetown's "the good life" for some reason (firetown later evolved into garbage--in both senses of the word but that's another story) so it was no surprise that after doing "the crane wife parts 1-3" colin meloy told the audience "i don't know who wrote the set list but they thought we were a prog band we're not a prog band anymore we're a folk band" hmmm that actually was a pretty apt description despite this they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue there was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though sam watkins of nickel creek played fiddle against jenny conlee's accordion and they did a rousing irish jig to the song "rox in the box" it was almost strange though how meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song "rise to me" they also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show and face it folks you can't keep a good prog band down but anyway this show proved that the decemberists aren't some flash in the pan their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul i should also mention that my 60-something father a music fan in his own right absolutely loves the decemberists now you know where i get those genes from as i mentioned justin townes earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar it should his father is the iconic steve earle (another one of my favorites) justin gets his middle name townes from townes van zandt of whom steve earle was a great friend justin townes earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father
1,always love coming to the benedum  we attended wicked on a recent sunday night  i am always astounded by the beauty of this theater  here are a couple interesting facts:  the mirrors marble and woodwork in the grand lobby are all original  there are over 90 crystal chandeliers torchieres and sconces in the theater all but one are original  the original cost was $3 million back in 1928  compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million  we had perfect seats row aa  how lucky is that  loved the performance  my first time for wicked  but just as entertaining is the view of theater  love it here  so beautiful and so ornate  and while the seats are showing some signs of wear the good news is the 2881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450000you know it always feels really special here  no matter what event we attend  looking forward to coming back during the holiday season
1,phantom when it came through grew up seeing nutcracker every year jc superstar was awesome beautiful place and pittsburgh is soooo lucky to have it
1,love it here it is like walking into a little piece of history i could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day furs and fedoras and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways this is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares i have not experienced large playhouses in other cities but my advice is pick a show you love a decent broadway one splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience i don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view and unlike heinz hall you have a little leg room there are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint the ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (grrr that pittsburgh parking) speaking of parking i would park at the 9th and penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can i appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions i think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other american cities has been left to decay cue in detroit sadly so props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going true pittsburgh beauty
1,was lucky to get a tour of the benedum last month and i was completely impressed  this is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details  it is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical the opera ballet or a concert  the staff is amazing and extremely professional they run this place like clockwork  i love the natural acoustics of the building although i don't recommend that you sit under the balcony that's the worst place to hear a good sound  don't worry about getting over-dressed for an event at the benedum this is a truly unique and beautiful landmark that exudes elegance
1,theater  absolutely beautiful  live the seating  seen book of mormon here  loved it
1,guys and gals   as you know i am a volunteer usher at the benedum last night seinfeld       tonight celtic thunder   i highly recommend buying a season certificate or a package deal to the benedum next year is great "wicked"is the the featured attraction    what a great christmas or birthday gift right      do check into it and buy
1,charlotteans don't realize that we have such a fabulous ballet company in residence here in our fair city it is led by artistic director jean pierre bonnefoux and his wife patricia mcbride who are world renowned for dancing in the new york city ballet under george balanchine what does that mean for non dance connoisseurs it means young dancers want to come to ncdt from all over the world (literally) to dance under their tutelage which translates to a better experience for patronsncdt has always has a great reputation for modern contemporary ballets but they also excel at classic storybook ballets like romeo & juliet and funny children's ballets like cinderella but their sweet spot (and why they attracted resident choreographer dwight rhoden who you may have seen on so you think you can dance) is the innovative contemporary works in fact their annual innovative works in late fall often sells out it features several short pieces that often have a theme or message  my favorite piece satto was featured again recently in director's choice was originally an innovative work another one they debuted this year had two male artists partnering with anna gerberich and never let her feet touch the ground the whole time the artists and choreographers ebb and flow but you're always going to see a great show with a wide variety of styles you may not like every single piece but at least they're conversation pieces similarly you're not going to love every painting in the mint it's worth seeing something other than nutcracker so dive in the water's fineif i have any complaint it's that every dancer has a different stylestrength and jean pierre seems to have favorite principals that he sometimes over casts kind of like john foxi grew up watching such dance companies as the sf ballet bolshoi joffrey ballet odc alvin ailey and the cincinnatisan jose ballets so this ain't my first rodeoladies one more selling point in two words: eye candy glistening muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless i'm just saying sue me
1,must go see the ncdt i just saw the fall show limitless and it was incredible i have enjoyed ncdt for years but this performance was on a whole new level
1,is fun yes it is tosca yesterday was amazing i was riveted through the whole thing - and at almost 4 hours (including 2 intermissions) that's saying something i was wowed by the singing enjoyed the sets was impressed by the acting and intrigued by the story floria tosca was superb scarpia and spoletto deliciously evil honestly i did not expect to like opera as much as i have but i've been enthralled with both az opera performances i've seen this year (the mikado and tosca) particularly tosca after the performance an opera q&a session was held for anyone wishing to stay the az opera head and tenor james flora answered questions about everything from the set the director's mindset the spoletto character's triumphant ending and the future of opera in the united states
1,i gave this one too many stars because nothing compares with houston's grand opera but the arizona opera is still good and definitely worth seeinghint:  if you come at 6 pm instead of when it starts at 7 pm you can hear a talk about the opera which will help you understand it better if you're a newbie  cool huhregardless you're either going to just love opera or hate it  i'm a lover  season tickets which includes the price of the parking garage at $8 (compared to $10 at the local garages)  i think the total bill ran $130 or $150  so worth it if you are one of the opera lovers
1,have seen aida on three occasions once several years ago in phoenix once in prague and yesterday again in phoenix my wife and i both agreed this was the best performance we have seem so far of this wonderful opera one thing we left with we hope we get to see it again and we hope when that time comes we will enjoy it as much as yesterdaywe will continue to support arizona opera and hope others do as well the performances are outstanding keep up the good work
1,lucia di lammermoorif you enjoy opera don't miss this wonderful performance put on by the arizona opera this was my first "lucia" and it greatly surpassed my expectations it is definitely an opera i would enjoy again we are so fortunate to have this available to us here in phoenix we flew out to la to see la boheme a few months ago and my wife and i both agreed that la opera doesn't have anything over the arizona opera keep up the good work folks
1,love going to the opera i am always impressed with the vocal range of the performers they can do amazing things with their voices and the sets and costumes are so elaborate that is the best part even though they are usually sung in a language that i don't understand you can really get swept up in the emotion of the music i usually read the program beforehand so that i know what's going on and then try my best not to stay fixated on the subtitles on the screen but instead just enjoy the action on the stage the orchestra and of course the singing
1,took my girlfriend here for a performance of romeo & juliet this was our second time going to the opera (we saw faust last year through yelp)  both performances we have seen here have been excellent - the cast is great and the location is very convenient this time our seats were very close which maybe was a bit too close there is a large board above the stage that provides translations (and since i speak english and she speaks spanish it would be helpful) our seats were really too close to benefit from seeing the screen fortunately the cast does an excellent job at bringing delivering the emotions of the scene well even if the audience doesn't know the language the coffeedrink bars and the props from other shows in the lobby also provide good relief during the intermissions the restrooms seem to move quicker than they do at other theaters in the area both times have been excellent and we will definitely return
1,saw tosca here last season and loved it  the electronic subtitles are great as otherwise i would be lost  the acoustics in the symphony hall are awesome and my seats were smack dab in the middle of the room with the perfect view  i like that you can bring your own bottled water and stuff too  at least i think you can no one stopped me or said anything  i think it's awesome that we have this cultural experience in phoenix
1,attended "la boheme" last night and it was beautiful gorgeous production - the performances sets costumes everything  it was glorious
1,boheme  was excellent for all we had to go through to see la boheme in la  (traffic) i will take az opera any day symphony hall is a much nicer venue than the la opera (smaller and more aisles) if only the downtown restaurants like the "butcher" were open on sundays we could include a nice lunch with a sunday matinee opera has been enduring for a long time it touches the soul i wish we had more young people that were willing to give it a try support your az opera it's one of the best deals in town
1,decent ballet in phoenixpinch mei have not been in the last year or so to one of the productions but ballet arizona has been a treat under ib anderson's direction  i'm a fan of the classical ballets and have loved their swan lake and giselle productions  this year's season is ending so i must repent and make a few shows next year
1,saw the all balanchine program saturday night -- going back sunday to see it againit's amazing to me that a ballet company can go from startup  to being a destination company is fewer than 20 years  but baz did it in 15next season is their 22nd and i renewed my season tix a couple of months agobaz is a 'must-see' every show
1,have done volunteer withe ballet az for the last years  it is a an accomplished company with a splendid school attachedthe first thing i can say is when most regional companies have gotten smaller ballet az keeps growing ib anderson the artistic director danced with balanchine in new york  he will not do a ballet that he doesn't know he his company can do and do well  in watching his him work i feel he has the ability to make everyone in the company feel what they have to offer is of great value from the newest member to the principal dancers  there is less "attitude" in this company than i have ever seen  the dancers are hard workers who want as good as what ib asks of them and that is a great deal  the people you don't see such as the people who do the costumes and the sets  do a remarkable job of making things happen that sometimes start as nothing more as idea of ib'swhen i first started working with this group i was surprised when i heard people say this and that was as good as they'd seen all over the world  i am not surprised now  ballet az has brought together dancers from all over the world due to it's excellent reputation these professionals have come to take advantage of working in an organization that is striving for something better each production than the one before   if in some areas phoenix has  long way to go in catching up in the arts the ballet is not one of them  we have a fine company here in az that continues to excel in presenting varied productions that range from the classics to world premieresprices are quite reasonable for what is offered  there are different packages that make it even more attractive with special prices on certain dates  contact the box office abut that  another way to see the shows is to join the volunteer organization  we work hard but the end result is the pleasure of knowing we help make a beautiful thing like ballet az blossom and grow
1,review is for the current production ending 4509 masters of movementwow what a great program  they led w the classic les sylphides but it was the 2 modern pieces that blew my socks off  polyphonia choreographed by christopher wheeldon had some incredible movements of balance and dexeterity that i turned to my sis who was attending with me and commented "i bet you and the irish hubbie do that in the bedroom" the final piece was the golden section from the twyla tharp ballet the catherine wheel twyla tharp collaborates with david byrne (talking heads)  fuuuunnnn the energy of that number with the dancers flying and the beat of byrne's music made that piece my favoritedavid byrne rocks
1,date and i attended the ib anderson's nutcracker last night  i hadn't seen the nutcracker since i was a little ballerina girl  it was an absolutely amazing performance with stunning set changes  the dancers were incredible and very fun to watch  i would recommend this event to people of all ages as a "must see"
1,really enjoy ballet arizona productions we recently saw the nutcracker - an annual family tradition they make a few modifications to the program every year i really liked the tweaks this year we also happened to attend a showing where astrit zejinati and chelsea wilcox doing the pas de deux they were absolutely amazing our 5 year old has also been taking ballet lessons at the school there since she was 3  we think the school is wonderful they teach classical ballet vocabulary from 3 years old on they are pretty strict and have a set curriculum they all wear the same uniform and hairstyle and are strict about it after the 3 year old class parent's aren't allowed to watch other than one class per session where they let us all in so far from what we've seen though the curriculum and the teachers are great they do a lot to improve body control teach musicality and start them on a course of classical balletwe're big fans
1,husband and i recently attended the balanchine classics performance we thoroughly enjoyed it and loved our 6th row seats at the phoenix symphony halljust the right distance from the stagethe orchestraphoenix symphony orchestrawere just wonderful and the dancers were amazing we will definitely be attending future performances featuring ballet arizonawe also could not pass up buying the angelina ballerina book and doll at the gift store for our future little ballerina
1,daughter has been attending classes here for about 5 years   super professional environment  very efficient staff   the classes and rehearsals and recitals are a joysaw the nutcracker for the first time this past holiday season and was blown away by the production values and the performances
1,the arizona ballet and their school of ballet
1,ballet arizona performance of giselle at symphony hall opening night last night and i have to say what a beautiful performance the music was perfect the story line was easy to follow i had received a program before it started but didn't look at it until intermission and i was able to keep up with everything that was going on  the dancers wow just beautiful to watch thank you ballet arizona for the beautiful performance look forward to seeing other productions in the future 
1,went to the ballet on saturday to see moulin roge  we have attended the ballet for years and this was one of the best performances we have ever seen  the costumes were unique and the story had some humor  the choreography and dancers were tremendousif you haven't yet experienced the pittsburgh ballet you are missing out
1,received a pair of free tickets through yelp to see the nutcracker last fri evening  i was very excited to see this show since i'd wanted to see it last last year but couldn't work it out with my (now ex-) boyfriend's schedule  i'm used to second tier seating at the benedum but i was in for a real treat since the tickets turned out to be for orchestra level (score)  what a great surprise for my birthday which happened to be that dayi really enjoyed pbt's performance of the nutcracker  between the dancing the choreography and the costumes and scenery i thought the show was excellent  i've never seen a live performance of the nutcracker before and the last time i saw the movie was in elementary school music class  even though it'd been this long i was able to follow the plot with very few problems  i enjoyed the pittsburgh-specific references in pbt's version of the show which included a setting at a mansion in shadyside and a heinz carriagei thought both acts were very good and each had advantages  the first act was easier to follow in terms of the plot but i enjoyed the dancing better in the second act which featured more of the principals and soloists  although the stage could get a bit crowded during certain scenes the scenes were ones where it was either appropriate in light of the plot (eg the party scene in the first act) or where it was difficult to avoid (the final scene of the dream sequence)  in general i found the visual impact of the show very pleasing--if you prefer more visually-oriented shows as my friend who accompanied me does this show would definitely be your cup of teaoverall i found pbt's performance of the nutcracker to be engaging and enjoyable and i'd definitely pay to see it again  while this was the first live ballet performance i've seen i thought that the dancing costumes scenery and choreography very good to excellent  i'm glad that this show is a christmas tradition in pittsburgh--it's definitely one that i plan on taking advantage of regularly in the future
1,fun  my oldest (5) and i ditched daddy and baby sister to come out for the 2014 production of nutcracker and it was delightful  our tickets (thank you yelp) were in the orchestra level and we had a great view of the production  i was surprised at how many other kids were in the theater and i think for the length and time of night i wouldn't have wanted to take anyone younger than my almost-six-year-oldso the ballet it was set in pittsburgh which was fun and there were some additions we hadn't see before like the mysterious nephew  the dancing was wonderful as expected  my daughter was confused about the lack of dialog but the program had a very helpful synopsis that helped her understand what was happening  the first act was fun with magic acts dancing "dolls" and of course the fight with the rats and mice and quite enjoyable  the ending of the first act was quite soothing and in the dark theater i admit i was afraid of snoozingthe second act  the national dances were amazing especially the arabian dance (holy cow talk about amazing abs)  then it got to the point where the sugar plum fairy danced then her consort danced then they danced together then the fairy dancedand it did drag a little  i loved the creativity though of the carousel and the imagination of the set and costumes  there was a part with the lambs that was awfully cute and we loved watching the kids any time they were on stage  there were several "side stories" going on in the periphery of the stage that you could get absorbed in and it was just very well done  overall i think that this will now be our christmas tradition  it was wonderful
1,daughter has been to several area dance studios this is a great studio the dance teachers are the best - she is in lyrical jazz tumbling and hip hop they are very well trained and create a positive environment while still pushing the kids to do their bestthe recital in dec was beautiful and so professionally done it was fun to watch and i was very impressed at how many talented dancers there were the owners work very hard and are passionate about what they do that is the most important thing to us it creates a very good environment for the students i would highly recommend this studio to anyone it is great now and will only get better as their business growsthank you steppin' out for providing a great dance studion in the west valley
1,love this place my daughter started taking balletjazz classes this year at 4 yrs old i was nervous because this was her first time taking instruction from a teacher but she is doing so well i know that i have her teacher ms marlo to thank for that she is soooo good with children all of the teachers i've seen have always had a smile on their face and you can tell their students love them yes some of the little ones are more "into" it than others and some are spinning in circles like one of the other reviewers mentioned but my 1 priority was for my daughter to have a fun and stress-free time learning how to dance and that she does other places i shopped around at seemed too serious and up-tight and it is more affordable than a lot of places another plus is that fellow parents are very nice and nothing like the crazies on dance moms : )
1,really love this studio  my daughter and son both started taking classes here last fall and we love everything about it so far  the recitals are well done my kids adore their instructors and they have learned a lot  there is not a crazy "dance mom" culture but just a great group of involved parents and there are some very talented dancers here  i especially appreciate the fact that they have a great boy culture here and my son adores this about steppin out and feels supported and accepted in all of his classes (so far hip hop tap and ballet)  in particular mr gabe's boy's hip hopbreak dance class is an outstanding class with nothing like it anywhere in the west valley  we searched high and low for a hip hop class that was geared more toward street style and break dance and feel so lucky to have found this class
1,studio classes are reasonably priced offer a wide variety of dances including ballroom salsa tango west coast swing and zumba instructors are extremely friendly and great teachers they have student rates
1,is our favorite y so far location is convenient and the staffs are really helpful and kids friendly  my kids are into soccer swim basketball and camp here  price are a little high for me being a single mother but everything else is great
1,have been going to casey at the bat since i was 13 years old  i am now pushing 30it has changed an itsy bitsy but really it's stayed the same in the last 15 years  still the same old ratty nets for the batting cage still the creaky pitching machines still the same crappy doors that swing open into the main room with the snack area but you know what  it's home and it's not supposed to be glitzy it's sports silly  you're supposed to get dirty
1,friendly atmosphere  low price from batting cages to team enter fees
1,love this speciality running store  if you're getting into some regular running want to start or need a good pair of running shoes definitely come here and get their expert advice  they'll get you fitted with a great pair of shoes have you run for them and really know their stuff  there's also a great stock of clothing and accessories  src also offers group runs and put together a great pre race tent for pf chang's rock n roll 12 marathon and maration  it may be hard to find back in that corner but definitely try them out
1,love this place it is so refreshing to walk into a store and have the employees truly understand and feel passionate about what they do after living in the neighborhood for 6+ years i am happy to have the scottsdale running company close by if you have large or unusual athletic shoe requirements you will find yourself in for a treat at this store forget the big box stores and give src a try
1,have purchased my past two pairs of running shoes from this store and i have no complaints from either of those experiences  the employees appear to be very knowledgeable and will help you find the most suitable pair of shoes for your running style and price point  although the shoe selection here isn't overwhelming there is a large enough variety to meet the needs of nearly every runner  additionally i never felt as though i was being pushed into the most expensive pair of shoes; that is reassuring because they carry some pretty expensive kicks  another great aspect of this neighborhood-type shop is that they offer running groups and training advice  so if you're thinking of entering some races or curious about ramping up your mileage the employees here are a great resource to tap into
1,can't believe the reviews that this place has received so far  wowi concede yes it is very expensive when compared to other gyms but a bmw is expense when compared to a fordin my life i've belonged to the courthouse (tiny gym) la fitness asu student rec center q fitness (now 24 hour fitness) and the ymca and i can honestly say that all pale in comparison to this facility  quick disclaimer: not all lifetime fitness centers are the same  the one in gilbert is great but not as amazing as this facility  when i moved to mn (home of lifetime fitness) i actually plotted out where we would live based on the proximity to one of their gyms  the closest one to me is in no way comparable to the facility in tempe and as a result we are no longer members  if i lived even remotely close to a facility like this one i would join again in a heartbeat  now on to the reviewmy wife actually signed us up under the family plan without me around  when she told me how much it was (~$90month for the entire family) i was a bit put back  but after my first visit i felt the money was well spent and that we were even getting a deali often describe this facility as a "country club"  everything about this place is just amazinglocker rooms - incredibly well appointed with a ton of space a lounge sauna and steam room  the lockers are large and their cardkey system saves a lot of time for those of us that always forget to bring a lock with themcardio - there's no way anyone can complain about this  even at peak times there are almost always machines available in every category (treadmill bike elliptical etc)  the machines are well maintained and the abundance of large screen tvs will keep you distracted from your achy legsweight machines - you name it they have it  there are more here than i would ever use but if you want to work that little muscle that connects those two things that you n ever use they probably have a machine here to do itfree weights - they have a ton of free weights with some set-ups that i have yet to find in other facilities  plenty of space to workout and plenty of weights for everyone to usebasketball - two full size courts that are open and clean  great courts to play onsquash - probably my one complaint is that they have squash courts and no racquetball courts  of course most would argue that squash is more technical than racquetball and i should get some skill and stop bitchingrock climbing - probably one of the most underused aspects of the gym  i rarely saw people on this but is was a heck of a set-uptennis - this was extra and since i'm not much of a tennis player i didn't sign up for this feature but it seemed like a nice facilitypool - indoor and outdoor pools so you can swim all year long  the outdoor pool had some amazing "scenery" during the warmer months  i wouldn't go so far as to compare it to a vegas hotel pool but it was darn impressivekid zone - this is one of the things that sold it for us  the facility for kids was outstanding with separate areas set up for different ages and an abundance of activities and areas for all kids  indoor lower hood basketball  outdoor play area  huge indoor "jungle gym"  computers  crafts  this truly was an amazing part of the gym  and the great thing is if you want to relax instead of work out this aspect of the gym becomes even more helpful  you want to get a haircut and a massage  drop the kids off and head to the spa  you want to sit back and relax  drop the kids off and head to the pool or hot tub  the kids look forward to it and it's great for the parentsspa - my wife used this more than me and was happy with the experiences that she had here  we didn't use it as much as we could have but no complaintscafe - decent food for a little cafe in a gym  i ate many a breakfast there on my way to work after a cardio session  overall i just don't think that i've ever been in a better gym  yes it's expensive but even at a higher price i feel as if i always got a good deal for the money i spent
1,bless lifetime fitnessfirst off let me tell you how much i despise working out  like at times i'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper  however ltf (have you noticed that i like to abbreviate  get used to it friends)  makes my gym experience fairly painless  steve w i salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment and i actually have many of the same opinions but because i like to hear myself talk i'll reiterate some of my favorite pointsfirst off i'm absolutely not a fan of children  especially at a gym  lifetime has free childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming  kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing  they love it  and i do too  waterslides  i mean come on  loveitloveitlifetime's members span the board which is nice because i like the fact that i'm not the most out of shape person there  i also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper  you may even see a professional athelete or tv personality on occasion  who doesnt love thatyou never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines  and they are not covered in meathead sweat which is always nicemy favorite part of ltf is the group classes  excellent teachers classes every day of the week and a good variety of options  i'd like to see more coreographed classes like hip-hop but whatever kickboxing jam is pretty damn close   locker rooms are always spotless towel service is free sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute  ingenious  i've been a member of a ton of scottsdale gyms but i drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the tempe ltf  doesnt road rage burn calories anyway  win-win situation
1,in love with ltf  when i joined i was just over 300 lbs and terribly out of shape  but i never felt out of place or uncomfortable  there were plenty of people in all stages of fitness so i didn't stand out at all   that helped tremendouslymost of the classes are mulit-level so you can join in and work on your fitness level without feeling intimidated  the hydro training class is amazing  classes are scheduled 7 days a week with hours to fit all schedules  instructors are helpful and motivating never judgementalmy son is 12 so he's old enough to do his own thing  i never worry about his safety in this huge facility  i don't have a lot of experience with the childcare but i've heard nothing but positives  i only wish this place had been around when my son was youngerthe facility is always clean and even at peek times there are plenty of machines available  they limit enrollment to ensure thisit may be a bit on the pricey side as far as most gyms go but the services and amenities are far far superior to any other gym in my experience  tons of classes indooroutdoor pools with slides hot tubs saunas steam rooms nice locker rooms free towel service tennis racquetball squash rock climbing basketball volleyball spa cafe etc etc etc  what more could anyone want  i'd gladly pay twice as much for all that we enjoy at ltf  it keeps me motivated and interested in a variety of workout options which keeps me coming back regularly
1,but waaaaaay worth itjust the best fitness center bar none
1,i am poorand lifetime is the reason for it  but you know whati don't carei heart lifetime fitness  it is the only gym that i actually feel comfortable working out in  they never tried to upsell me on packages  my sales manager (who works in scottsdale) is the best  but on top of everything elsei love my trainer  (this is why i am poorbut i love him so)  he is the best and believe mewhen the manager was choosing a trainer for methey knew what they were doing   matt is the best  he is so worth iti am going to have my first experience with the classes tomorrow and i have signed up for volleyball (hint hintthey need more players)  the lifespa is awesome and the life cafe has the best chicken pesto sandwich in the world  everybody is so friendly thereand the whole gym is extremely cleananother thing that i like  i cannot complain in the least
1,pay almost $120 month in fees for our family of 5 but it is sooooo worth it  just the two hours per day of free childcare for my 3 kiddos is worth it  i love the group fitness classes the place is always clean and pretty well stocked  the cafe has yummy smoothies and the pool is lush  what else could you ask for in a gym
1,gym has spoiled me they have all the right classes at all the right times even when it's packed there's always an open machine sometimes there's a wait for the weight machines the  locker rooms are always super clean and the staff is just awesome totally worth the $50 membership
1,love this place so very clean professional staff and a ton of machines so you never have to wait for anything locker rooms have hair dryers towels and a wet sauna outside there is the pool area with chairs for napping lanes for swimming laps areas for smaller kids and also a slidespa offers massages facials haircuts etclifecafe has shakes to sandwichs to googles if you're like me and forget them at home
1,really happy with this gym  would highly recommend it to anyone the group fitness classes alone are worth the membership costs even if you only go a few times a monthi also like the lifecafe restaurant insidei love the pesto chicken salad (if you need extra protein after your workout tell them to throw in some spicy peanuts sooo good with that salad)
1,fitness is the bomb how do i know this because i have worked out at probably 100 different gyms during my 8 years of traveling the country playing minor league baseball at lifetime you get what you pay for and lifetime is not cheap it's always meticulously clean stocked with towels and has plenty of free and pay for classes if you like classes if you wanted to you could literally spend the whole day at lifetime at have everything you need from the cafe pool child care (max 2 hours) hair and nail salon free wifi lounging area in the locker room with couches and a flat screen tv jacuzzi sauna etc etc etc if you don't mind the price 40mnth for a basic membership you will love lifetime and never want to work out anywhere else
1,took my 2 sons here to try out the batting cages  this place is amazing  the staff is great it is wonderful environment and my kids have so much fun in the batting cages  we also have done lessons and will continue to do them  it is amazing how much they have learned from just a few months of wob training  i would highly recommend it
1,was driving by the baseball school a few weeks ago with my sons neil and joel and i asked them if they wanted to check it out and my oh my did they have the day of their lives they already knew how to hit balls but now they really smack 'em my sons have been asking me everyday when we get to go back next so i love this place makes my daddy duties easier
1,than video games i take my boys there and they love it it's airconditioned and great exercise they are continually improving and excited about little league next year
1,a single mother and brought my small son in to world of baseball to see if someone could help him as i had no clue how to teach him to hit a ball the guys who work there were so excited about a little guy wanting to play and took us straight away into a hitting room to hit off of a tee we came in a few days a week for about half an hour and practiced hitting on the tee but he was getting a bit bored the instructor noticed his lack of excitement at the tee and changed up the teaching by the end of the second week my little son was in the batting cage (of course the slowest one) hitting balls he wasn't scared he wasn't nervous he wasn't upset when he missed the guys made sure the pitching machine was set perfectly for his size and everyone was super excited for him when he hit one then two three four five and six balls i couldn't believe it the older kids in there training are very kind to my son and i they are super encouraging and excited to see such a little boy in with them doing "big boy" things we're going to be there every week forever my son looooves it and said he wants to "wiv [live] at the baseball school
1,is more than a bunch of batting cages  this is where you learn to hit  wolfe is my son's instructor he is a natural coach you can tell he loves baseball and hitting  they have an area for soft toss tee and live pitching as well as machines  if  you have a membership it's all available to you whenever you want not just during lessons
1,staff here is great my son loves his monthly membership
1,over in arizona from ireland for a few weeks work and as i play hurling in ireland i always wanted to have a go at baseball so i dropped by here for the closest thing to it this place was as we say in ireland "un-feckin-real" the guys working there deserve a lot of credit as they were willing to point a baseball virgin like me in the right direction to pop my batting cherry they chose a suitable bat for me and after two or three shots advised me that i needed to switch my hands which made a huge difference to my batting i would and most likely will be back numerous times before i ship back out to ireland as this place is top notch in every aspect
1,mind what i have to saymy kid loves this place whether swinging by to hit balls in the cages or for baseball camp my youngest thinks this place rocks oh in the summer this is the coolest place in town ac and batting cages are a blessing during 110 degree days the staff is always helpful they treat the kids well even while maintaining a little baseball tradition of goofing on ya a bit it's perfect for both boys and young ladies great skill and confidence building we'll be signing up for some private coaching this year hopefully with coach dude" or coach "redbeard"

1,wait to see them destroy the red wings over the next 10 years
1,very first time i got together for thanksgiving with my boyfriend's entire family we went to see the penguins  we had awesome seats awesome service and a nice surprise when a welcome sign with the family's names came up on the screen  even though they lost by 1 in ot it was an awesome experience to see such die-hard fans with their families around the holidays
1,hockey is the single greatest sport to watch live  it is fast physical the game can turn on an instant can be offensively explosive or a defensive struggle and the fans at a hockey game are "highly emotional"the pens and their fans have come a long way and right now they are one of the best fan bases in the nhlon a side note imo the nacho's at the mellon arena are the best nacho's in the world  maybe it has something to do with the environment
1,a fave even from the days of the original powder blues of les binkley ron shock and ken schinkel throw in the ultra yellow unis when mario came aboard and hoo ha lookin' good there randy carlyleloved the fact during the cup years they were the first team with a bunch of players with big 's (55 larry murphy 92 rick tocchet 68 jaromir jagr and 66) had a blast at the igloo--great location cool design hope the new arena measures upnow throw in sydney crosby and evgeni malkin nowadays and it's a team that always is entertaining to watch as the beloved bob johnson said "it's a great day for hockey" and it always is when the pens take to the ice
1,wouldn't you love 'em
1,off i will have to say that i am not into professional sports or actually i take that back and say that until i moved to pittsburgh i was not into professional sports then i moved from hawaii to pittsburgh pa and my opinion and my world was changed foreveri have lived in pittsburgh for 10 years and when i moved here i knew what i getting into moving into a sports town in hawaii the only thing sports-wise is college sports there are no professional teams at all i was very reluctant to give any of my attention to the steelers why i don't particularly care for football then something changed i casually started watching penguins hockey games when i say casually i mean whenever i saw there was one on tv and there was nothing else to watch and then after the lockout things changed i started watching any hockey games whenever they were on now i am so addicted that hockey has really become such an important aspect in my life everything else now takes a backseat to hockey i actually started dating a guy who did not like *any* sports on tv but now loves the penguins too i have to say that over the last few years the penguins have brought so much joy into my life and i am so happy that they won the stanley cup while i was living here i don't know how long i'll be living in pittsburgh but i do know that i will be a penguins fan for life let's go pens thanks for the memories and i look forward to many more
1,a fun night  6 to 3 win over the thrashers and all the fans threw their hats just in case crosby had a hat trick (which it looked like he did for a moment)  the first period was so action packed that i thought to myself even if they lost i would still enjoy every minute of the game; however thank the hockey lord they didn't lose because that makes it even better  the penguins have sold out every game for the last 188 games they announced  it is truly a fun experience to be right there watching the players in action  no fights tonight that was my only minor grumble  if you can (and buy your tickets early) so to a game
1,the steel city is known for football but three stanley cups ain't shabbythe penguins as an organization are awesome they do numerous charity events and take being part of the community seriously for all the problems with young players in professional sports leagues (cough ben cough) the penguins have strayed away from the dramaas for the hockey itself its great the new era of hcdb and young core makes this team exciting to watch and reinvigorates the sport itselfif you go to consolieum eat some nachos (filling and worth their price) and get some cotton candy from the old cotton candy man (oh you will know who i'm talkin' bout when you get there) and enjoy the gameside note: there has been criticism about the location of the arena in the immediate neighborhood but other problems have plagued the area which i find difficult to pin on one hockey organization (as the arena is used for much more than just hockey)
1,sports team of all time growing up i liked sportsloved boys playing sports and after trying my hand at cheerleading decided i didn't fit in with the conformation of cheering in a group i was the bane of the squad because i actually watched the game and jumped up out of turn to go crazy and scream during riveting finals tournaments yup i "ruined the cheer"  i was too hyper to be a cheerleader and ended up becoming a stats girl instead a much better role for when the game was nail bitingly close i could yell and jump to my hearts content this being said i love watching sports and hockey was the logical choice that would make it the ultimate sports viewing experience in my eyes i mean hockey guys kick ass the skills it takes ice skating with that tiny puck the fighting come on in college and highschool i went to many games and when i moved to pittsburgh going to the pens games became one of the best times i would look forward to when i first moved we weren't doing so hot so the games were affordable and easily attended so my love of the pens did not grow from fair weathered admiration we have the best team in the league and soon after  we won the cup love love love it's such a "livable" city that it's possible to run into these athletes all over town i won't give away where i've seen practically the whole team on many nights surrounded by puck bunnies soooget out there  it's fun to see that some of them are respectable young men and behave unlike many the football player sorry stillers the pens are number 1 lets go pens
1,350th review goes to my second favorite sports team the pens talk about a team with its ups and downs bad owners bad management a record of terrible draft picks even the mascot died true story in the early days when the penguins wore blue everyday they had a live penguin who would walk on the ice between periods well it died a promising rookie also died the same year in a car accident the penguins seemed like a team with a curse attached to it untilin 1984 the penguins were the worst team in the league finishing dead last but what a year to finish last we earned the first pick in the entry draft which brought current co-owner and the greatest player to ever lace up skates mario lemieux finally our luck was changing and mario brought two stanley cups to the city of champions but again the curse was back more bad management bad draft picks and chapter eleven gave mario the chance to co-own the team could history repeat itself again the penguins were one of the worst teams in the league and winning the draft lottery earned the right to draft sydney crosby a year earlier they drafted geeno malkin giving them the two best players in hockey a few years later sid the kid hoisted the stanley cup and brought pittsburgh it's third cup then the penguin's home began to crumble and needed a new place to play kansas city lured the pens with a new hockey rink las vegas also wanted them could we lose our pens finally the city and state came up with the cash to build the penguins their new home now lets bring the cup back to pittsburgh and party all summer long
1,you're headed to scottsdale and looking to play some golf make a trip out to quintero golf and country club this course is a little ways off the beaten track but it will be an experience you'll remember (temporary clubhouse only) this course is semi-private and if you're not a member you need to buy a "troon card" to be able to make a tee time worth every penny though because it is rated in the"top 100" courses in america and truly a remarkable golf experience
1,just opened it to the public they limit the number of tee times so play was very fast the greens were very very fast in my oppinion its the best course in the west valley
1,course has been on my radar for awhile but just a bit out of my price range but i decided to make this a "tax return splurge" for myself and could not be happier with my decision  every hole is different  the staff is excellent  the greens while a little marked up putted true and very fast  and at a rate of $110 from their own website (booked a week in advance and cheaper than golfnow btw) it's a far better value than your standard north scottsdale courses and equal to or superior in quality  a couple negatives; sand was a bit compacted and a couple tee boxes were hard to find a level spot  also if the ball gets into the desert get a new one      i will play this one more time in "season" and several times this summer  don't miss this  it will eventually go totally private at some point
1,36 holes here with a group of friends on a golf trip recently this is by far the best course we played during the trip we rented a house in cave creek so the drive was about 35 minutes to quinteroso worth itthis rees jones designed course is a challenge fair incredibly well laid out and an amazing value we played the grayhawk raptor course and i can say without question quintero puts it to shame for the money grayhawk is a great layout but for the money it is not even close if you are into golf and in the area do yourself a favor and make the trip to quintero
1,beautiful course  one of the nicest i've ever played at
1,always take my golf visiting buddies to this beautiful golf course  yes it's a little further out but it's well worth the drive  immaculate course great layout & terrific service  (troon golf should send this team to troon north  to teach the boys at tna little about how to deliver great customer service) my favorite public course in az  2  dove mountain  3  boulders south  sorry troon north   you need to improve service at every level to make your way back to the top inspite of your beautiful courses
1,had the pleasure of playing quintero twice and when ever i go to az i will make it a point to play there again it is my favorite course in the area and i always recommend it to friends that are traveling in azfain efairfield ca
1,place rocks  every hole looks like another high end course's signature hole  we loved everything about this place from the service to the driving range and the gps on the carts etc  also the cart girls were perky and friendly  one even helped us find a lost ball and gave my buddy a couple of pro v1s  probably the best course we have played
1,public course in phoenix in my opinion   every hole is picturesque and feels like what desert golf should be: penalties for missing but not so narrow that you have to hit an iron off every tee  the elevation changes make the course a joy to play and has been in great shape every time i've played it   the only annoyance is the drive in the cart from the club house to the first tee  cool factor for having a gold simulator in the bar now
1,is a beautiful and we'll manicured golf course  it is quite a drive to get there and a ten minute drive to get to the first hole  there are only about 6 homes on the entire course  there are many  holes with tremendous elevation changes on the par threes it is a tough course but fair there are very few players and the pace of play is good unless your game is off their food is excellent and reasonably priced
1,all i can sayits only water spraying out but if u really get into it its very touching and romantic  the music water the bellagiospeechless
1,would like a job choreographing the water  how does one make that happeni'm a fan of the sinatra and some of the opera routines but the other ones have got to go (bleh)i've already choreogrpahed a number to 'clark gable' by the postal serviceand i seriously need a job  this one would be perfect if it wasn't in las vegas  (bleh)
1,first experience was during the day and i was on the side of bellagio and facing the eiffel tower that was pretty wonderful and i got some great shots they played a sinatra song and towards the end i (and everybody standing near me) got a light "bellagio fountain" shower that was unexpected but felt kind of goodthe second experience was at night and i was on the other side (next to fountains but on the paris side) the show was lovely and bellagio looked quite lovely all lit up more great pictures no shower but the song they chose was some super-patriotic one that i didn't like that much ah wellthe shows are very short but i think they're definitely worth the ~5 minutes of standing and watching
1,dear fountainsyou were a wonderful companion my room at the bellagio gave me a wonderful view of you at all hours of the dayyour many songs and beautiful lights enticed me everytimei was very sad when it was too windy for you to come out and play
1,to say goodbyethat's all i'm sayingives me goosebumpsthis fountain soothes my soul
1,lighting great music great choreography i stayed at the bellagio and found myself walking to s vegas blvd just to check out the fountain show if you enjoy the show check out the fontana bar inside of the bellagio and request for outside seating trust me you wont be disappointed
1,is one of those things you simply must see in las vegas  of the free experiences on the las vegas strip this is the bestthere are several songs that they rotate and the show takes place every 15 minutes during the day and into the evening  if you stay in one of the bellagio rooms facing the fountain you can listen to the music on your television5 stars for being amazing
1,amount of water wasted in desert free unbeatable deal for a show unbelievable when you think about where you are seeing this the shows are every hour on weekdays and every half hour on weekends see it several times during the evening since the lighting is creative and the soundtrack changes with every show
1,is by far the classiest thing in las vegasand it's free i would probably pay to see this but i'm glad that i don't have to
1,a must if your on the strip its awesome to see me and the hubby always come to watch everytime we are in vegasif you can check out the show from the eiffel tower its awesome at night and you can get some beautiful pictures by the waythe show ends at midnightwe learned this the hard waywe stood there from 2am to 330am waiting for the showlolwhat dumb assesbut hey believe it or not we were not the only ones waitinglolthey should seriously consider posting a sign somewherelol
1,husband and i stayed here for a weekend getaway what a neat place it's a european style hotel (read very nice but smaller rooms) it used to be a monestary back in the day built around the turn of the century it has neat large old molding and furnishings owner was very nice offers complimentary wine in the evening and good full continental breakfast all of that for only $135 a night a short ride from everything includes free parking
1,was so lucky to stumble upon the priory i came to pittsburgh for a conference the westin at the convention center was booked so i had to find alternative lodging and came across this place i love this hotel  the historic building is beautiful  the beds are comfortable the staff are very friendly and helpful  they have a wonderful free continental breakfast in the morning  it's near bars and restaurants a nail salon and a grocery store (i was surprised to find that beer is not sold in grocery stores in pennsylvania  luckily you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk which is open 24 hrs) the local pizza place delivers until 2 am  it's walking distance to the andy warhol museum  also it's only a 2 minute drive from the convention center and much cheaper than the westin  i paid $105night the tv was very small and the water pressure was weak but everything else exceeded my expectations
1,love the prioryi don't remember how we found this place but i feel so lucky we did  a beautiful restoration of a lovely old building the priory is a comfortable tasteful beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city  we found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating plenty of help and advice for weary holiday travelers always delivered with a smile  we will return to the priory
1,thing pittsburgh is not known for but should be is turning old churches into businesses homes and even bars (gasp)  most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space  this is no exception as it's just so unique inside if you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's not a marriott or hilton this is the place you'll want to stay  it's fashioned like a european boutique hotel plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like wifi a shuttle and continental breakfast (score) it's also a really lovely place to have an event  for smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers  i really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range  if i would have gotten married in pittsburgh this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception  the grand hall is just gorgeous  it has the original church organ and stain glass windows  when it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair the northside of town where it's located has walkable access to the andy warhol museum the mattress factory museum the children's museum the national aviary the carnegie science center pnc park (home to the pirates go bucks) and heinz field (home to the stillerz as we call them in the burgh)  some are farther than others but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season  in the summer go for the walk so you can take in the sightsthere's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on east ohio river boulevard which is two streets up from the hotel  my suggestions would be bistro to go and bistro soul rita's italian ice (personal fave) or the priory bakery for dessert  there's also legends north shore not far on e north ave about two streets up from e ohio and amani coffee shop and cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch   it's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because everything is within walking distance  plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along e ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the aviary  the big kayaking organization venture outdoors is right under the 6th st bridge next to pnc park  you're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour  it's a great way to see the citythis is your place for one unique stay i wouldn't steer you wrong
1,stayed here twice during recent trips to pittsburgh and while the city itself is a bit hit and miss the priory is always comfortable and welcoming a great place to escape after a long drive or a stressful drive around the maze of roads and traffic that make up pittsburgheach room is pretty unique and always well appointed and very clean the staff are friendly and helpful with whatever you might need and it's an easy drive to most of the attractions around town
1,here for several days during a very rainy time the hotel is great very charming and fun to stay at definitely not your typical chain hotel as it's an old-style mansionthe continental breakfast was delicious the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful the amenities were wonderful (fast wifi) like others said it felt more like you were part of a fun community due to the interactions with the staff the small great bar downstairs and the welcoming atmosphere the fitness center was well equipped as well and there was a great complimentary shuttle the driver would not only take us to restaurants but would suggest other cool places to visit overall i could not recommend this more the only "negative" is the area where it is doesn't have many other fun places - but they are a short drive away
1,european style boutique hotel  you can not beat this hotel for the money
1,attended two weddings here  both have been amazing  the facility is really nice  the bathrooms are nicewhere this place shines is the food  the food i've had at the weddings has been amazing  the steaks are well prepared the chicken is awesome and the mushroom entry for vegetarians is amazing  both wedding cakes (vanilla and red velvet) have also been awesomei don't know anything about price but i really enjoy attending weddings here
1,banana cream pie pancakes are awesome all the food was delicious though it's crazy that they don't take reservations but it was worth the wait
1,a doubt one of the nicest places i have ever had the pleasure of laying my headhaving wine and cheeseor breakfastingthe inn on negley is gorgeously appointed  the individual rooms all named for varieties of apple are spectacular  we were in the lovely northern spy  the bed was wonderfully comfortable the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious  l'occitane bath products smelled divine  the shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the pittsburgh doingsbreakfast each morning cooked by the hospitable chef jackie is pure pleasure  each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning what time you'll be eating and drop it off in the dining room  the next day jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate the pastry of the day and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee  omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs  irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery  toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious  breakfast meats are lean and filling  afternoons iced tea and cookies are set out and in the evenings wine and cheese served  enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch relaxing on the back deck retreat or in the privacy of your room  staff is not only eminently professional but warm and gracious  heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (i will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at soba)  if you ever find yourself in pittsburgh lodgings can't get much better than the inn on negleythat's probably sufficient gushing
1,has a four seasonsfrom paris to shanghai london to bangkok the care with which this little b&b operation is run in pittsburgh exceeds the best that i have experienced in any of these citiesit may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel the business center or in-house spa but as a b&b this is about as good as it gets the structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house') is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match these are far from our tastes but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have the tvs aren't even old flat screens but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitanewhere this place really shines is in the staff and the food i actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties when was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysthey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary on this last visit i indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs i forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins on each visit they mix these up for this december visit they did gingerbread cookies (of course) the chef (jackie) from nyc could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurantthere is no elevator so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room the 1st floor room has double doors so i didn't find it any noisier than the others you are in a city and on a reasonably busy street so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back)
1,recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect  heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails the inn itself is gorgeous and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating a++++
1,returned from a three day weekend at the inn with 12 sorority sisters from around the country  it is understandable why the inn gets such rave reviews  from the extraordinary service of the staff which was both accommodating and anticipating to the beautifully furnished and outfitted rooms  (i stayed in the braeburn on the first floor which was large comfortable and filled with light) to the delicious breakfasts it was an outstanding experience all around  i am thrilled to spread the word and recommend your inn without reservation
1,a wonderful location  my sister's future mil hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people we had our own private room  it was tastefully decorated and beautiful  the inn on negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there as wellthe tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious  they even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and i loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around  the food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot sconeswhat a lovely spot for afternoon tea and i look forward to returning again to pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time
1,requested a stay at the inn on negley when traveling on business back to pittsburgh  i lived in town for 5 years and had not had an opportunity to return in more years than that i am afraid this place was just what i needed i sought a more personal experience than a canned commercial hotel could offeri was so grateful to get to stay in this pristine classy comfortable inn the staff was welcoming sweet helpful and kind the room was lovely the best part was waking up in the morning breakfast made me feel like a queen on her birthday the food was perfect gorgeous and delicious the carefully cut fresh fruit salad coffee french toast option and housemade pastries were top shelf the  creative meals and fresh ingredients were professionally planned carefully prepared and out of this world i bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous the treatment is i'd return in a heartbeat
1,for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time  the inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunchservice is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant  the brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit breads entree dessert  and you also have you choice of juices coffee andor teaall the things we tried were delicious  there were so many things i can barely remember  they also serve afternoon tea which i'm sure is fabulous so that's definitely next on my list
1,time having afternoon tea time in the states this place is very beautifully decorated we had the earl grey and peach ginger tea they were really good and the tea stand was amazing
1,absolutely loved our stay at the inn on negley there is so much to review and not enough space to do it we stayed in the cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet it was a room off by itself which i was unaware of at the time of booking that made it so much better the bed was extremely comfortable the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular the only part i didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning the breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental there were eggs belgian waffles pancakes etc to choose from each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry the service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive the staff was one of the most polite and courteous i've ever encountered thank you so much for making our stay perfect i hope to visit again some day
1,a non-native pittsburgher i would say the sunnyledge brunch tops grand concourse  not in the quantity but in the service and the ambience  it's funny how often i passed by this place turning onto fifth coming down from wilkins but didn't try it until my last weekend in pittsburghi came here on my last sunday in pittsburgh after i had posted a list of things i wanted to do before leaving  the sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas  along with this deal we had an incredible brunchthe 4 of us were sat on the porch overlooking fifth which wasn't that loud  the brunch came with an entree and a buffet  i love perfectly-sized portions and this one was it  i had a lobster club sandwich which was great  the brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby which was quaint and small  caviar  small pastries  just the perfect balance of sweet and savory  even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy (one of the few places that i saw valet parking) i never felt that i was treated any less (i was a poor graduate student with a love of food)the only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped  i had to struggle with getting out of my chair each time to go to the buffet  but this was a small negative compared to my experience at sunnyledgei hear that sunnyledge is known for their cocktails as well as their stay  next time i am in pittsburgh i would like to try out the boutique hotel  but until then i would highly recommend this brunch
1,aunt was visiting from chicago and booked a room at the inn after the vanlandingham estate (which is a sister business to the morehead inn) said they were fullwhen i dropped her off i went inside to check it out and i'm glad i did  it's truly an amazing house   walking around the place you can really start to feel as if you've gone back in time  i only saw one guest room but it was impressive  very well appointed with antique furniture it had a separate sitting room with its own couch and the views were of the thick stand of trees to the east and south of the housei also really liked the enclosure of live australian finches downstairs  they're colorful lively things to watch and i was told that sometimes the cat they keep around the house just sits around staring at the birdsanyway if you've got guest coming from out of town who are into antique and ornate surroundings they would do well to stay at the morehead inn
1,place is so relaxing and quiet the staff is very nice and accommodating the grounds are very beautiful and i was able to walk to a nearby shopping center without any issue i am staying in a room that has a balcony and a swing - so relaxing very nice b&b fits well into the southern hospitality feel of charlotte
1,you need a place for a company get together this is it  i was able to visit the morehead inn for a small company meeting of around 20 people and it was nice and cozy in the room they provided us withwhen i first arrived i noticed how it the plants were well kept and there wasn't that much parking  if you come here i would highly recommend carpooling  from the parking lot i was able to walk right to the conference room they had for us  as soon as i walked in i felt like i went back in time  the decorations there were beautiful and made me feel like i had to drink tea with my pinky out  the only gripe i have about their decorations was that they had plates with slytherin colors  how can they support the evil house in harry potter  other than that everything was perfectthey do not have that many bathrooms but it is understandable since it is an old house  i wouldn't want them to change that anyways  i wasn't able to explore more in the inn but all the things i was able to see i loved  the staff was also very friendly so kudos to that
1,immaculate historic estate- very spacious stay in the mt vernon room wonderful breakfast- great friendly staff
1,have no idea why no one has reviewed this awesome b&b but i'm excited to be the firstperhaps no one wants to let anyone in on the secretand i thought about not writing the review for that same reason but i have to share this one with my fellow yelpsters i wanted to celebrate the wife's bday with a quick getaway but didn't want to stay in the usual hotel so i popped "lgbt friendly b&bs" into google and this place came up they had a few rooms to choose from but of course the one with the hot tub in the room caught my eye first i emailed them through the website and the owner craig got back to me quickly i reserved the room and then just had to wait until the day arrived even though we were arriving earlier than the 3pm check in craig was awesome and left a personalized letter and the keys to the house in the mailbox for us to let ourselves in we put our stuff in the room and when we came downstairs the owners craig and cathy were there and welcomed us to the house even remembering that we were there for a surprise birthday trip the house was clean and the room was nicely done it was definitely more cozy than any hotel room could have ever been the bed was so comfortable we almost napped thru our dinner reservation the hot tub was definitely the highlight of the mentor room the massage jets were awesome and were so relaxing in the am craig made an awesome breakfast complete with bacon an egg souffle and a homemade kringle that was absolutely delish i couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate my gf's birthday from the second i made the reservation until the moment we checked out craig and cathy made us feel at home and provided top knotch service to us if i'm ever in need of a quick getaway to madison i know exactly where i will stay
1,hotels  after this cozy little place i'm a bed and breakfast faithful  our host craig was wonderful  it was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful  the place itself gave me the same joy i remember having when i would go see grandparents as a child  that feeling of a warm house  oh did i mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning  the bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing  we stayed in the sorenson room which was a little larger and had a couch  they offered a small bookshelf of books and madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day)  the sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure)  shampoo soap body gel bath salts (i think that's what they were) and even a hairdryer are all provided  this was nice since we forgot a couple of those things  for the breakfast portion we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche i've ever had  pardon my french my fiance is a vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make  he also had a myriad of drink options  some ready to be poured some in waiting  also for me (the non-vegetarian) he made an incredible side of bacon  it was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered  then it was baked  then it was devoured with great speed  seriously this was heavenly  also there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us craig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation  he is a true gentleman and an excellent host  my fiance and i are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again  i could't recommend this place enough
1,a wonderful place craig runs so happy we chose to stay at the parsonage for a girls weekend to madisonthe highlights:- location: while the b&b is about 25 minutes from downtown madison it's very easy to get to the perk of being off the beaten path is well being off the beaten path - price: the three of us chose the top floor reverend's retreat which can actually sleep up to 6 it had the feel of your parent's attic but in a good comfortable way for the friday & saturday night it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in madison- food: oh my goodness can craig cook the breakfasts alone would've been worth $20person at a restaurant definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again - the company: on the weekend we were there we (late 20searly 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in madison and craig and his wife have two lovely dogs if you're in town definitely look up & consider the parsonage
1,8 year old daughter and i stayed at the b&b this past weekend  we stayed in the sorenson room which was the right size for us  it had an attached good sized bathroom which was great and my daughter loved that she got to take a bath in a tub that was over 100 years old  (the water pressure is great by the way)  there was an assortment of soaps shampoos bubble baths etc in the bathroom too  the room and bathroom were clean and spotless  craig was extremely nice helpful and whipped up a killer breakfast a brown sugary apple cranberry upside down baked french toast kind of concoction homemade pumpkin bread fresh watermelon and sausage links  he was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about  the price was very affordable and the next time i'm in the area i'll be staying there instead of a hotel  : )
1,staying here  we were going up to madison for the day and found this place through a quick google search of madison-area b&b's  craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when i called to inquire about prices and availability  he was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (i'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love  when we got to the parsonage i was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in madison proper  it was quiet and cozy  we picked the mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow but i bet will be awesome when spring comes)   our bed was so comfortable i think i actually miss it  since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub) i used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy  breakfast the next day was so nice  craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy  everyone else got delicious smelling bacon and craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage  there was also pineapple juice and a really great tea selection  the conversation was also really nice - i like that we all ate together (me my boyfriend craig and the 5 other guests who were staying there  great people and great company  next time we are in the madison area we will definitely stay here  craig thanks for all the hospitality  from denise and justin
1,was a perfect fit for my recent trip what it is: warm quaint charmingly old affordable homey accommodating of diet what it is not: posh uber-modern sleek extravaganthas wifi has a (very well-mannered & clean) dog street parking does not have private bathrooms for each room so be sure to check on that when booking if it's important to youcraig the owner and coriander the springer spaniel were a warm greeting party craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house the amenities where to find him if i needed something etc i called him later that night after i realized i had accidentally left without a key and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return it felt less like paid lodging and more like staying with distant relatives our group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members so craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone one morning the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle () a local specialty the weather was nice so we spent plenty of time on his newly renovated screened-in porch listening to music while we sipped coffee and rubbed coriander's belly
1,may be the nicest most relaxing b&b my wife and i have ever stayed in  we have stayed there about three times when we make an annual pilgrimage to madison for a gardening conference at olbrichit's in a farm house lovingly converted to a b&b  the owners are lovely friendly people and excellent cooks too  one morning we were the only couple at breakfast and the food was fabuloustheir dog was present while we had breakfast; that makes it seem more like home  i wish that the llamas would come over to the fence so i could pet themcheck out their web site at speckledheninncom
1,place is fantastic the owners are friendly and personable but not overbearing happy their golden doodle dog is the sweetest and most welcoming "greeter" on the planet yet - again - not overbearing guests receive a lovely multi-course gourmet breakfast and the ownerchef cheerfully accomodated my request for a gluten-free vegan meal the grounds are lovely  there are lambs and llamas (no joke)  one has use of a mini kitchen and a nice little guest hangout area in addition to one's nice homey room we had a jacuzzi in our room we had no qualms or problems during our stay at all - this is the comfiest b&b ever
1,husband surprised me with a little getaway for my birthday and a wonderful stay at the speckled hen inn b&b we have some experience with b&bs and this one is very nice the innkeepers are friendly kind and like others have said not overbearing it's located on a small farm that has sheep llamas (or they may have been alpacas) chickens a very cute dog named happy and some outdoor cats the farm house where the guests stay is tastefully decorated there is a nice living area and a library area where you can lounge about there is also a mini kitchen you can use if needed with snacks our room was a very good size and it was neat and clean we had a tv and dvd player with movies to choose from i also noticed how nice and quite it was 4 of the 5 rooms were filled while we were there and yet it was always very quiet in our room the breakfast was wonderful the owners are very good cooks and served us 2-3 courses for breakfast some of the food we ate like the eggs and some fruits were straight from the farm free wifi was another convenient bonus if you're looking for a romantic getaway i would highly recommend staying at the speckled hen inn
1,place is amazing  the owners are very welcoming and when you eat breakfast it is like you are sitting in your parent's dinning room  the room we stayed in was beautiful  it had a huge showersteam room mini bar great tv with satellite fire place and a bed that swallows you  there are other features to this b&b other than the place itself  as mentioned there is the most amazing dog ever here properly named "happy"  there are also a handful of amazing cats on the property that will gladly accompany you for a stroll on the property  it's nice to hear that the b&b is also pretty sustainable  all the food they make is pretty much from their farmgarden (fresh eggs veggies) and anything that can not be grown on their property is from close by  we have stayed at a handful of b&bs but this one takes the cake  i would recommend the speckled hen inn b&b to anyone  i couldn't even wait to leave our room to post this review
1,should have left this review back in november when i stayed here with my parents - every time i look through our vacation photos i think about how much fun i had showing them madison and how we enjoyed where we stayed just as much  pat and bob and happy (their dog) were wonderful and their food was amazing  they make many of the ingredients on their property (fresh maple syrup anyone)  would go back in a heartbeat
1,far the best b & b i have stayed in (i have stayed in about 5 in my life thus far) huge breakfasts that were yummy and a lovely relaxing atmosphere my co-traveler and i honestly decided to stay in the inn rather than go into madison on a saturday night because it was that cozy we are not 80 but in our late 20searly 30syou can hear the highway when you sit outside but it's kind of like the sound of strong winds it's hard to believe that the property is that close to downtown madison yet it's a farm although i like to try out different b & b's just for different experiences i would strongly consider staying there again for a weekend getaway
1,business partner and i stayed at the speckled hen by chance while on business in madison  all hotels were booked and we were lucky enough to get a room here  i can't say enough about this b&b  we were overly impressed with the inn the inn keepers our rooms and the breakfasts omg awesome ;)   i felt at home here my room was extremely comfy and cozy and quiet  breakfast is served in your time and is one of my favorite parts of the stay  every morning its something new and exciting and delicious  the inn keepers and warm and friendly and the conversation was never dull  i will stay here whenever i'm in madison  the price and the service go way beyond the cost of any hotel i've stayed in  this place is a real find  there are also hiking trails farm animals and an abundantly beautiful property  if that isn't enough a good deal of what is served for breakfast is grown on the property    to say it in one word awesome
1,was our first b&b expierence and it was amazing we stayed here june 2012 for a birthday weekend the owners made us feel very special and right at home our room the madison lakes room was huge and the bathroom was spectacular i loved the steam shower the property is large and a great place to take a walk during the day they are also lots of outdoor seating areas to sit and enjoy the scenery or read a book the breakfast was great i think we had 3 courses a day of food pat makes a great breakfast and bob provides good company during the meal their dog happy is also a companion while you eat or walk the property they do also have snacks in the lounge area for you to enjoy at anytime there are sodas in the fridge and sometimes fresh baked cookies
1,comfortable quite homey elegant and friendly are words that come to mind when thinking of our stay at the speckled hen  my wife and i came here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed with any aspect   upon arrival we were met by the inn keeper pat who gave us a warm welcome and brief tour of the gust areas and our room   the guest area or as they call it the "gathering room" is very warm & inviting   here you can sit to meet with others read a book select a wine or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee tea or soda with some light snacks available as well   the freshly baked cookies are awesome    there is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out   our room the "madison lakes" was outstanding  large and outfitted extremely well you will not be disappointed  there is a king sized bed a gas fireplace nice sized tv with good cable channels or use of a dvd (you can borrow dvd's from the gathering room) free wifi a small fridge sink and two comfortable chairs to melt into   the bathroom is ginormous with a large whirlpool tub a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head all of it being very nice   the grounds of the inn is really a small farm with fruits veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast    around the far there are several trails to use winding you past the barn sheep a lama and various beds for wild flowers herbs and vegetables   as my wife and i walked the grounds and headed back to the inn we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look  inside there are a few comfortable chairs wine cooler  a dvd player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used   we sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town  however this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing the woods birds singing farm animals grazing about all made for an extremely wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from   so we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine    ahhh a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come   after a sound sleep and outstanding shower we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well  the breakfast freshly made by the inn keepers pat & bob is made up of several courses; fruit scones beacon and eggs all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the speckled hen inn b&b  the attention given by the inn keepers pat & bob is perfect  they have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the inn & grounds really well  they are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing   they really do have it well balanced   obviously my wife & i will be checking back in here again  so if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind (which is only a short drive from the capitol square) or in need of some quite time then this is the place for you   thanks speckled hen for such a relaxing time and creating some wonderful memories
1,place was wonderful all around i would return and i would recommend it is a bit higher price point but it is such a great space it is worth it if you are looking to get away relax have a romantic weekend enjoy nature this is a great place if you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive (unless you can afford it) the first floor of the house is very clean and neat but has a very comfortable and cozy feel there is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee tea cold drinks and lite snacks if we stayed longer i could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine playing a game or reading there is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out our room was very nice king sized bed robes our own deck with a great view of the sheep the bathroom had a big jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower we enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land he had dinner downtown madison which was an easy drive to and from when we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests breakfast was delicious farm fresh eggs from their hen's herbs from the garden and all the other ingredients were local we had good conversation with the other couple staying there as well as the ownersgreat place
1,adorable surprise of an inn in the middle of absolutely nowhere  i was doing a long-distance bike ride through az and booked a room here only bc florence seemed like a good stopping point before a full-day ride to tucson  from the moment i rode up to the entrance of the courtyard i was astounded  the courtyard has a tranquil appeal complete with a water fountain to soothe what ails you  the room i was in (dolores) was delightfully decorated and outfitted w the comfiest queen sized bed tv fridge hairdryer french soaps and shampoo and vintage bedside reads  and in the morning there was breakfast during which linda the owner offered me extra food to pack for my ride to tucson  what a treat to have found this place  this would be the perfect place to take a quiet long weekend escape from the hustle of life and read write breathe and just be still  i intend to come back soon
1,is our home away from home if you ever come near this area you will not regret staying at the rancho sonora it is a nice place to get together with a family and can accommodate a large group of peoplewe love staying at their casita a self standing house everything is super clean and tastefully decorated we stayed twice at casita-ilsa the ilsa has a full kitchen with a eat-inn counter tv room a comfortable bed and large bath tubthere are also affordable motel rooms which are very charmingthey also have jacuzzi and pool my father in-law stays at rv park for winter he loves the communityi love going there to see him thanks to the comfortable and welcoming environment they provide there
1,most relaxing bed and breakfast in southern arizona  linda the owner is wonderful  she really goes out of her way to make sure you have a comfortable stay  and her dogs are charming too  you get so much more than what you pay for  the breakfast is technically a continental breakfast but it really leaves you satisfied - yogurt toast fruit juice coffee cereal oatmeal all kinds of good stuff  the beds are comfortable and the rooms are spotless  my favorite feature is the pool area - a two person hammock spa with a little waterfall and a grill that guests can use for bbqs  lovely place to get away for a night or twoand really feel like you took a vacation
1,stayed here for a wedding a couple years ago we rented out the whole place and it was awesome i would definitely recommend it
1,morning glory inn is tucked into a cozy neighborhood in the south side or historic district of pittsburgh the owners dave and nancy go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyablenancy cooks an amazing breakfast every morning--pomegranite blueberry juice fresh brewed coffee with belgium waffles and fresh fruit the first morning the second morning i awoke to fresh squeezed orange juice and lemon souflee pancakeswhether you are traveling to pittsburgh for pleasure or business i would highly recommend this b&b
1,never actually stayed here myself but i spent a day there for my friend's wedding and reception  i thought that the place was perfect for the fairytale wedding my friend had always wanted  including a balcony full of flower girls dropping rose petals on the bride and groom  the entire wedding and most of the reception took place outside in the very private very lush courtyard  i would have never believed that a place so beautiful could exist just behind the busy south side bar scene  tucked away like a golden jewel for safekeeping  the owners were pleasant and completely accommodating  my friends had booked the entire hotel so we got to go in to all of the rooms i loved the feel of the place and would love to go back there again soon  maybe even get married there someday who knows
1,chuck we just wanted to say "thank you" again for all you did to make our "kids" mike and stephanies wedding so lovely and enjoyable the setting was just out of this world and the pampering was great i would recommend the morning glory to anyone who would want an intimate outdoor weddingthanks again
1,at this fine establishment will certainly be a unique and delightful experience for just about anyone  my entire family loved it and that's no small statement  the building itself is absolutely gorgeous with everything from a grand spiraling staircase to stately chandeliers  the decor is funky with an occasional leopard print rug and stuffed animal sprinkled throughout the fine victorian furniture  you'll have the opportunity to enjoy a lovely little courtyard with a cute little fountain  the service is the best part  there's always delicious food available particularly homemade chocolate chip cookies and karl and jeff the owners are incredibly thoughtful accommodating and flexible
1,at the inn a few years ago during the holidays and just rebooked for this holiday  karl & jeff are awesome and extremely accommodating street parking is always ample  they let us bring our little dog which was huge for us  i prefer to support independent business rather than supply the (paris) hilton empire  if your looking for a no-frills low key place to stay this is it
1,husband and i were in pittsburgh for the nhl winter classic on new year's day we spent three nights here and loved it we had the mr boggs room which faces the street and over looks the park across the street (in the picture the 3 windows on the second floor are mr boggs room) the room was spacious clean and comfortable the entire inn was beautifully decorated for christmas karl and jeff are wonderful hosts we had made dinner reservations at a local restaurant but upon arrival at the inn were told that jeff prepared a special new year's eve dinner for the guests he is a wonderful chefdinner was delicious the next morning he prepared a special new year's day breakfast of quiche and potatoes in addition to the cold every day breakfast items the normally serve the restaurant is only open for private dinners i suggest taking bottled water winebeer sodas & snacks with you as there is nothing "right there" to get those types of things free parking on the street and easy walk to downtown and heinz field highly recommend
1,wife and i were at the inn on mexican war streets recently for one night karl upgraded us and we loved the inn our room and the breakfast after checking in we went for a self-guided walking tour of the historic district - the people out seemed very friendlykarl was very nice answered all kinds of questions was  of great help with our getting to our dinner reservation (stay off the freeways) the breakfast area was really fun - all self-serve my wife made herself some waffles - great foodthe inn is located across from a park which we also explored street parking was fine no problems our room (the back big room) was very nice the high bed was large and amusing no complaints whatsoever highly recommend karl's labor of love (didn't meet his partner) karl sounds like a real urban pioneer of older pittsburgh and he was a teacher (i think teachers make great bnb owners) - if we are ever in pittsburgh again we will look forward to another stay at the inn on mexican war streets - thanks

1,husband and i stayed at the inn on the mexican war streets during our vacation this past week and we absolutely loved it the inn itself is gorgeous inside and out and karl is a fabulous and gracious host our room which included a private bath and sitting area was beautiful clean and very comfortable the free wi-fi came in handy and was easily accessible from our room (the emma room)breakfast though self serve was good there is a waffle maker and a toaster for english muffins or bagels fruit pastries cereal and yogurt were also available along with hard-boiled eggsstreet parking was never a problem and we felt very safe while staying at the inn we would highly recommend it for anyone visiting the pittsburgh area
1,husband and i got married at the inn on the mexican war streets in 2007  it was everything i could have dreamed of  we rented 4 rooms total for ourselves plus friends and family  the owners went above and beyond to make sure our day was amazing  the rooms were all beautiful the bar had delicious cocktails and our dinner was mind-blowing  there aren't enough words to describe how perfect our day was  thank you so much karl and jeff
1,wife and i stayed at the inn in june and had a fantastic time  the inn is beautifully restored and the stay is like traveling back in time to a more graceful era  our host jeff was extremely gracious and accommodating  his chocolate chip cookies were made from scratch and delicious  looking at previous reviews i accessed the internet and had no trouble  that said if you need the internet that bad this bed and breakfast would be wasted on you  the location is great  we walked to the national aviary and the river walk and enjoyed the beautiful park across the street
1,stayed at the inn on mexican war streets for one night in late may 2014 i stayed in mr bogg's room and felt a bit like a wealthy tycoon in the large grand roomthe inn has a very grand appearance on the outside which continues on the inside while not in pristine condition the inside is certainly not shabby and is clean my bed was very comfortable i met only one of the two innkeepers (sorry i don't recall his name) but he was very nice and helpful i wouldn't say the neighborhood is packed with restaurants and bars but there are several (good ones) within a three to four block walk there's also a nice park immediate across the street from the innif i need to return to pittsburgh i'll certainly stay at the inn on mexican war streets again (you should too)
1,recently spent a few nights here and it is amazing  i felt like we were staying in a museumcastle  karl was available to answer any questions and he was very helpful regarding the area and places to go to eat etc  the historic district is very beautiful and we enjoyed walking around  everything was within walking distance including the aviary the children's museum the mattress factory (an art gallery) randyland etc   there is also a beautiful park right across the road  parking was always available and we felt safe throughout the whole city  we even squeezed in a bit of geocaching  we highly recommend staying here
1,accommodations we were expecting a nice place but this was above and beyond great breakfast in the morning with grits that would feel at home on a five star menu highly recommend the duke for a wedding or at least your picturesone word of warning if you're staying in the harris or the van every rooms there is a conferencemeeting space across the hall we stayed during the week and a group of loud businessmen discussing their golf game woke us up at 7:30am if you need to sleep in consider the 3rd floor
1,i could give this place 10 stars i would  so for now just imagine i'm giving it all 5 starts times two :-)there is not enough that i can say about the duke mansion  anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life look no further  the duke mansion will transport you back in time to when life was a bit slower and finerthe rooms at this place are exquisite  this place is one of rare vintage indeed  the first thing i noticed about our room was that the ceilings were well over 15 feet high  you just don't fined places like that anymore  and the entire mansion is both bright and spotless  very well keptthe grounds are astonishingly well kept  you can spend an hour walking around the grounds just adoring the flowers exotic local birds and landscapingit's obvious that a lot of people get married at the duke mansion and that's no surprise  highly recommend you check this place out if you're getting married in nc or would be willing to travel to nc to get married just to do something different for a changethe breakfast was spot on  basic southern food delicious to the core  the staff are super friendly  typical of the south though :-)another great facet about the duke mansion is it's proximity to downtown charlotte and other lively nearby suburban neighborhoods  it's rare to find a place that seems so isolated (in a good way) but yet offers 15 minute access in any direction to whatever you want to dotip: get either room 204 or 205  these rooms share the lovely screened in private balcony  the balcony overlooks the fountain it's so peaceful  and it's massive  there are both swings and lounge chairsi will definitely be going back to the duke mansion  this place is heavenly  do it
1,hidden gem in charlotte  my husband and i spent our wedding night there - the breakfast the next morning was outstanding  i would highly recommend this for a romantic evening or wedding night
1,night out  i don't know if christopher titus set the ticket price or the club did but at $25 a ticket we will be going back often  great line up of top name acts coming to town  extremely nice staff highly recommend
1,great place to hear local comedy acts as well as some traveling more well known people  enjoy the great drinks while being entertained you can't beat it  thursday night there is a $1 covercan't beat that great for that night when you just want to do something different  5 stars
1,not to love about the comedy club  i have been going to this venue for about 5 years now (in their old and new location) and there's only been a few times where i was disappointed  the new location has a nice huge seating area where you and a group of friends can pay an incredibly small fee to see a great show of standup comedyspecifically on thursdays it's $1 with a student id and fri-sun it's $10  each of these tickets requires a 2 drink minimum but you can buy soda if you need to save on cash  this is a great price and there's usually 2 or 3 comics at a minimum with some shows having as many as 6 or 7  usually the whole experience takes about an hour and a half to two hours and you're almost guaranteed to have a riot  if you look in some of the local papers they print a coupon every week for a buy one get one free as well and this place definitely rings true with the saying "the more the merrier"  my only recommendation here is to call ahead as the place can get packed and sometimes they need a reservation depending on the size of your partyi've been to a few other stand up comedy venues in various major cities and also improv comedy (like comedy sportz) but this place stands out because they consistently get funny comics and an excited crowd  the humor is usually intelligent (at least the headliner) or they throw enough comics at  you that one or two of them is bound to hit your funnybone  i can't stress enough how good this place is and if you haven't been you should go next weekend  i've had my share of memories there from laughing so hard i had to get up and go to the bathroom (on my first date with my girlfriend of 5 years now) to laughing so hard it hurt because a comic rebuked insulting with a tirade that prompted a rude patron to leave  the atmosphere of people is primarily college and young adults but there are middle-aged folks as well and a lot of parents taking their college kids out on the town  the comedy almost never gets so raunchy that it's offensive and most comics either have a good skit series off the bat or adapt to the crowd  many of them have been on comedy central and several have won comedy awards  the one thing you shouldn't expect is a giant auditorium with people on the status level of jerry seinfeld but if you just want to go have a good time laugh your heart out and have a few drinks this is the place
1,place is a gem i'm now living in boston and we've struggled to find a good place to go for comedy we've visited nyc and tried a few there and everything fails to meet our expectations after going to college in madisoncomedy club on state is by-far the best stand-up comedy club i've ever gone to comedians are excellent it's in a great space with very comfortable seating big drink selection with excellent service the waitresses come by the perfect amount of times and somehow manage to not interrupt your enjoyment of the showi've only attended for their main stage shows so i don't have any feedback on the other acts they host during the week we'll be going to comedy club on state every time we visit madison my favorite show was one year when we went to a women's night with all female comedians that was very fun and different for the first time there was some humor that i got that my boyfriend didn't rather than the other way around :)
1,this comedy club- not a fan of their 2 drink minimum but glad there isn't a $$ minimum per table it's is always packed when we gojust a testament that they have performers that are funny as f*%& ;) even the "opening acts" have all been awesome
1,comedians at a good price drinks are a little pricy but beer is average priced always a fun
1,really had a great time great service great host and great headlinerdecember 13th i thinkthe only short-coming was the feature (lead in for headliner) that was from florida  he kept complaining how frickin' cold it was outside --- after the second time - the crowd seemed to collectively say 'yeah we get it - we're from wi and we know it is coldmove on buddy'things seemed flat for him after thatgreat service good crowd excellent drink menu (variety) and great hostnice place - thanks for the laughs
1,favorite place in madison i've been there many times and it's always a blast i've never been disappointed i most recently saw ben kronberg and the show was amazing as always great staff  great comedians and great drinks
1,was my first time to a comedy club and i had a blast because i do not have anything to compare it to i feel i should give the comedy spot 5 stars based on my experience last night great staff and a fun intimate setting for a comedy show here's the deal: 1 you think "hmm i haven't laughed  or smiled in a awhile lets go to the comedy spot" 2 go to the website and print out the coupon online for $2 off admission (i know what you're thinkingand yes i am a poor mofo but just do itwhy not) 3 get there a bit before your showtime since it is 'first come first serve' seating and come with a group so you an enjoy a booth unless you are down with sitting up front where the 2 top tables are (these were the people that totally got made fun of by one of the comics) 4 sit your ass downyou waitress should get there shortly so order your drink and enjoy the show
1,always wanted to go to this place and finally made it happen this weekend last night i gathered my ladies and we went to the 8pm showing the main comedian was a guy named ron morey - who i have never heard of but i'm not too comedian savvy and prefer anything other than douche bag dane cook-esque comedy such a tool (he's lame and steals jokes from ck louis btw)we arrived about twenty minutes early which was good because they don't accept cards at the door which sorta sucked since i thought it was 2009 but whatever we walked to the nearest atm giggling and stumbling slightly due to the martinis (we consumed at pearl previously) flowing through our veins we went in and just as i expected it was a very intimate place very cute although it was a little warm we grabbed awesome seats and ordered beverages there is a two drink minimum but the mix drinks are fairly priced at $5 - non alcoholic drinks are $3 not bad the show started a few minutes late but i was immediately pleased there were three "opening" acts which were funny but man the main comedian ron morey was hilarious almost peed myself a couple timesmy girls and i left there still smiling and quoting some memorable jokes i had such a great time that this will be a monthly event with my friends and iperfect for a date too there were a lot of couples there and it was just awesome watching them get awkward and uncomfortable after a sex or date joke overall awesome-obviously the crowd was cool a mix of 20-somethings to granny panties i highly recommend this place
1,here four times now saw the stagebenders for two of the four shows i've been to here great show love this place it's nice and small so there is a lot of interaction never mean-spirited on the comic's part always tastefully funny definitely make sure you get there on time they are strict when it comes to the doors closing when the show starts but it is a live performance; they do the same thing for the ballet at symphony hall out of courtesy to the performers
1,husband went here last night and had a great time the mix of comics was quite fun and the host was very entertaining as i read before that it is as cold as a meat locker i didn't have that experience my only very small complaint was that the barstools we were sitting in were very very uncomfortable so i turned it to the side and leaned against the wall it was a great change of pace adn a great price
1,ya i'm a fan  hottie and i decided to try out the comedy spot on friday  we love going to the improv but try to avoid tempe as much as possible entry is half the price of the improv so i expecting the comics to be half as funny i was wrong we were sat in the front row so of course we got picked on but i don't think i've laughed that hard in a really long time  it was a blast   a couple things to keep in mind: 1  the place is really small so buy your tickets in advance or get there a little early 2 food is limited to a couple of "stadium" style appetizers so eat first  3 two drink minimum but the prices were pretty reasonable i think our tab with tip came to $27  4 enjoy the comics and don't be afraid to laugh at yourself
1,really like this place it is very intimate with very few seats for each show so there is not a bad seat in the house  not all the acts are the greatest but it is a great value and it's even great when comics are not doing well (because you are still laughing at them)  the drinks are a little pricy but if not for that i am not even sure how they would make money  i think for that it is a very fair value for live entertainment and very great date night place to check out every month or two  i live so far so it is an evening out for us when we make it out here but well worth the drive  i saw a quentin d (cant remember his last name) but they show was so awesome and he was so funny i nearly pissed myself  the shows before him were not as good but they weren't bad either  it also seemed like the show lasted 2 hours in total  i have to say that this place pretty much rocks and since it is in old town you can go bar hopping right afterward
1,have had the opportunity to go to the comedy spot on several occasions and have always had a great time  the comedians are usually funny but entertaining at a minimum and it's a great venue  the room itself is pretty small but creates an atmosphere conducive to laughing  the prices are really good and like every other comedy club in the world it's a two drink minimumoverall i have never had a bad time there and i am totally going back asap
1,service is amazing i always have a blast when i go there the comedy is always relevant and the local flavor and intimate atmosphere makes it a first class experience if your looking for a great time at an excellent price this is the place for you
1,to the the comedy spot last night with the wife and had an amazing time you can't beat the entrance provide and two drink minimum plus they have now added a small but very reasonable menu from the restaurant next door we had one drunk girl heckling the comedians last night and they handled it perfectly just ripping into her and making the rest of the crowd bust out laughing at her expense great place to have an awesome time
1,a fun evening  much less expensive than the other clubs in town too  comics were funny
1,tempe comedy club which has been featured on nbc's "last comic standing" twice draws some of the biggest comedy headliners from around the us jerry seinfeld david spade jay mohr and kathy griffin have all taken the stage at this hot comedy room former "saturday night live" comedian sold out all of his performances at the club last weekend and the improv recently debuted the cabaret an intimate 95-person showroom attached to the club the room will serve as a stage for up-and-coming comedians local comedians and one-man shows todd glass from the second season of  "last comic standing" sold out the room a few weeks ago
1,is a world class comedy club  every time i go here i end up smashed and laughing my ass off  2 drink minimum of course but that is expectedthey bring in the creme de la creme of comedy in here  i saw joe rogan and was rolling on the floor almost  the food is pretty deez but this is a comedy club and anyone with half a brain would hook up dinner before the show  drinks aren't too pricey and actually cheap in respects to being sold in a venue  check out their website and roll in one night when a performer you dig is there you won't be disappointed
1,i love this place it's the perfect place to go for a night out the comedians are amazing- i can't say that i've seen a bad one in the dozens of times i've been and who doesn't love to laugh the food is a touch overpriced for tempe but it's nice to sit and chat for awhile with an appetizer before the comedians come on stage my favorite place to sit for a date2 person party: in the back of the showroom at the high-top tables then you can  have some private conversation - at the tables on the floor they seat in 4s so if you go with a date you will end up sitting with 2 other people- can be good for conversation but that depends on the people you're next to
1,breuer jim breuer  holy crap i'm glad our table was near the exit to the bathroom because i nearly pissed my pants twice from laughter  anyway onto the place itselfthis is one of the best comedy clubs i have ever been in  tables were crowded as you could expect but still a great view from anywhere on the floor  there's no pillars in the way or other obstructions  we were near the back of the first floor which was still close enough to easily see jim's facial expressions  there is a two item minimum per person which can be food or drinks  no one ate any food (we saw the 10pm show) but the drinks came out quickly and beers were ice cold  this place is also easy to get to and there is a sushi restaurant with $5 sake bombs for happy hour and i'm not just talking about half a beer and a shot of sake  these $5 drinks consist of a large japanese beer and a half pitcher of sake  you can probably make 3-4 bombs out of this  i can't remember the name of the place but it's right downstairs from the club in the same strip mall
1,i draw a blank for date night it seems the improv always ends up working out love that they have a dinner menushow and a late night option i love optionsi think the best part of the show is how accessible the comedians are the second or third time i went i saw tom wilson (who played biff in back to the future) and he was great and signed my trilogy set  we got to chat before the show and bought his stand-up cd another time we saw jamie kennedy (who is much funnier than you'd think) and were able to see him after the show as welli love the improv
1,am starting to conclude that this might just be my most favorite place in the world right now so if i ever am missing and you are wondering where to find me try this place first i have been to the improv so many times and have never really been let down almost all the comedians i have seen are extremely talented and hilarious let me see if i can name all the ones i have seen: greg berehnt (hes just not that into you) michael winslow (guy from police acadamy movies) gabriel iglesius al madrigal flip orly (hypnotist) michael mcdonald (mad tv not the singer) jamie kennedy johnny sanchez (mad tv) and bob marley (no not the dead reggae singer) i would have to say the only one that didn't make me laugh as hard was michael winslow there were some slow parts during his show the rest were terrific though my favorite is probably a tie between al madrigal and johnny sanchez yes the no names seem to be the funnier ones may its cause you go in not expecting much and they turn out to be awesome anyways if you love to laugh and have a good time this is the place for you besides the entertainment the food and drink is also decent the hubby and i are a fan of their buffalo wings zucchini chips nachos and cookie dessert and of course what goes better together than comedy and booze their electric lemonade is very tasty along with the simple oldie but goodie pineapple juice and malibukeep in mind when ordering tickets that besides the 20 or so $ for the tickets you will also have to buy 2 items per person which is usually another $40-$50 for a night of fun and laughs not a cheap outing but a really good one for birthdays anniversaries etcoh and a final tip if its just you and one other person going the high top tables in the back are the best to try to request one otherwise you will be sat with complete strangers at some tiny table and are literally arm and arm most of the timeits up to you but either way you get the same amount of puny table space when you think about it oh and make sure you order your tickets online as they do sell out most of the time
1,my lova' on a date here and we had such a good time  i was impressed and the whole experience was way different from what i anticipated i bought our tickets online we got there early and were able to wait in a lounge they have open before the main show there is a drink minimum so if you are looking for a cheap date night then i suggest you look elsewhere we loved the atmosphere had good seats service was great also for the place being packed you can order food as well (fruit and cheese platter was awesome)so glad we came here and i will from now on be checking frequently to see who is performing awesome place if you're looking for a little change  from the normal night out and yes seats are close together but if you don't like people then why are you going to watch one make jokes
1,club is what you make it i've read horrible reviews about the tempe improv but our experience is always great yeah the servers aren't at your beck & call but they're super busygotta be patient i suggest to having a few drinks before you go so your not so uptight:)
1,doesn't like a good laugh always a great time at the improv now we only go when we know the headliner so we really can't rate the amateur nights anyways had a great night here a couple weeks ago we decided to take my parents who are comedy fanatics like myself and we had an amazing time first of all it was so easy ordering our tickets online btw since we go there frequently we got an email giving us the tickets for free always a nice bonusmake sure you arrive early so you can get a seat up close always fun when you have comedians who like to involve the crowd we got there early enough to be close but just outside the comedians reach we usually don't get food but we ordered some and were pleasantly surprised at how good it was another huge bonus for this place since most comedy clubs we have gone too the food is usually sub par pub gruball three of the comedians were awesome the emcee was very weak but the comedians did a great job getting people back to that happy place i have the improv bookmarked on my phone and computer to keep an eye on the calender of events we will be back soon and often thanks improv for providing a little laughter in the hot arizona summers
1,have a blast at the improv  its an event whenever you go and watch a show
1,show is a huge diamond in the rough on the strip in a relatively crappy casino  we got super cheap tics for $28 at tix4tonight  the theatre is pretty intimate although the seating arrangement could have been better since the tables and chairs were way too close to each other  luckily there was plenty of space to stretch out as it really wasn't that crowded  we laughed pretty hard throughout the hour show  it's been a long time since i've seen the chicago show but many of the actors had previously worked in chicago so the quality of the comedy was very high  there was quite a bit of interaction w the crowd as well which is something i really love about improv  this is simply a wonderful and unique show in the midst of everything being bigger than life in vegas
1,comes to mind when somebody mentions "whose line is it anyway" laughter right even side splitting comedy unique scenarios and improvisation well jesterz is no different located in the papago plaza at the corner of mcdowell and scottsdale road the spot called theater 168 due to the location is tucked into a retail plaza blink and you might miss it yet once inside don't let the decor (or lack thereof) fool you this isn't about props and paint swatches this is about comedy performed on the fly with audience participation come prepared to laugh so hard you almost choke on your gum like i did come prepared to participate to voice suggestions topic ideas emotionswatch a cohesive team of jesterz weave together comedy - right before your eyes it's suitable for all ages and is an absolutely perfect date idea or go with friends and family bottom line: just go you'll leave feeling cheerful and energized and if you're like me you'll be talking about the jokes the comedy the laughter the fun for days and days so much so that you'll want to go backbasic info:the jester'z perform every friday and saturday night at 8:00 & 10pm at theater 168 tickets are $12 for the 8pm show and $10 for the 10pm there is no age restriction and never a drink minimum (concessions available at the snack bar)
1,loved this it was different it was cheap and it was good clean comedy my favorite kind
1,is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests  it never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt  always fresh always funny  great place for a date night or family night  even my teenagers love it  i never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly  to finish off the night head down the street to "the sugar bowl" for fresh ice cream
1,lol just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that i have seen at jesterz the first time i saw jesterz i was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect i was blown away how funny it got at times good clean funny we went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times even with a smaller crowd there were tons of lol moments writing about it kinda makes me want to go back
1,of "whose line is it anyway" will like jesterz improv  the cast is smart funny and welcoming  it's a treat to see how five very different personality styles combine on stage to assemble stories from audience suggestions  we took friends on our first visit and had a great time  you'll definitely have something to talk about after the show  i appreciate that the ground-rules keep things from veering into the gutter thereby encouraging creativity  that doesn't mean it's the best fit for young kids though  the sweet spot for this "all ages" show is probably teens to adults
1,laughed my ass of the whole time its a family oriented place soo thier always friendly with thier language and there jokes such and amazing improv there truly gifted you can aswell do speial requests at no extra charge at the prices are worth the laugh you will have a stomach aching i will deff recomend yall going one thing is that you have to make reservations for the day they aslo do events  make the call and have fun to end the night  as u get home u will still be laughing come back and review
1,is one of my favorite places to go in the valley always a blast :)
1,was such a fun eveningfamily friendly so take your kids take your girlfriend on a date etc etc  the owner jeff is always there always entertaining and i was leave with a smile on my face  it takes so much talent to do an improv show and this is by far the best i've seen  can't wait to go againcheck in on yelp or facebook and get a free item from there snack bar
1,improv scene in the valley is something i really love so much that i even got into taking classes and eventually became part of the jester'z improv troupe in scottsdalei went back to jester'z to check out my pal who had a class show he's only in the first level class but i was so impressed with how well everyone did and am excited to see the growth at their final class show they're definitely on the way to becoming great performers and may even make it into the regular troupejester'z has shows every friday and saturday night at 8 pm and 10 pm tickets are $12 and that gets you a 1 12 hour show where audience members give suggestions that the troupe takes and turns into short comedic scenesjester'z is extremely consistent with its shows providing a steady stream of laughter on any given night many of the improvisers are also actors in other media such as film and television and the troupe is extremely professionalhaving been a part of it i know how hard the actors work and how seriously they take the troupe and i highly recommend jester'z as a fun night out for more info log on to wwwjesterzimprovcom
1, i'm still laughing if you want an evening of family fun you have to check this place out  they are hilarious  i have been 3 times now and each time i leave with my sides hurting  the best part is that they are clean comedy  i think it takes a lot more talent to make people laugh without resorting to dirty jokes they are improv which means even if they play the same games you're going to get a completely different show every time  you're going to have fun  trust me  plus there's really no such thing as a "bad" seat here  even in the back row you're close enough to the stage to be in on the games  but if you can sit right in the front i recommend it because some of the facial expressions from the actors are priceless especially in those rare instances that one of their team members catches them off-guard be sure to add them on facebook  every now and then they'll have last minute specials plus their shows frequently sell-out and facebook is often the quickest way to get that info so you don't have to try going to a sold-out showhighly recommended especially if you need a laugh
1,favorite vegas strip comedy club  the comics are always funny and the price is right compared to the improv at harrah's la has a more modern look than the outdated riviera
1,of the most fun night we have had here in vegas went for a friends birthday and ended up only costing us $28 fr me and hubby to drink and get in (thank you facebook) hubby had gottten the all you can drink  and let me tell you he sure did $20 all you can drink well drinks he was a happy camper we had great seats and the comedian was hilarious i love how he interacted with the audience  i will definitley go back and maybe get a room this time so i dont have to be dd :d
1,la comedy club is now located in planet hollywood at the cabo wabo second floor being they used to be at this same location when it was trader vics i was confused but it is true went to saturday night show 2 comics and a mc they were very good the club is on the second floor and has a real great view of the fountains and the strip it is a good venue much nicer than the canyon club
1,great stand-up show every timei've been going to la comedy club for years now and have never been to a bad show  sure sometimes some of the comics aren't as funny as i would like but the headliner or one of the other two have always made me laugh  the new venue is at bally's and is past the jubilee showroom up the escalators beside the poker room  the seats (which a lot of people complained about before when it was at ph) are better than before but still normal padded chairs  the view isn't as good as it was at ph but it is a better showroom overall and is medium sized yet intimate  they do a lot of specials as well from groupon to locals deals and their last minute normal pricing is fair as well  on top of all that they have an all-u-can-drink special that is usually $25 but can be less if bought with packages  so the price for an 15+ hour show on the strip is a+ awesomei've met a lot of the comics after the show (not required but i like talking to them) as well as the awesome maitre d (justin) and even the owner who is often there making sure everyone is having funbottom line:  i really enjoy using the la comedy club shows as my default date nightnight out or just something fun to do all the time so check it out if you like comedy
1,club was great  there were 5 comics that were all at different levels of funny i was expecting only three   i really liked the headliner and would go see him again  he was smart and didn't rely on just shocking the audience with a bunch of crap
1,highly recommend buying tickets to see the stand up comedians at la comedy club my friends and i were laughing until tears were rolling down our faces the price for the tickets are reasonable and our show was 15hours divided between 4 comedians we will defiantly attend during our next visit to vegas
1,loved this show it was my first time experiencing an "intimate" comedy show at the palace station venue we waited forever to get our tickets but louie held off from starting until everyone was squeezed in i can't believe he is still so talented after all of these years the best part is that you can tell he loved doing the show and that he loved his audience
1,i have attended louie's show in the past and loved it the review below is based on my experience when i attended marty allen's birthday show  this review originally appeared on vegas posh the online magazine that my husband and i maintainmarty allen is what classic comedy is all about: he's funny without being offensive charming has spotless timing and an arsenal of facial expressions that keep audiences laughing just as much as his jokes do  when allen celebrated his 90th birthday with an engagement at the louie anderson theater at palace station he proved to las vegas audiences that at 90 he's just as funny as he's ever beenallen's wife karon kate blackwell started off the show by showcasing her vocal talent the kind that you only find from entertainers who had to rely on their own talent and not on high-tech studio equipment  allen appeared before a cheering crowd opening with a hilarious monologue before doing his first skit the wine taster from caesar's palace an alcoholic whose wife is so ugly that "her pictures hang themselves"throughout allen's skits blackwell played the straight lady but even the straight lady couldn't help but laugh at many of his jokes  the chemistry was undeniable and the two had trouble keeping straight faces throughout many of the skits including the one that featured allen as a doctor who had just written the book everything you've always wanted to know about sex* *but were afraid to ask your childrenbetween skits blackwell sings dances and plays piano  her performances included a high-energy rendition of "proud mary" and a deeply moving beatles medleyperhaps one of allen's funniest jokes was the story of an eight year old boy who goes to the store to purchase a box of tampax  when the clerk asks if he knows what they're for he responds "not really but they're for my four year old brother; we saw the commercials and they said if he bought these he would be able to swim and ride a bike and he can't do either"  commenting on modern times allen delivered another hilarious line when he joked "you know times have changed when a man goes to the drug store and says (loudly) 'i'll take a box of condoms" (whispering with his mouth covered) " and a pack of cigarettes"although allen's routines are classics and many of his characters originated decades ago he keeps his act fresh and modern appealing as much to audiences today as to audiences of the past without succumbing to the trend of getting cheap laughs through vulgarity  audiences were undoubtedly left looking forward to allen's 91st birthday celebration
1,love louie anderson and i've been really looking forward to seeing him live this was not a disappointment the venue is nicely intimate so you really feel like you're getting a good live show not just watching something on tv i've been following his standup for years and i've read most of his books so i feel like i already know all the people he's joking about like his parents and siblings louie definitely tailors his show for the specific audience so you'll likely get a different show every time you see him one of the biggest laughs he got was when he was lamenting that we can't just change the constitution and vote bill clinton back in the whole audience appreciated that onei loved that he really took time to chat with people who stood in line to buy books t-shirts andor dvds and signed everything it really makes a difference from a lot of comedians who won't even emerge from the green room except to perform then sneak out the backlouie was excellent and if you already like his humour this show will be a great experienceps -  drink service was attentive and the opener was great too which is also a rarity
1,ya louie   great guy great show 
1,anderson live is by far the best comedy show we've seen during our trip  he is a true comedian that anyone can enjoy  all ages can relate to his true life humor the theater was perfect in size to make the show intimate and personal  we purchased general admission tickets and sat directly in front of the stage  the wait staff was excellent in making sure we had what we needed my husband and i are still laughing and would recommend this show to anyone
1,girlfriend and i went on 122714 and louie's show was amazing he hasn't lost his touch his opener lou magelowitz is always funny and has a solid jokes i've gone to multiple comedy shows and this show hands down tops them louie even took time to meet everyone take pictures and sign stuff after his show he is still all about the fans i will definitely come see him perform again thank you lou and louie for helping make our year end with on a high note
1,had never heard of this guy gordie brown before but we wanted to see a comedy show while we were in vegas and it was very reasonably priced at the tix4tonight booth so what the heck  this was a great show i laughed a lot and it was definitely worth seeing
1,first saw gordie brown at celine dion's concert in san jose my boyfriens and i just loved him he was so funny charismatic & his voice is great as wellwe book eda trip to vegas end of may to celebrate my b-day and took 2 friends with us to the showthe were laughing so hard we laughed though the whole showthis guys is going to be big :-)
1,impressionist great singer & really funny guy  gordie brownfor what he does he is pretty damn good  i got the chance to see him at the golden nugget last night and laughed from the beginning until the end  he has a whole band and they perform hit songs that he makes fun of ( kinda weird al'ish)  he impressionates everyone from eminem to jimmy stewart so all age ranges can appreciate himhis performance isn't just music he also impersonates hollywood actors pretty goodothers have given him bad ratings but i would like to say he is not a hack in anyway  he is 90 minutes of straight comedy  the only thing i would say negative was we were in the second row and the music was a tad bit loud so just be prepared for that  if you like him as much as i did at the end give him  the band a standing ovation and you'll get an extra performance
1,had a long day at work and my head was pounding  when i got home my wife tells me that my aunt got us free vip tickets to see gordie brown at the golden nugget  honestly i was tired stressed i had a headache and i didn't want to go  good thing that my "fabuloso wife" convinced me otherwise  the gordie brown show is located in the golden nugget - upstairs  going up the escalators it is a bit of a maze  once you are in the auditorium it  is pretty small and cozy and yes very comfortable  our seats were in the center 4 rows from the stage  fantastic seatshow would i best describe it  hmm he is a very eclectic and an entertaining performer  in a way he reminds me of a weird al yankovic (for those who lived through the 80s)  he takes old and memorable "catchy" songs and rewrites them with his own lyrics  in addition it is pretty amazing how he has "most" of his wardrobe changes on the stage  it is pretty funny and extremely entertainingoverall the music lyrics jokes and everything was fantastic  after the show i felt more relaxed and my headache was gone  a true test of a show is whether you would return and pay to see the show again  my answer is yes i give this a five star because it was great and it was free  lolenjoy
1,sister and i were were at gordie's show this last tuesday night  (march 22 2011) and he was "terrific" as usual  that's why we've been driving in from california once a month (for the last 3 12 years)--just to see gordie's show  we first saw him on october 302007 at the venetian and have been going to his shows ever since  we'll be there again on thursday april 14th in our usual row c  thank you gordie for being such a talented performer  we'll continue to see your show once a month as long as we're ablesue n
1,talented  impressions singing acting being a nice person those are insanely harder then i think people give credit for  and gordie to me is worth every penny  when i think of gordie i think of appreciation  he does a little bit of everything and most of the stuff he does is pretty spot on  we as show goers turn into critics without ever separating the fact that we have little to no knowledge on most things we crititize  in this case it doesn't matter what you know or don't know he's amazing  i appreciate he's studying he's detail his effort his appreciation  he is worth the time and money
1,performance for the moneyat first i was a little nervousshow started 5 mins late started out ruff but he sings dances tells jokes and does some very funny impersonations the show kept building until the end and kept my add busy for a bitwell worth ittip: sit within the first 3 rows near center or u will miss the face expressions which are hilarious
1,show in vegas very entertaining funny & talented love going to see gordie
1,brown you rocks   i never laugh that hard in my life and i am asian i am not supposed to get everythinng that he said but yeah i did and it was damn hilarious it was such a great show my fiancee were crying from laughter when he sang wake me up when september ends i know its gonna get awesome lol his timing his voice his song selection and his entertainment value are off the chart how much do i pay for this guy i got free tickets but i would absolutely pay $100 to see him perform absolutely must see and absolute rockstar comedian and non stop 90 minutes of total one man show ohh great band toomust see gordie 
1,freakin' funny i'm a fan now  i literally laughed so hard whew i needed those laughs  gordie has such a cute charmcan't wait to go back :)
1,think that i can safely say that there were few things that my father and i agreed onrita rudner happens to be one of them  she is hilarious and her show is just terrific  she had me in stitches from start to end  my husband likes his humor a little "raunchier" but rr is right up my alley  she manages to be whitty and smart without being crass or swearing or the like  she is just a class act  impeccable timingfunny stories about her english husband and her dog just makes it al the more personal and funny  i love her wardrobe  she is just the best best best
1,loved it  rita did a great show and we couldn't have laughed more  i had a interesting party with me my 11 year old step daughter who has never watched a comedy show and my mother in law that lost her husband less than a month earlier  i was so happy to see both of them laugh so hard and for my mother in law it was the best seeing her smile and laugh again  rita was charming and came across like the kind of gal you'd love to have over to the house and we didn't have to worry about the foul language and inappropriate material for my step daughter - with the exception of the one time "a-hole" which had us all in stitches  very relatable material - we loved it
1,quote another blog "i ate a lot of red meat this week" i have to blame (in a good way) tom friday's for the switch in my diet  the meats offered at this small neighborhood market are fresh and quality the price is affordable  for example this week my fiance and i dined on an amazing seasoned brisket for less then $500 each the seasoning was perfect the cooking instructions they provided when i asked worked without a single hitch and the beef was tender and juicy even when well-done (which is how i like my meat cooked)they advertise their fresh italian sausage (hot and sweet) - which is stocked new each friday  also worth while is their ground beef (we easily go through a couple of lbs of ground beef a week between the two of us)  a slab of ribs will cook up tasty and tender on the grill without needing to boil or marinade for hours i have yet to try many of their other offerings - but i am sure i will at some pointalso check out the hot dog and hamburger buns - they are fresh and deliciousthe service is also friendly and helpful  if i could adjust anything it would be the hours - they close at 5:00 each day and are not open on sundays  thus you have to make that effort to get their on saturdays if you are not right near by in the neighborhood
1,can't believe this place only has one review  but i can believe that the one review is a 5 star rating  i also believe that tom friday's defines the term "meat shop"  i've never been disappointed  excellent meats good quality at reasonable prices and great customer service  i've had several of their offerings including the pre-made hoagies (yummy) and homemade kielbasa (perfectly seasoned)  their ground meat makes the most delectible burgers  the huge cuts of steak i've had were always the freshest  and i'm always a fan of the popular butter steaks  basically my review is this: if you like good meat support your local meat shop and stop by tom friday's market  you'll be glad you treated yourself
1,is a gem in pittsburgh  the owner tom and the workers will remember your name  its just like being in a small town  fresh meat and friendly people  the meat is the best i have found in the city and is affordable too  the best steaks i have ever eaten have been purchased from there and cooked in my own kitchen  they are also very knowledgeable  they can answer any question you have about what cut of meat to choose or how to cook something  they're also more than happy to share tried and true recipes which have always worked out for me
1,can i say that everyone in the area doesn't already know  i've been going there over 30 yearsthe staff are always friendlytheir deli meats and cheeses are good quality and well below chain store pricesand the specials are always a fabulous value  i have never been in the store when its not busy busy busythat just shows how much people love this store
1,go to butcher shop  high quality fresh meat at fair prices friendly service convenient for us but worth the drive for others  support your local meat shop
1,the day  we had custom ordered a ham from another place and they totally ignored the order  we had to return the sad excuse for a ham and began the search  found this place and saw the 5 stars  made a call and was transferred to the meat section  bernie took 3 seconds to tell me she had what i wanted and to come on inwhen i got there i saw why it had 5 stars  their meat section was amazing  if i lived here i would take them up on their freezer meat offers  what a dealas i was checking out there was a final thing that made me know we had come to the right place  the local fire crew was coming in to grab their meats  nuff saideat well
1,for the vikings  sure they might have looted and pillaged their way across europe and spawned plenty of bad death metal bands but in the grand scheme of things that's pretty minor why because without a little genetic mutation spawned in scandinavia that allows adults to continue consuming dairy all their lives i'd have to avoid the amazing cheese section that penn mac has and would be stuck eating some funky soy based cheese or *gasp* having to do without and that would be a sad day indeedwith enough cheeses to make wallace & gromit happy you are bound to find what you are looking at penn mac   and if you don't know what you are looking for the cheesemongers are great in helping you find your wheyif that was all penn mac had it would still be a required shopping destination but they have so much more  their deli is just as amazing with the best prosciutto di parma you can buy  and if you can't find the olive oil or other italian ingredients you need here then the only place you are going to find them is back in italy
1,need you in los angeles boo hoo wah sob appreciate this place pittsburghers it rocksthe cheese is of amazing quality and freshness what fucking varietyand there are a million other tasty things under this roof you can't find a place like this easily trust me i have tried
1,the hook amazing selection of cheesego here
1,agree this is a wonderful place to buy cheese  anywhere else in pittsburgh (and i do mean tj's and whole foods as well as giant eagle) your cheese is likely to taste like the plastic it is wrapped in  at penn mac it's not only the best in town it's beyond excellent  in price freshness quality selection  you can buy half pounds despite what the sign says  i always did  i also think the nuts are a great deal  and the spices  worth the trek from whatever neighborhood you live in or from your downtown workplace  if you have a car they do have (limited) parking in back  and some of the nicest flowers in pittsburgh are sold out front too  holiday seasons and weekends this place is a bit nuts but i went regularly year-round maybe every 2 weeks and totally relied on this placefoodies visiting pittsburgh especially if you're staying in the convention center area should definitely check out "the strip" for shopping and snacks
1,mac deserves more than 5 starsthis place is the best italian food store i've seen anywhere in the us  the selection and quality of their cheeses meats olives pastas oils sauces etc is just incredible  the prices are also really good - any other store with a big cheese selection will charge a ton morei used to shop here at least once a week and since i've moved away from pittsburgh this is the store i miss the most  i now live in chicago and even here there is nothing like it  i still frequently buy their stuff online through their websitethank god for the internetfavorite items include: calabrese olives house italian olive oil istara cheese mortadella wpistaccio ciabatta bread
1,much to oggle so much to buy i think i'm in love i had too much fun at this place great selections of cheese meat pasta etc makes me want to buy and play they also had the biggest bottles of olive oil i'd ever seen so you know you can buy just that exact quantity of oil that you need i must go back
1,and dudettes this place is amazing they've got cheese pepperoni and prosciutto coming out their ears fresh pasta homemade pasta sauce and olive oil from the barrel for the taking they've got frozen dough pepperoni slices and shredded cheese all next together if you want to bake your own pizzas when they're not busy go to the deli and find the perfect compliment to whatever wine you've been needing an excuse to drink the people that work there are the nicest folk that clearly love their jobs most of them love that i don't know the first thing about anything italian because it gives them a chance to share what it is they specialize in goods are cheap fresh and of the highest quality i hope i'm able to find something similar when i move soon one of the top 10 reasons i've enjoyed my time in pittsburgh
1,darling you talkin' to your boyfriend"  the deli counter man recently teased me as i waited in line talking on my cell phone  oh the deli men - they're hilarious  i'd even say their worth the trip out to the store but you might want to know more about the food glorious food i shop at the macaroni company weekly  they're great  from the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait to the great selection of bulk foods to fine selection of meats to the italian cheeses to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and jupiter this place is lovely  (or loverly if your eliza dolittle)  the place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends and i think many people are tourists but that doesn't stop it from being great and that was a long sentence but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors i've readin any case the macaroni company is a little slice of italy mixed with pittsburgherness and fun
1,will never buy any type of italian sausage at giant eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like  and the deli counter guy at giant eagle doesn't inappropriately and amusingly call me "babe" every five seconds like the ones at penn mac do   ordering "hot italian sausage" from a deli guy that calls you "babe" is as amusing as sunday morning can get   :-)    i'll keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as i live in pittsburgh
1,walked into penn macaroni co knowing i knew absolutely nothing about cured meats and cheeses  i've always been intimidated by specialty shops bc there are always giant lines with people who look impatient and want to just grab what they need and head out  i decided to swallow up my fear and head inside with the intention of walking out knowing more than when i walked ini headed to the cured meats section in the deli room and kinda just stood back staring at all the beautiful meats  when one of the deli guys was free and asked me if i needed help i flat out told him "i know nothing about anything in this room  but i want to learn"  and he was like "i got just what you need" and brought out some samples for me  he went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff  after i picked out my meat i was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like "i'm not done with you yet" and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out  he also told me i have to feed my friend more bc she looked too skinny pi love going into a store where i get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job  it just makes you walk out with a smile on your facei plan on heading back every other week to get a new pairing of meats and cheeses and hopefully one day my palate will be super sophisticated haha
1,crap this place is amazing  best meat selection in madison tons of brats awesome service tooweekly he has a 10 for $10 burger special which is amazing and our first time we only bought 2 burgers (yummy pizza ones) and he gave us 2 buns  today we got jalapenocheddar burgers brat patties and chipotle burgers plus 4 hawaiian brats (they have pineapple in them) all of that was $16we also put an order in for an upcoming special they are having--12 sirloins for $20 and 10 lbs of jalapenocheddar brats for $399lbi am so glad that my man and i found this gem if you love both traditional cuts and innovative hybrids check out jimsps jim is a super nice guy too who loves his business and does it well
1,local meat market nice selection incredibly friendly staff & great deals
1,selection of meat and sausage i dropped in on a lark and they had unlimited skirt steak which i couldn't find anywhere else in madison (totally weird coming from chicago)  great quality skirt required a bit of additional trimming but that's normalwill visit jim again and again
1,love these guys they always have great recommendations and good quality food they are my go-to meat market even now that i live outside of madison they are super friendly too and helped me carry stuff out to my car when i was with my baby great store
1,neighborhood meat market everyday prices are competitive; weekly specials are spectacular--beats supermarket prices for much better quality meat best item: the sheboygan brats these are absolutely the best brats i've ever had whether in wisconsin or in germany other varieties are very good toothe staff moreover is both friendly and knowledgeable they can do practically any custom order they get to know their customers and treat regulars like family
1,this place and the people that run it they're just an old school neighborhood meat market  burgundy steaks are the best great deals always
1,completely rocks john (part owner & tall friendly guy behind the counter) will take time to talk with you about your wants & needs and will special order anything you wish i say this because he did it for me many times over the years that i lived walking distance from the store their fresh amish turkeys are the best you can get for thanksgiving you do need to order those in advance however if you don't see what you're looking for in the display case just ask he would custom cut a chunk of center sirloin for me - he always had a primal in stock not frozen he would let me hang out in the lobby and talk meat on saturday mornings between customers i wanted to help out behind the counter just to learn from the team but they hire young people to work the counter and i couldn't take a job as a hobby that someone else needed to get thru school etc long story short - if you likelove meat but can't tell a ribeye from a strip this is the place to go they will help you make a decision and how to treat the meat if need be remember - the only stupid question is the one that never gets asked you needn't worry that you will be looked down upon if you ask a novice grilling question this is not a pretentious boutique it's a friendly helpful business that truly values your business and they will help you make some killer meat
1,you love steak you'll love ken's  i take that back  if you love meat period you'll love ken's  they have the best steaks ever and the chicken breasts are huge  their brats are really good as are the rubbed pork grillersthey have a variety of other picnic staples like potato salads and macaroni salads and some produce  then add to all that they have a convenience store attached so you can buy some pop or beer or whatevermy personal favorites are the burgandy pepper steaks  it just doesn't get any better
1,been there once and been wanting go back again soon we used to go to that side of town once a month and i would wonder about this place with my husband's name so one day stopped there to see if they have anything quick to eat fresh sandwiches were greatmade the way we wanted the place was clean and very friendly too badfound it after i no longer live on that side of town
1,pepper steak get one of these and you will understand why 5 stars isn't nearly enough so good
1,is great we rarely have ever got bad meat here - and we've been to ken's at least once a week for almost 15 years virtually all the steaks are great people really like the burgundy pepper steaks the rib eyes and ny strips are my favorites the sheboygan brats are fabulous the ribs are great too - nice and meaty when my family does burgers we always get their sirloin burgers really tastythe staff is often younger people - but they are very nice and well trained the only downside would be is that it's pretty expensive - especially the non-meat products i only get the non-meat things if i really need something and want to save a trip to the regular grocery store (but this is typical of mini-mart type places)beware - on nice days they will go through some things early don't wait until the last minute they do let you call and make orders which is nice if you want to guarantee something will be ina wonderful place highly recommend
1,best meat market in madison it has great gresh chicken brests get the burgundy marinaded steak check it out
1,moved into our monona neighborhood over a year ago and ever since that day ken's has been a mealtimeneighborhood staple  it's so easy to pop in and grab something delicious to throw on the grill  they also offer a decent assortment of deli salads pickled veggies pies wine and other need-to-haves so you don't have to waste time running to large grocery stores for last-minute items  new to ken's  try one of their delicious pinwheels or my favorite--burgundy and black pepper steak
1,stop here for the meats and fresh made sandwiches it is a convenience store with a very nice meat case there are reviews on here complaining that they don't have an actual butcher shop there are not that many around anymore so deal with it or butcher your own burgundy pepper steaks are marvelous i tried to marinate my own but have not been able to match these reasonable prices
1,single thing is delicious here i go here for my monthly freshly made deli sandwich for lunch i almost always get the honey ham and swiss on a croissant with green leaf lettuce fresh red thinly sliced tomatoes and perfect mayo their pre-made salads and sandwiches are creative and fresh too great breads fresh cheeses oh and babcock hall ice cream
1,first went looking for a good butcher shop after getting sick of the poor quality meat found in grocery stores every piece of meat i've had here has been delicious they also have fish and some interesting game meats though i haven't tried eitheryou can also get some lunch food here if you are lucky enough to go by when they are smoking some meat in their outdoor pig-shaped grill the smell is intoxicating their deli selection is small but i find they have everything i need the people here are very friendly and you'll notice the same people working most of the time it has a very nice local feel that beats going to a grocery chain hands down
1,old time meat and deli shoppe is one of the only places in champaign that i have no reservations about giving 5 stars  it is spotlessly clean inside and full of tip top meats  the staff have always been nice and helpful when i've been there and i'm pretty sure it's the only place in cu that has rack of lamb
1,did it take us so long to discover old time it is amazing i will never buy meat or fish at the supermarket again i particularly like the knowledgeable staff the smell of bbq and the extensive range of high quality products they sell the best beef i have seen outside of texas and new zealand
1,don't even know where to start with old time meat and deli because i have too many good things to say about it absolutely delicious cuts of all sorts of meat checkemployees who are helpful and actually know everything about their products checkthe best yeast rolls i have ever found anywhere checkfresh bones for my dogs to chomp on checkand the list goes onthis is the only place in all of central illinois i will buy meat from they get their meats and rolls (not deli meat) from local amish communities and it is obvious that they take great pride in all that they sell  every cut of meat i have had from here whether it be ground chuck a pork chop spiral ham or rib-roast has been absolutely amazing and their bacon is to die for the best bacon i have ever had i'm drooling just thinking about it yumif you think you've been buying great cuts of meat from a grocery store in the c-u area i will tell you you haven't and that it's time you visit old time and see what a quality piece of meat tastes like you will never be disappointed
1,place is so awesome  very fresh cuts of meat great customer service knowledgeable employees what more can you ask for  they are always willing to go the extra mile here  on one occasion i bought meat for a stir fry and the employee offered to cut up the meat for me without me even having to ask  another time i was looking for salmon fillets and the fish had just gotten there and one of the employees cut me a fillet  i highly recommend this place
1,am thrilled to death that this place exists  they have a wide variety of meat and cheese products most (all) of which is produced locally  furthermore said meat and cheese products are *delicious*  frankly i think for what you're getting their prices are very fair  i went in and bought a package of thick-cut bacon (which was heavenly by the way) a very large cut of choice filet a pound of virginia ham a half pound of provolone and some beef sticks and only emerged about $30 lighter  that's a pretty great deal
1,place is the best place to get meat in the c-u area  their staff is friendly and knowledable; it's just the kind of place you'd think would be packed in a place like champaign  not only do they have a good selection of beef and pork but you can pick up side dishes (and beef house rolls win)  they'll also cut you something special if you ask  definitely stop off on your way home via neil street and you won't be disappointed
1,is a wonderful butchershop deli selections limited to standards of ham turkey chicken with good selection of cheeses prices reasonable considering the quality
1,friendly staff  sirloin patties and the twice baked potatoes are my go-to choices here  will make a special trip for them  good stuff
1,prime cuts from here are so good both my wife and i have become too "spoiled" to enjoy several of our former favorite steakhouses - preferring to stay home and cook these ourselvesthe staff are extremely knowledgeable and are willing to help with advice getting a fresh cut trimming to order or anything else that might conceivably make you happier with them as a butcheri can not recommend this shop enough
1,the sandwiches are really good and the meat is top quality it's also nice grabbing an exotic item from the shelf for dessert
1,me some stanley's  i've been going to stanley's for years and years and thank goodness some things never change  i don't have any friends who have eaten stanley's subs and don't love them (if they didn't i'd probably end the friendship)i love the ladies behind the counter who spent plenty of time in the old-country love the meat hanging everywhere love the imported grocery items - even love the smalleverything (parking lot building tables etc)quality meat means great sandwiches  we swear that they put an addictive chemical on it that makes you crave it fortnightlyeven if you know of stanley's for their sandwiches - do yourself a favor sometime and order a plate of pierogies (they'll even heat them up for you if you ask)  they're dynamite
1,yum  when i got married many many years ago stanley's catered food for my reception  there were sausages stuffed cabbage sauerkraut pierogies  omg  my hungarian grandmother would have been very pleased  i just wish she could have been there  anyway just wanted to say that everyone raved about the food and we had lots of leftovers ordered extra on purpose  since grandma was no longer with us she did all the amazing cooking of these wonderful foods we savored each and every bite
1,is so much goodness in this place i don't even know where to begin i've been going here ever since i was a little girl a few times a month my mom or grandma would stop in and get the smoked butt perogi's polish sausage blood sausage bratwurst  hot italian sausage liverwurst bacon or whatever was recommended to us at the time by the ladies behind the counter  i have to admit as a child i was pretty unnerved by the ladies behind the counter but after 25+ years of going here they are very sweet and wonderful ladies many times i have asked for suggestions and the have always came through for me on my last trip i told them i am having a bbq this weekend and what smoked sausage would go best as a snack  their question "are you serving beer" and yes i was the next question "you like spicy" and yes i do  she went over to the side wall and pulled two giant red links off the rack and said with a smile "thiswill be good" (when i got home i tried a little and it was good)i can see where people can say the ladies behind the counter are intimidating but they really are wonderful  i have stopped in for a sandwich a time or two in the afternoon and had great conversations with them when i was the only one in the store and it was slow  they have even offered me a tour oncethis is a place ran by hard working immigrants that have an amazing product every time i am in the area a make a point of stopping in and getting the smoked butt (the "butt" is actually the shoulder cut on a pig bot the actual butt) its excellent sliced thin on a sandwichyou don't find sausage shops like this anymore  my grandma grew up in wisconsin and she said this place reminded her of the polish deli's she went to back in the 50's  authentic and yummy
1,thing i saw another reviewer hate aobut this place i love which is you walk in the door and it feels like you have entered into eastern europe the backwall is lined with all sorts of smoked pork products from chunks of smoked bacon to ham to what seems like a never ending display of different types of sausages and yes the women providing the service are not all that smiley but come on you get an authentic experience with people you know their smoked meats and boy are those goodi picked up a chunk of smoked bacan that they slice for you and the smoked pork butt is just wow i went home and chopped some up and sauteed it with some sliced fennel bulb and lentils and it was like wow so good both smoky and salty i also picked up some sort of dried sausage stick and though it is bad for you it is so good - a great addition to a nice glass of red wine some cheese and some good french breadby the way if you live in tempe and go to the farmer's market on saturday morning it is on your way home just take 7th street to mcdowell and take a right and it is right around 21st street and mcdowellso when you go in the store and the eastern european women don't smile at you just remember you walk in that store and you are in their culture not yours so enjoy the experience and buy some sausage :-)
1,skool european at it's best    sausages hanging behind the counter to dry and age and the smell of the place made me want to lick the walls the ladies behind the counter are a testimonial to how authentic stanley's homemade sausage is completely the real deal there are many european grocery items avalable to purchase as well the sandwiches are yummy and fresh on bread that seams as if it just came out of the oven (even though i don't think they bake anything there) the meat is what it's all about  reminds me of parma the polish area in cleveland and the polish american festivals    without the crowds
1,love love love their meat they must sprinkle it with crack or something cus those sandwiches are addicting lol
1,seems a waste of time to review this place  if you're not already a fan my 5 star isn't going to change your mindbut wow  our two friends said the best brats (8) they ever ate  and our smoked sausage sandwichs (18 & 20) were fabuloussorry guys the lady who took our order (on a saturday noon) was reasonably happy and the gal delivering from the kitchen was very smiley and friendly  must have been our irish charm  so next time you go don't pretend to be polish tell 'em you're irish
1,great feels very old-world when you walk  the lady behind the counter was so calm and unruffled as the place steadily filled up while my mother placed her order for a month's worth of meat  asked her to recommend a sausage to go with cheesecrackers -krakaw is a about the size of my thumb and so flavorful and rich tasting - yummy   i chose the polish sausage and hungarian sausage to take home for master griller to have his way with them - will have to update my review after the big eventthey offer homemade sandwiches there too - we got something loaded with a variety of lunchmeats on this soft almost "roll" bread  reasonably priced and so fresh n tasty  however when i made a smart crack about "what kind of knucklehead would order the vegetarian sub that was on the menu" i couldn't even get a little snicker out of the counter lady she is old school & old world  i love it  go there check out the website first so you know what you might want to order counter lady don't play and she don't mark those items all wrapped up in white paper so pay attention and do it when you get home support your local businesses or you will be left in a corporate clone world
1,your wallet or if you have little self control it maybe better to just bring some cash and leave the plastic and pay check at home the smell of the meats curing on the racks when you walk in to the front deli will transport you to meat valhalla this is what a deli is supposed to be all their meats here are delicious if the lady behind the counter is mean to you you probably deserve it if your a first timer just order the european sub all they're cold cut
1,sausage-maker in central phoenix try a few of these instead of what you get at trader joe's (which are also good) and you'll never go back you can get anything here from from andouille to chicken cranberry the staff are helpful welcoming and thorough
1,simpson: wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute lisa honey are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again what about baconlisa simpson: nohomer simpson: hamlisa simpson: nohomer simpson: pork chopslisa simpson: dad those all come from the same animalhomer simpson: [chuckles] yeah right lisa a wonderful magical animalthe pig is indeed a wonderful magical animal and schreiner's fine sausage is a wonderful magical place that offers the full range of porcine productsthis is a pork-lover's paradise  my favorite is the homemade slab bacon because it doesn't taste as salty as bacon you can buy elsewhere  they will also slice the bacon to your desired thickness  what could be better  i like my bacon sliced nice and thick (setting number 6) so that the pieces cook up lovely and crisp  i top my homemade curried deviled eggs with pieces of schreiner's crispy bacon  you can also buy the slab bacon if you have a recipe that calls for you to make your own lardonsschreiner's offers over 60 varieties of homemade sausages  they feature everything from bratwurst italian and polish sausages to the hard-to-find items such as: andouille and tasso (cajun); linguisa (portuguese); bangers (english); chorico (spanish); chorizo (mexican); and cheese sausagethey also have homemade lunch meats hickory-smoked hams and moredon't overlook their wall of pickles and pantry items  the frisch-gurken baby pickles that the bf and i picked up here are the cutest addition to a relish traythe pig is a wonderful magical animal and schreiner's fine sausage is a wonderful magical place
1,my goodness  my husband and i have driven by here many many times but never thought it was open  finally at the local first festival we were treated to samples of their oh-so-fine sausage  you can taste the freshness in the incredible product that they put out  we decided to finally stop by because we were making homemade pizza for our annual christmas eve tradition and this time my husband and i were in charge and we wanted to make it special  we came in to buy italian sausage and pepperoni but we were hard pressed not to leave with more  they sliced the pepperoni nice and thin exactly the way we wanted it and gave us a big giant string of weiners which i found hysterical  we opened the wrapped up pepperoni in the car and we had a really difficult time restraining ourselves from eating the whole thingbottom line if you want the freshest most delicious locally made sausages and other stuff like that you have to go to schreiners
1,stopped in for lunch and walked out with 2 pounds of lovely charcuterie products their shelves are stacked full of various sausages smoked pork chops head cheese and more their $5 brown bag lunch was a steal as well your choice of one of 6 different sausages served hot on a bun with your choice of toppings all that with a soda and bag of chips very nice i purchased a pound of smoked bratwurst and a pound of bockwurst the smoked brats were very tasty with a light smoke flavor reminiscent of the hillshire farms smoked kielbasa my mom used to buy the bockwurst let me tell you were delicious a creamy mixture of pork herbs and spices all encased in natural hog casings when i closed my eyes i could imagine my childhood growing up in germany they were that damn good i will definitely be back and will definitely walk out with a few more pounds of sausage
1,cannot believe that i haven't reviewed this place yet it's incredible really an incredible amount of pork products from all natural casing hot dogs to different wursts to the most amazing sausages and tons of products like capicolla head cheese bolognait's all goodthis past weekend i picked up the hot italians sweet italians apple jalapeno cheddar dogs beer hots and their cajun boudinsobviously i love my pork (urge to make sausage innuendo jokes rising) all of the sausages were amazing juicy tender with crisp skins the hot italians were actually spicy which is amazing most "hot" italians aren't the jalapeno cheddar dog was gooey and spicy and the beer hots were spicy with just a hint of lager to themi've had the cajun boudins but i haven't been able to get into my new ones but to be honest they're amazing mixing pork and rice in a sausage is an awesome ideain their store they have samples the head cheese is glorious despite the name of "head cheese" trust me it's incrediblevery cheap prices and friendly staff (even though i would honestly expect a huge italian guy yet i am greeted by two awesome women) help round it out and keeps schreiner's at the absolute top of my list
1,i've been here like a kazillion times but never thought about posting a review for it this place is sausage heaven (crack all the jokes you want haha)  i moved back to cen pho about a year and a half ago and had always wanted to check this place out but never did i was instantly hooked and have been a loyal customer ever since  they have tons of different types of sausages and dogs most come smoked or fresh i'm a huge fan of their smoked linguisa and their' chorico they also have these odds and ends mixed sausage-brat-hotdog skewers for like 2 bucks a poundand i'm a real sucker for those the prices are awesome you can get out under $20 with a great mix of sausages and brats for the grill make this your go-to spot for grilling this summer and trust me you won't be disappointed
1,can't beat shriner's meat after a visit to short leash dogs (they serve shriner's meats) i had to go to the source i am of german decent and grew up with some dang good weenies they have to be in a natural casing with a great flavor and snap we got two pounds and they are marvelous just pick them up and dip in some good mustard and you are set we also bought some traditional brats these were the best i have ever had the flavor was outstanding last but not least we got some of the bacon they will slice it to your preferred thickness and boy is it good the prices here are fair especially considering the quality you receive go get some (wieners that is) :)
1,like your meat long smoked and spicy they got that short and thick  with an au naturel casing they got that too thin floppy and tasting of meatloaf hey whatever gets your rocks off the snausages here are crazy amazing and they have just about any pork related product your little heart can dream up ground to an appetizing taste and texture with just the right amount of spice the prices are also more than fair compared to other meat markets around town word to the wise schreiner's is a small mom and pop and they only take cash check (crazy right) or debit cards no credit will be extended to your broke ass and if you want to use your debit card you have to gather up at least ten bucks worth of meat in your hot little paws before they'll run the card don't worry it's more than easy to do the people that work here are very knowledgeable and if you tell them what you like and why they'll recommend all sorts of stuff they have an intimate knowledge of the meat they sling so stop on buy shoot the shit and they'll slip you some mighty fine sausage
1,repeatedly astounded at how many people in this city who claim to be in the "culinary know" have no idea what schreiner's is besides the tremendous brown bag lunch special which consists of any dog or sausage with chips and a soda for $5 schreiner's is a great place to buy loaf meat weiners and sausages many chefs in town swear by their products and it's for good reason they are some of the best around i made some home made sonoran hot dogs last night using schreiner's hot dogs and it was one of the best dogs i'd ever had
1,this place is the best place to get sausages in phoenix period the breakfast sausage could very well best the best ever i go here regularly and have had so many of thier sausages they have all been great i do not even buy supermarket sausage anymore after finding this place not even in the same ball park top notch
1,were able to get a great cut of brisket here just over 3lbs which is just what we wanted  it may look scarce when you walk in but most of the meat is kept in the back so just ask  in addition to pastrami brisket you can get corned beef brisket chicken and assorted other deli meats  they have have a grocer section where we were able to pick up challah rolls (mmmchallah french toast anyone) matzo meal for latkes and my husband's favorite pickles- ba tampte  there are also lots of other selections ranging from candy to cous cous to egg flakes and cereals  they have a pizza place next door (which may have deli offerings as well) called king solomon's but segals itself is just a pure butcher and grocer  having grown up with kosher pizza we opted to not grab a slice because to be honest kosher pizza isn't all that good
1,first time i stepped into the store i was hit by a wave of wonderful aromas that reminded me of growing up in germany the lunch meats smoked hams brats blutwurst etc are from authentic german recipes and one can even get a real schnitzel here the ladies behind the counter treat you like you would get treated in a store in germany and the store also offers a selection of foods imported from germany jams coffee breads dairy products like butter and quark cookies candy canned goods cooking and baking mixes if you have german recipes and haven't made them because you can't find the right ingredients or if you just like good food please pay this store a visit you will be pleasantly surprised but bring cash no credit cards accepted or you could go next door to the black forest mill to have your german meal prepared for you along with a german beer
1,place is a wonder  all kinds of sausages and meats  i'm a real push over for smoked meat  i especially like their lachs schinken which is smoked ham cut very thin  making soup  try it with a smoked pork haxen  another favorite is their fleisch salat  but beware the fleisch salat is put into a container without weighing so the price of each container may not be what you think it will beclose but not exactgreat place and like all german butcher shops it's closed on monday
1,can smell those brats simmering in beer & onionsahhhhhhhsimply the best
1,german sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in phoenix  our family has been enjoying their homemade ham lyoner bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years  their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh  walking through the door will immediately transport you to europe  don't miss this valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days
1,glad we found this place everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in germany walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too  this is our number one place for authentic german meat
1,german sausages that i ever had  they taste the same as those that i had when i traveled to germany  and the best thing is that they will vacuum packed them so they can last for a month and taste just as fresh as long as you don't break the package
1,was raised in germany this place is as close to "home" as it gets try everything the service is gracious bring cash if the made cake that day don't ask what it is just buy it it's going to be delicious leberwurst (liver wurst) is fantastic best i have had in the us every sausage tastes authentic and fresh you won't regret it
1,place is awesome we can't eat regular store bought brats anymore their potato salad is to die for as wellwhen you walk in you get a strong smell ofwell something awesome and smokey and realize behind the register there are smoked something or others hanging right there in front of you to the left are some grocery items as well as spietzle (sp) and some other items to the right is the deli counter that holds tons of meats and other goodies as well as their brats they have two kinds from what i have seen course ground and find ground i believe i am not sure of the difference since we usually only get the fine ground white onesthey make limited portions of everything since its all fresh so get there fast for the potato saladthis is our go to for grilling out and its always delicious
1,is a true phoenix treasure the two sisters are very helpful pleasant and business-like sometimes when they have meat just out of the smoker they will offer a sample or they'll toss in an end chub (wrapped) into your bagit seems like they know you're going to rip into one of the other packages if they don't come with cash & chose practically anythingsandwich meat sausages or the uber yummy beer-case cheese  every time in there are usually some europeans shopping there which also validates the legitimacy of this fine establishment
1,i love more than german sausage and when it's authentic i can't stop smiling - just standing in the store hearing orders in deutsch sends me over the moon today i just grabbed 2 wieners and 2 bratwurst as i patiently await my sauerkraut i've got brewing in my crock at home homemade cheese and cabbage soup with authentic fried wiener on top and i've got myself heaven have always wanted to stop in here and now i have a reason to make it a constant in my life
0,to be one of the worst place for a trade show no place to sit to eat the food is awful and you are limited to what's available to eat or drink  bathrooms get overcrowded and filthy inside like a college football game
0,have been a aaa member for over 15 years today when i really needed them they were not there for me and i'm even a premium member i will not renew my membership with them clearly premium doesn't mean squat to them and they acted like getting to me in say four hours or so is acceptable thank goodness i have some amazing friends but aaa not anymore there's way too many other companies that would probably stand behind their premium roadside service at way less than about $20000 per yearso you've lost another one aaa you don't stand behind what you advertise and i'm voting with my feet
0,dont know how to begin my utter disgust disappointment anger and being upset with aaa  this afternoon i was involved in a car accident where a stupid teenager was texting while driving and side swipe 5 cars (my car being one of them)  i have been an aaa member for almost 6 years with no traffic ticket or accident on my record  my home insurance is with aaa my other home which is a rental unit is with aaa my husbands car my friends car and house is with aaa and  on my first accident in the last 7 yrs (one which is not even a fault of my own) where were you unfortunately for me my agent was out-of-town until the 17th so i got connected to this person named carol and as i was trying to shake the nervousness of being involved in an accident this carol gave me a run down of things i needed to do and told me "when you get home call the claims department" and when i asked her why do i have to make the phone call (i was assuming you guys call because you are my agent) her response was "because you are the one involved in the accident  you didnt know that" how utterly cold and unsympathetic can you get and she ended the conversation by telling me good lucklet me break down the numbers on you peoplefor my car insurance i pay you $1500yr and so does my husbandi pay you an additional $500 for homeowners insurance plus another $500 for my rental propertyyou people make almost $4000 on me annually and this is the service you provide me i believe that after 75 months of being a costumer of aaa (a loyal one at that) it is about time to look for another companyone that is there when you need themthe lesson i get from this people isyou will never know how good the company is until you are in troublethen and only then you can say if they are good or not oh and aaa maybe you need to spend some of the $4000 you make from me annually to train decent and proper people  to work with you
0,had a horrible experience with towing i called and told them my car needed to be towed because it was dripping gasoline when the tow truck arrived the driver said he could not tow my car because it was dripping gasoline they then told me i needed to have it cleared by the fire department before they could tow it i called the fire department and they said they don't provide that service it would've been nice if aaa had told me they couldn't tow it in the first place before i wasted my day waiting for them a different towing company towed it without problem aaa towing was a waste of money for me
0,would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service not at this location they are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything this is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistancethe organization is disjointed especially depending on your project there's even a section called "art supplies" i thought that was kind of the point of the whole store what did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames the place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them but apparently michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather so the inevitable happened and i dropped the bag now i don't expect every place to be sympathetic even though it could have been packed better but when i asked for a refund they were down right rude hey i did drop the thing but some empathy would have been nice i wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place i will never be back to this or any other michael's
0,the michaels in charlotte this one is probably the one i like the least  the store always looks terrible but that is partially due to it being an older store  the other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)  i'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other michaels in the area but it definitely lacks selection  lastly our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers  for these reasons i generally go to hobby lobby or wait until i'm on the other side of charlotte to go to a different michaels
0,does this place stay in business it's never a good shopping experience here and i've never seen it busy coming here i feel as if i'm raiding the owner's personal collection you're not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you soone time i asked the owner to order something for me and he refused because he would "only make $1 off it" so i went to g-mart and they ordered it for me insteadconversations with the owner are bound to be interesting -- like the fact that he wants to have a funeral pyre when he dies -- but most people i know are made uncomfortable by going there apparently our two kinds of geek do not meshg-mart has a better selection and the employees are helpful and funny
0,was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend she was still finishing her final paper after a 2 week crash course that kicked off her graduate school education mind you i said grad school yes i am a fully grown man in his early thirties with a girlfriend who is in grad school not a 18 year old undergrad with no money i was just killing time and saw this shop i stopped in to browse as i was browsing i knelt down to get a better look at some books on the bottom shelf grabbed one to figure out what exactly it was  this takeing maybe a full 10 seconds mind you i'm kneeling (not a comfortable position that i would stay in for long) and the guy behind the counter comes tells me that your not allowed to sit on the floor and read i look at him like huh i explain i am kneeling and wasn't even reading just looking he points to a sign and says "those are the rules" rather rudely i take the 3 books i had in hand (and was planning on buying) put them back on the shelf and walk out i haven't been treated that bad in a store since i was 12 judging from the other reviews this guy isn't very friendly and his store is kinda dirty i mean really when was the last time you dusted dude your little model cars on the wall were filthy
0,have had very poor experiences dealing with this business  period
0,have been here one time and one time only i will never go back i took my two kids here since my son is into pokemon and my daughter loves my little ponies plus it's very close where we live i tried to get one of the three people working to help us but they seemed more interested in avoiding helping us my questions were answered with one word or a finger point my daughter was able to find a couple of comics but we never did find the cards my son was pointed to when we checked out the person behind the counter said is this it and rolled their eyes not the kind of experience i expected of a place geared to all ages i was disappointed to say the least
0,went into this michael's with two items to return i noticed that there was only one cashier and a line 5 people deep but luckily there was an employee behind the service desk as i stood waiting to talk with her i realized the people she was talking to were not customers but two other employees and the three of them were bitching about a customer who had wanted to make a return and how annoying she had been then one of them (nancy) noticed me standing there turns around and says to me "you're making a return you can get in the regular line" seriously did you really just suggest that your conversation is so much more critical than helping a customer that i should go wait in another line that's very interesting nancy thanks meanwhile the other two don't even look at me including the one manning the service desk what the helli walk over to the one open register and wait for about 15 minutes while this one cashier works through all the people ahead of me and i kid you not when i was one person away from freedom nancy noticed that there were 3 people behind me opened up a register and told the woman behind me to come over frankly i think all three of those employees should be fired for wasting michael's and my time while getting paid i'm sure they make crap pay but that is no excuse for flagrant laziness it has cost michael's my business
0,hate this place i don't know why i ever go in there if there were a joanns every 5 miles i would gladly go there every time i go a michaels i am sadly disappointed no matter what store i go into the employees are dull unfriendly and lazy they are always carrying on dumb conversations the lines go on forever the old lady cashiers are always rude like i'm wasting their time there's always something on the wrong shelf so when you get to the cashier she looks at you like you're lying or just stupid they have lost my business someone needs to get the district manager in these stores because they wont stay in business with that customer service
0, me thinks not is the truth  horrible with a capital horrible  about 3-4 weeks ago i took in a 20x20 poster to be framed  the guy told me it would be ready 919  notice that it's 3 days later than 919 and i have not yet received a call from them telling me my frame still isn't ready but i have also called multiple times since monday and i sit on hold for 10-20 minutes only to find out they still haven't done my frame  if you quote a date it needs to be available to be picked up that day or before in my opinion  after speaking to the manager just now he says they have "125 customers that they deal with weekly in the framing dept"  uh-huh  that's not that many customers for a big name store and if they can't get their s*** together by the day they say they will then they better back it up with a phone call or in the future recommend a later day that the item should be finished and ready for pickup  total crap two thumbs down wayyyy down
0,don't know what i am doing writing a review for this store that no one (at least no one with any ability to change anything there) will ever read  nevertheless i came i saw i left empty handed as nothing (in truth not one little thing) in my entire basket rang up as it was marked on the shelf  i don't know if it is incompetence stupidity or a laudable "i don't give a flying f" attitude that makes this the worst michaels in the area but i am not sure i have the time to devote to studying the subject matter  i think my favorite part of today's experience was when the third item rang up wrong and i told the cashier she said "oh" and looked blindly like a deer in headlights no "i'll check on that for you" no "do you still want it" just a blank stare  sadly i'll be back next week because this is the closest one when i am out and about  but seriously as soon as i find an acceptable online substitute i am outta here
0,really isn't much i like about michael's to begin with - i especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster  clean up your aisles for goodness sake i feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at k-mart but possibly worse
0,michaels is the foundation of my theory that some chains stay in business despite the reality that shoppers loathe them because there's no adequate substitute it's the only source of craft supplies that's handy while running errands in central phoenix and it's near one of the movie theaters that serves real food so i shop here occasionally and i always leave crabbyevery section is tiny and understocked if something at another michaels catches your eye but you postpone buying it and you figure oh you'll pick it up at this one because you're here no you won't wood trim wood embellishments specific acrylic paint colors specific scrapbook paper designs the edgiest floral items forget it this michaels will not carry that the staff will explain with varying levels of chagrin that "this is the smallest michaels in the region"that much is obvious it's so small that it's impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles the major reason to set foot in this store is that you're desperate for tacky glue and can't face the chaos of walmart it has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue there was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced martha stewart acrylic paints which are at least interesting colors but i'd really like to know whose bright idea it was that chain-wide acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level let me give you a hint gentlemen: the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children nor is there a gigantic acrylic-painting movement among munchkins your acrylic paint buyers are adults which means we're mostly over 5 feet tall and depending how the day went and how high of heels we're wearing our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary a lot but it's rarely a matter of: "oh great i'm going to michaels so i can skip the squats at the gym"
0,are only two people who work in this huge store today and neither know where lamp oil is or were able to call a manager because the "manager is busy in a meeting"
0,workers aren't knowledgeable of the store layout which is a mess by the way (i asked a woman where the letter stickers are for things like mailboxes and she pointed me on the opposite side of the store when i thought they'd beright where they ended up being she also lacked any confidence in her sentence when she said "yeah i think so" in reference to where they weren't)the most helpful woman there let us know that they didn't carry the fabric paint we needed which wad disappointing but at least honestthey in general don't seem to care about customer service in the front since there were 6 people talking and two of those people were cashiering the other four were ignoring the line of waiting customers while chatting with each other and the chatter was not work related either then after ten minutes of waiting in line as the next customers one cashier took people behind us while the other took someone not even waiting in line ridiculousto say the least the crafts have to sell themselves and thank goodness for the employees here that artists and people that do crafts on a regular basis find the need to buy supplies here or this place would be out of business quickly if based only on the customer service
0,customer service at this michaels is just plain horriblethe badme and my girl frequent michaels she for her crochet needs and me for my shoe paints i never really ask for help unless i am completely lost i'm usually ok with getting lost the times i have asked i have not been met with kind responses but i just let it roll off my back this last time was different me and my gf received and email coupon for 50% off for halloween promo my girl needed more yarn so we decided to both go and i would use my coupon for an extra yarn for her after we were done shopping and ready to pay i noticed everyone was using a coupon the gentleman who was working cash register seemed very nice to other customers as soon as i came up and asked him how he was his mood changed he did not answer my question and asked if that was all i said yes sir and i showed him my coupon he said oh another one i just laughed it off like ok after i finished and he was giving me my yarn in no bag i said thank you again he ignored me i snapped i said your welcome that's what u say after someone thanks you or at least acknowledge me i know i scared him as he started nervously laughing and saying sorry i just walked out shaking my head i won't go back to this michaels and i won't shop without a coupon again i did call and leave bad review on both of our receipts and i think i am going to call the manager as well real lame customer service should always be called out
0,have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around i have since began just ordering online the customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid avoid it if you can
0,the sweat panted ( hey put a little effort in to it ) crabby ( if you you think your job sucks find a different one ) ' barista' ( being able to work an espresso machine is not that much more difficult than a mr coffee) at least gave me some fodder for crappy service reviews lazy dirty and angry is no way to garner tips i didn't drink the coffee afraid she spit in it
0,staff sucks beyond rude shouldn't be in business don't know how to make drinks don't waste your time or money going to this place the nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds
0,a flea market  nothing more; nothing less  it's old crap that no one should need unless you are a hoarder  there are plenty of free flea markets and yard sales that are free  this misadventure cost me $20 in admission fees  what a waste  it's $10 a head  finally no one takes credit cards even for the admission charge  after all flea markets and yard sales typically deal in cash only  i now feel slightly dirty
0,used to be a great company to work with the products were made well and the service used to be outstanding now buyer be ware i have had nothing but headaches with my orders first was with the drapery order i placed in july my drapes still are not up because of one debacle after another first some of the hardware didn't arrive then it came in the wrong finish then the didn't include as stated drapery hooks and they are back ordered till jan 2014 then hung a pair of drapes and the other pair for another window in the same room wasn't the length stated then i called to have the right length sent oh sorry mam they have been discontinued you will have to take down the pair you just hung and order something else and by the way it is going to cost you an additional $200 dollars 45 mos later i am still dealing with their screw ups ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack a friend and i worked on this for 3 hours it should have taken no more than 30 min we could not get it together because it didn't line up sorry mam you will have to pack up this very large and heavy item and set it out to be picked up have spent a lot of $$$$ and would have had better service and products had i gone to walmart they used to be a great company i have been brought to tears and all i have gotten is a smug and condescending attitude when i complained to one of the online managers and explained my disappointment with he had no sensitivity to all i have been through and at one point even tried to point the finger back at me at one point told him i would be telling everyone i came in contact with and the internet media how horrible my experience has been his reply " do what you have to do" wow were has customer service gone
0,a huge fan of kohls and moving to the charlotte area has pushed me to find a different kohls than the one i always went to an hour away and here it goes from the many other kohls that i've stepped foot on this is the most disorganized department store i've been to the prices are higher than other kohls' for the exact same product i purchased a cardigan for $21 at the charlotte kohls while the day after i visited my hometown kohls and found the exact cardigan for $15 that was a return the selection in this kohls is so poor i asked an associate if she could help me find a pencil skirt in the middle of the summer and she said that they don't carry skirts how can they not carry skirts last week i stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed i purchased this watch for $250 at their store and when i asked the lady to change my battery she told me that she is afraid to do it because she broke her watch changing the battery are you kidding me you also have to pay for a battery change while other kohls change it for free i love kohls but everytime i've been to this store i've gotten an attitude from most of the associates and never been able to find a good deal so i've stopped going
0,received a pj set as a gift from my mom for christmas she paid $1920 for the top and $1920 for the pants which  $3840 total  unfortunately they were too big so i had to return them for store credit upon doing so i was told that the items were now on sale and that they would only refund me the sale price which was $1439 per piece plus they were deducting the $1000 kohl's bucks that she received for the purchase so my mom paid $3840 for the pj's and because they did not fit and i had to return them i was given $2005  the kohl's cash i almost get but not refunding the original price paid for the items is bull but the taking the kohl's cash promo away from the gift receiver is crap as well it's a promotion the store is doing and as it turns out it's just a big money maker   i will never shop at kohl's again and i will ask my friends to do the same especially if for a gift not a happy customer goodbye kohl's
0,incredibly pathetic  i just had the worst experience at red  then i get on yelp and realize how many others have come to the same conclusion--enough to write about it  how can a store possibly survive if you are treated so poorly  wow  i was seriously shocked--zero personality and 100% icy and rude--as if they didn't even want you in the store  so why did they open one  even if i found the perfect piece i would never buy from red modern furniture  people buy from people  it is about time the owner figured that out
0,century furniture is supposed to be warm welcoming and approachable not here almost every piece of furniture had a sign on it: "do not touch" or "do not sit" it felt more like an overpriced museum when i asked the owner about all the signs she said "i don't go to a luxury car dealership and sit in all the cars i can't afford people who buy a really nice piece of furniture here don't want something that everyone has sat their butt on" i'll never waste my time there again
0,i came on here to "rag on red" looks like a lot of people beat me to it after having a great brunch at st francis across the parking lot my boyfriend and i decided to take a peek in well first of all i wasn't sure there was anyone there for a while which was fine we just kept looking around and being goofy looking at all the cool old stuff that they have to offer as we made our way through the store i found who i could only make out as a sales man sitting in front of some lady on a computer they bothered themselves to greet us at that point never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit (i've worked my way through collegelaw school doing retail big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed)soooo i was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store whengassssspppp i tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail you would have though i had taken a hammer to it with their reaction i was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything whateveri was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas its their store if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business what blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair an egg chair you would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending he asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about  anyway i'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone i know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air
0,was so excited to check out this store living in a vintage building and flush with cash i felt it was the best prospect for furnishing my apartment however after spending a few minutes in the store i felt cold alienated and stupidfor starters i was never greeted my presence acknowledged or even asked how my day was the store was empty upon my arrival and it was not until i dared to touch an item that my presence was acknowledgedalbeit with a condescending and rude outburst by the stores owner i thought the furniture was vintage and originalapparently they refinish and refurbish furniture and pass it off as found vintage i was told by the owner that most of e furniture was recently shellackedand was not in display condition i also had the unfortunate experience of asking the staff about several pieces i was interested in between eye rolls and deep sighs i was told of the inaccuracies in my question yet never told if i could purchase the items or not after being deemed too dumb to engage in a conversation by the woman minding the store i was handed over to the stores owner with a sigh an eye roll and a rather condescending "do you want to handle this" the stores owner than continued to alienate and insult me making me feel dumb and rather small it seems as though the storefront is a showroom for their online sales as most items are not for saleand anything that is worthwhile is plastered with "do not touch" signage very unhospitable for a furniture store as i usually like to sit in something before i purchase it i'm not going to even go into the prices which seem as alienated from reality as the stores owner or his assistant; two ageing hipsters locked in a battle for who could be snootier or more pretentious aside from the nasty staff the lack of  hospitality and the god-awfull smell inside the store i would say the store was acceptable i'm sure this store will survive as most online customers probably don't know that they are getting refurbished furniture stored in a putrid cat-urine smelling environment and sold by condescending belittling better-than-thou hipsters avoid this store check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town
0,people are weird  talked to them about saving them money and they became emotionally reactive  very unprofessionali don't trust them
0,joke a place for kids to smoke even if you just want to play pool you have to deal with all of the smoke and immature people for some reason a few people think hookah is cool but for each is their own this place can really be a great place if it was serious
0,only things i have to sayover packed bowlsunfriendly people over priced poolthe worst thing of allcamera's in the bathroom i get safety reasons and stuff but that's taking it way to far disgusting and disturbing
0,to see if they had any liquid for my ecig and whoever was there was watching tv with someone on a couch and acted like i was bothering him by coming in and didn't have any knowledge about the products i was looking at i asked what they were and if he knew if any of them were good and he just shrugged and said "i dunno i don't use that stuff" i understand if you don't personally use every item in your store but you should at least be a little more knowledgable about the things you carry and maybe try and act a little more friendly in the future i don't need sunshine and rainbows but at least don't look annoyed that i just interrupted what you were doingsuffice to say i won't be returning here
0,ended up moving over to gilbert recently and saw that there was a smoke shop i dropped in because i had quit smoking and wanted a zero nicotine e cig to help me with kicking cigs when i walked in i had a guy show me the e cigs he told me the cartridge was non refillable after the first try which was really odd however i figured i would buy one anyway since i can have two cartridges well they sold me a $16 cartridge that doesn't even fit my e cig ridiculous that he blatantly lied to me never coming here again
0,i work just down the street and read the reviews so thought it would be great wrong they gyro was ok but the salad that came with it was nasty wilted lettuce with a brown slice of tomato and a blob of dressing their prices are too expensive for lunch and to top it off the girl working take out was totally snotty and rude when i asked some questions about the menu this one is a pass for me
0,the chicken tasted more like the grill than the meat itself  the "salad" was shredded lettuce with dressing no veggies  the location is great so i'm a little disappointed the food wasn't better
0,servicei was visiting from la and we hav tons of hookah places since the moment we sat down they gave us a huge attitude after seating us it took them over 10minutes to even akcnowledge us they had only 4 other tables so not busy at all and the waiter visited them several times before he even responded to me flaging him down i asked him for any hoolah he would like to bring us 10min later the hookah arrived but we had to wait another 5 mins to get charcol they put this tiny charcols which went out in a few minutes i actuallt had to get up and go to ask for more then i asked the waiter is he can give me a menu to order some food and something to drink he said ohh the kitchen is closed i said well can i atleast get a drink he said sure and got me a beer  the interesting part was that they continued serving the other tablea with food atleast 30minutes after i asked him service is the key in these kind of business i guess that is acceptable in arizona but this place would not survive one day in la poor management
0,found a dead fly in my salad coated in dressing the server didn't charge me at least but oh my goodness i will not be returning
0,dark dirty place bad service totally in-authentic food anyone who thinks this is good med food was born raised and lived in apache junction their entire  life
0,not go to this restaurant  the owner is not honorable  the owner advertises with restaurantcom  however upon presentation of the voucher he refuses to honor  before going to restaurant we confirmed the vouchers validity over the phone  a better choice is pita jungle or persian room
0,confirmed with restaurantcom that the voucher was valid and that the owner acted in an inappropriate manner  avoid pita house
0,unsatisfied the meat was so under cooked and the service was not good my food was cold and the hummus dry  it's never good when you leave a restaurant still hungry  the rice was not fresh &  i was  so thirsty because my waitress forgot about me  overall 2 thumbs down
0,walked in to order carry out and interrupted a waitress smoking her hookah  she didn't even get up right away to help me guess she needed a few more hits  service is so rude especially for this upper class area  this place is a hole in the wall  i had to wait for my food in the same area miss congeniality was sucking her hookah with her boyfriend  the food was just ok doesn't warrant another visit
0,worst service i have ever experienced they even tell you they don't serve tap water so that they can charge for bottled water they are rude and inattentive i  would never come back wish i could give less than 1 star
0,visited red sea a couple of years ago and i really liked the atmosphere and the service i'm sorry to report that things have changed and i will not be visiting red sea again i visit different hookah bars often and i must say this is one of the worst experiences i have had the bowl got over heated and instead of fixing the problem he took the coals off and told us to wait really the shisha is burned to the top of the screen waiting is not going to help i could have just smoked my hookah at home
0,disgusted by how this place made no attempt on their website or elsewhere besides a piece of paper on the door saying they are closed staying on the strip getting a taxi to this place was not cheap expecting it to be open to find it isn't service has been horrible on many occasions
0,place was horrible first of all theres no sign saying the drinks are non alcoholic the staff is rude i came in with a party of 7 and the place was empty other than two different tables yet it took them 5 mins to seat us we then ordered two hookahs one banana split and the other pumpkin pie neither of them tasted like what they were supposed to and on top of that they loaded it with so many coals so it was harsh the whole time we asked them to fix it and they just started blowing in the bottom of the tobacco holder burning at least half of the bowl of tobacco we tried it again it was still burning hot and the pumpkin pie tasted like shit we asked for a different flavor and they told us they were going to charge us for another hookah so we told them to fix it then they brought it back and it still tasted like shit floor cleaner to be exact finally they give in and get us a different flavor mind you its now been 2 hours we've been there now they never came back to add more coals and the unlv girl that works there has a bad attitude  so when we go to leave they charged us for the third hookah that replaced the pumpkin floor cleaner flavor i will never go to this place again and i hope they go out of business
0,place was empty came here twice mabe 2 groups at the most were in here ultra high prices hookahs cost 20 to 30 dollars its nuts they don't smoke that great and the guy working there was a little creepy he would pop up all over the place the prices where just outrageous there's palace in summerlin that's way cheaper and nicer i would npt recommend this place
0,has some how managed to make every hookah mistake in the book and added a few of their own as well if i could give this place negative stars i woud not hesitate i am astounded at how this place stays in business red can be found in a decrepit strip mall behind a dunkin donuts next a equally miserable discount movie theater on tropicana and pecos they used have a location up in summerlin but moved down there when they couldn't pay the billsto begin the prices and policies are outrageous each hookah will average anywhere from $20-30 maybe more this is pretty much double the price of most other lounges in town for some reason red charges additional fees to mix flavors and its not cheap every additional flavor can tack another 2 bucks to each hookah to accompany this overpriced hookah is of course overpriced drinks and what weird drinks they have lounges like this that do no aspire to obtain a beer and wine license usually sell an assorments of drinks teas smoothies and the like red however feels compelled to offer non-alcoholic beers and non-alcoholic wines (yes they exisit) after seeing their drink selection i wasn't sure if i should laugh or crynow keep in mind i don't always mind paying more if its worth it but this is definitely not the case at red the hookah is absolutely dreadful i don't think my words could describe the disaster that they bring to your table the hookahs take forever to start and when they do get going they taste like burnt tobacco if your favorite flavors are charcoal and ash this definitely the place for you the biggest culprit behind this atrocious mess is the lounge's insistence on using insta-light coals they toss these coals on to the bowl and lock it under a metal funnel designed to contain the coal if the hookah falls over on top that they actually demand an extra 5 bucks or so for a "re-light" i was left speechless when i was actually asked to pay another 5 bucks for another coalthe atmosphere and lounge itself does nothing to redeem the hookahs here either you will find crt television sets displayed proudly around the lounge i don't know why they keep the relics around the place would be actually somewhat attractive if they got rid of them and opened the place up a bit i have never seen it busy or even half-packedthere are plenty of great lounges in vegas do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this place
0,place is so horrible my friends and i waited for about 30 minutes to be seated then another 20 to get our hookah on hip hop night it seems like there are 16 year old girls dancing on the walls it's so ridiculous this place smells absolutely terrible i don't know how people out here in nevada do hookah out here but being from southern cali our hookah lounges are 1 million times better
0,i had a chance i would rate this place as -1 was on my way to another place but did not check the timings and the place was closed when i reached quickly searched for other mediterranean places nearby and called olive to find out if the place was open the guy on the phone seemed very friendly and asked me what i would like to order and he could have it ready for pickup i asked him if i could taste the chicken before ordering it and he said that would be fine i am a new and very reluctant chicken eater in my quest to eat more protein so based on this info i decided to head over to this placethe billing desk was swamped with several waitresses and yet it took me a few minutes to request for someone's assistance and look at the menu it took even longer to get someone to take my order  the girl i spoke to told me that they did not have sample options and i could not taste to see i understood but told her about my phone convo few minutes ago with someone at their restaurant she went to get an older lady who was possibly the manager or something mona the woman told me that they could not me taste anything as they need to prepare big batches of food for each order seperately her tone seemed condescending and even though i was ready to walk out of the place i decided to order the chicken na na as they told me it was goodthe chicken na na was supposed to be a tender marinated chicken served with lettuce and tomato and house garlic sauce i asked for the dish without the pita bread to take out now i may be wrong here but i think i read the price as 695 but the waitress charged 895 plus tax for thisthe only thing worth mentioning in the dish was the garlic sauce in a yogurt base and it was pretty good the chicken was dry with what seemed like herbs and spices thrown over there was nothing tender about the chicken and i ended up taking a few bites and wasting the restcannot comment on the ambience as i took my order to go they could seriously benefit by having a few customer oriented staff members and improving the quality of foodvery dissapointed and will not return even if this is the only place food is available
0,going to start off by saying that this review is pretty much exclusively for the service i have been here several times with my boyfriend (we have never had a service issue until now) and the hookah is always good the drinks are so-so but reasonably priced and i absolutely love the decor however after last night i'm not sure i will ever patronize this place again if i could give it 0 stars i would my boyfriend and i were meeting up with his uncle and friend who were already there when we got there we needed to be moved to a bigger table since they were sitting at a two seat one it took us 5 minutes to get the waitress to come over despite that there were only three other small groups in the place when she did come over she rolled her eyes and made a snarky comment about us moving table (the only thing we had was a hookah that needed to be movedand she put us at the next table over so i would think that wouldn't be a big deal)after we moved she disappeared for 20 minutes when we were finally able to get drinks she disappeared for another 45 minutes (this is not an exaggeration either) during the whole visit this server made us feel like we were inconveniencing her by being in her breathing space when we asked her for anything her attitude made the whole group uncomfortable every time she would come over and though we had intended to get some dinner as well while we were there we finally got tired of being scared to ask her for anything so we just requested the bill when we nicely asked her to split it (and i was being beyond patient at this point i'm not someone who loses my temper with servers) she gave us a disgusted look and took an incredibly short nasty tone with us but ultimately did it this was no embellishing the worst and rudest service i have ever received in my life my boyfriend and i were more than happy to leave and go across the street the blue fin where they were more than happy to have our business
0,came here for a friends surprise birthday party i arrived around 9 pm so it was pretty empty in the place i was surprised at the size and amount of chairs they have to seat people very nice dark layout it could deem as a great place to chill and hang out with friends after a long day however the service here is a bit lacking there were a lot of waitresses that night and they were huddling around the bar anticipating whether or not it'd be a busy night as i heard through their conversations it was really dead and it was my first time there so i had no idea how it was on a busy night i was really hungry while waiting for more people to arrive so i ordered a beef wrap and some hummus both weren't bad at all i thought it was weird that the server took my card and opened up a tab for me as i was intentionally planning on not drinking that night but i didn't say anything about it to her anyway more people started arriving about an hour later and the lounge gradually started filling up as well we had a whole row of seats and couches for our party but as more people started showing up the servers started to get anxious as we were flowing out of the specific area they had for us there were also several hookahs out it seemed as if they didn't want all that business for them or couldn't handle that many people they ended up making all of us get up and relocate into this bland side room which was away from all the music so it was a really weird atmosphere it wasn't as comfortable as the lounge seating they had for typical guests but they said we were taking up too much room out there apparently we did not get much service in this room either i understand it turned into a pretty busy night but i think they could've used another waitress or two to staff our large party when i finally received my tab at the end of the night i noticed they double charged me on my bill the waitress seemed a little upset about this even though it wasn't my fault claiming that someone else had charged me extra not her but she refunded me in cash so it was okay the whole ordeal and events of the night made me feel like i never wanted to come back again at least the people i was with made the night a little more enjoyable
0,service i am a regular here and i get treated like garbage i understand barry is playing but come on you guys are not that busy i have been getting better service at other lounges i understand you guys close at 12 but dont bother me with the bill ill pay when i want to do not rush me to be honest i rate a 0 its not the same without joe
0,have been coming here for months with my girlfriend to come check out barry black and his crew including preston both from the voice i came with my girlfriend sitting like always the manager came up and told us not to be us basically homophobic asss manager disgusted barry and the crew should be playing elsewhere it's 2014 and hate and discrimination should not be tolerated sorry not sorry that my lady and i are attractive lesbians too bad we are close with the musicians  the bartenders are amazing and same with the hookah hosts the owner needs to burry a hole 6 feet under for herself
0,like it's back to the drawing boards with submission we had been asked last minute by hookah palace to run our weekly promotion giving us two days to prepare for the first week needless to say it was a flop then week two was a little better yet we did not bring down the house any good promoter will tell you that it is almost impossible to pack a place the size of a football field that does not already have clientele in the first week and a half of promotion we need to be cleaver and run several promotions and develop a crowd yet hookah palace was disappointed that we did not create a miracle hookah palace decided to let us know when we accidentally called them that we would no longer be welcome there this was on tuesday two days prior to the event flyers were printed invites were sent out extra promoters were hires we were also getting ready to set up our dj battle which we discussed with hookah palace would run for five weeks i guess we were lucky in that we did not start that up as soon as we would hope in the end we are disappointed with hookah palace and the way they operate don't cancel on someone two days prior to an event last time house of don productions will operate under a gentleman's agreement that is for sure thank you for listening douglas farrapresidenthouse of don productions
0,place sucks hairy balls expensive tiny weak drinks and a cover charge on some nights it is in a crappy off strip location so you would think there would be an incentive to encourage patrons to visit and come back we will not be back it cost my boyfriend $20 bucks for a mini sized cranvodka and mini sized soda in a cup full of ice that along with the cover charge to get into this small dark and hot joint i feel we were raped of our money never again
0,this place is ghetto heaven lol asked around about a place that plays hip hop and was told about this place when i pull up in the parking lot a fight was breaking up at the door i was subject to a wand i was thinking what has happened here to warrant all this inside is dirty as well everyone cramps into one area close to the dj booth though there are lots of other areas only pluses about this place is the nice lady in the bathroom and the potential this place has if only they would clean it up i doubt if every come back here upset i wasted $20 i think i stay for about 15 minutes and went elsewhere
0,much cigarette smoke and crowed ass hell people here are ghetto dj was ok to many fights dance floor is really small it feels like a sauna lol its not my type of crowd
0,again worst experience ever very ghetto and in professional we paid for bottle service and once our bottle was done we was booted from our table  was told someone else had just brought the table smh but no other table got extra bottles are were forced to move from their table  then i got outside and s guy is in my car searching  how did he get in who know where was security  never again ppl make this ur last result  this place needs some improvement on services for sure  more ac  and air freshener the club has a  funny smell to it
0,service ever we were a party of 10 had a reservation and you think they care about your reservation heck no waited for our table for an hour no body came check on us we have been waiting by an empty table no apologies and when we ask about the table they were really mean and rude the hostess was not doing her job and they ended up kicking us out because they were upset how impatient we were no i think anyone would be upset waiting for reservation for that long worst experience ever will defiantly not go there again
0,sure i'd evem give them 1 starfalse advertising menu on yelp states lentil soup is made with olive oil   upon driving out of way here i was informed by an authentic looking & sounding soup nazi that it's soy oil  there will be no soup for me here
0,place was way worse than what i expected there's only one grumpy person running the whole place so it took forever for the food to get ready he doesn't talk or even smile servings are small for the price ($14 for my meal) and the food was not fresh falafels were like subway's and i think they were frozen (no spice or taste at all) no silverware or glassware whatsoever; everything was disposable we ended up paying $45 for 3 people without any drinks he has shawerma but no gyros machine all i saw was shredded pieces of meat that he heats up i'm never coming back to this place
0,to be great now there's a new owner he smokes inside the store menu the same but the portions are smaller sad i won't go back
0,came here around 7:15p tonih we walked in and read the sign that said to seat yourself and we did the man behind the to go order counter area clearly saw us walk in we waited  and waited for about ten minutes we waited for something anything  we got nothing completely ignored we left i wonder if the people who went in as we were leaving got the same treatment
0,am disappointed to say that the customer is not first nor right at princess they have forgotten who keeps them in business it is paying customers the buffet last night was horriblepicked over nothing left and the staff (family) on duty could care less because they ate first when i asked for it to be replenished their response was "kitchen's closed sorry " this was at 8:15 pm the buffet started at 7:30 i am sorry to say i will no longer be making the 20 min drive and giving my business to this once great family owned business unfortunately the service has diminished greatly with the passing of the owner he would be ashamed how his staff (family) treated their guests this has been the 2nd time in as many weeks sadbecause i really enjoyed the food i hope they figure it out quickly because at this pace they won't be around to carry on the family business

0,place was so weird  i had heard good things from friends (and other yelpers) but i was so disappointedmy fella and i went for lunch on a saturday afternoon and were the only customers there ()  we were shown to a table by a unfriendly gentleman who did not smile or greet us in any way he returned to take our order gave us a cold glare to tell us that he disapproved of our choices and then wandered off to the kitchen  we could hear him yelling at the cook to "make sure to make my vegetarian lasagna without meat in it" yeah thanks i would appreciate that  eventually he brought us our food scowled and left us alone for the rest of our meal  what was up with this old man  who ran over his puppyalso someone was fiddling with the music in the place eventually deciding we should all listen to hip-hop  :|the food was tasty but the experience ruined it  i won't be coming back anytime soon
0,still in pissy mood at going 0 for 3 in last new restaurant attempts  once again a brief review filled with disappointment and regret  started with the spanakopita which was labelled as a spinach cheese pie for $395  it was cold  what should have been flaky heavenly goodness in the form of phyllo dough was just greasy congealed torture which was quite impressive with how this was so damn cold  maybe they should've left this in the microwave longer  blahentree that was recommended as their house specialty was their oven roasted lamb for $1195  it was halfway edible as the rice was sorta interesting with pine nuts for a nice crunch but was a little dry  and then the lamb  it probably wouldn't be fair to say it was dry it would be more fair to say it was arizonan desert sand masquerading as meat  damnit so disappointed again i can't even think of a witty way to end this review  god bless the edit button i'll have to come back with something
0,owner was nice but very pushy on me ordering the specials they didn't have what i wanted (grilled chicken burger) so i went with a falafel which seemed to upset him my order came with soup i chose lentil that was very good the falafel however was just not good at all my tastebuds just could not agree with the sauce or ingredients
0,was the first mediterranean place i had in az i didn't feel like making dinner that night and was craving falafel so i looked on yelp and found the 4 star review one of the highest and closest to me the pictures looked authentic and delicious i should've stayed home and saved my money it's a hole in the wall which i ordinarily like and can be a good indication of authenticity the 1 star is for an attempt at a restaurant the atmosphere and service wasn't bad the falafel though -- worst i've ever had it's dried out and flavorless i judge a mediterranean place on how good their falafel is and this was terrible i hardly wanted to finish it but did because i was hungry the server -- i think he was the owner -- recommended a red wine and i sprang for it it was almost skunked so he clearly pushed it on me to get rid of it gross
0,rating is for service was greeted promptly and quickly shown to a table where we waited & waited & waited no water no service left an went somewhere else
0,called to inquire about their menu and was meet with some resistance the person who answered the phone would only tell me to come in and see the decor and and menu i thought it was a joke and asked again but to no avail didn't get anywhere this place put a bad taste in my mouthssh
0,am not persian but embarressed to see the wine called royal kirreshouldnt be there royal kircome onbe nicefilemignone was not very bad but nothing compare to atlantas rumis
0,was the worst persian food i have ever had the service was even worse than the food i will never go there again i have been in many persian restaurants in la and the bay area this one stands at the bottom of the list i recommend anything else but habib
0,it owner is crazy and does not treat customers with respect
0,had heard some things about the owner (habib) saying that he was a rude person etc etc during the time i lived in las vegas i dined there 2 or 3 times and didn't experience anything too bad but during my last visit during a trip to las vegas i had an experience with the owner that makes me doubt that i will ever be going back again i had always heard that the owner was rude and finally saw it with my own eyeshabib was taking our order my mother asked if the fish was fresh and habib said yes my father asked again in the most polite words and soft spoken friendly respectful tone of voice if the fish was fresh or fresh frozen (my dad eats a lot of fish) habib snapped back in a rude confrontational and aggressive tone of voice and said "i already answered you once i do not need your business" i was frankly shocked this was after my father had earlier paid him a compliment on his restaurant when we first got there frankly it ruined our mood our meal and whole evening my mother at this point preferred to leave but we were already there settled in tired from travel and we stayed and ate our foodthe persian food here is reasonably good nothing spectacular but not disappointing the prices are high for what is offered though there are other places in town with better persian food (see reviews for royal persis and form your own opinion) but the physical location etc is not quite as nice although my limited interactions with the owner there have been pretty pleasant the inside of habib's is more upscale say if you wanted to bring a guest from out of town but frankly with an owner that can pop off at any moment does it really matter he can ruin any physical attributes the restaurant has with a few wordsthe other wait staff were pretty friendly i think they may know that the owner acts the way he does and may try to make up for it (or are just trying to avoid pissing him off themselves)
0,star went to habib's with my elder parentsfamily habib the owner also server snapped impatiently right when we walked-in to get seated  he seemed to be having a bad day and took it out on my parents and i  he took my moms order and when my mom mentioned she does not want her food overly cooked he was impatient and rude  my dad wanted to get seated over by the window and he was denied  when he asked for an explanation habib said to him i'm diabetic and can not carry the food from the kitchen to the widow seat near the entry where my dad preferred to get seated  habib said to my dad i'm the owner also management here and i won't allow you to sit there if you don't like it then leave  by then habib had taken five of our orders when it was my turn to order i was the only one at the table who's order was not taken by habib taken-back by habib's rude behavior i set down the menu and didn't want to order food therefore he asked me to leave on front of my family and raced to my seat as well as personal space as if he's going to hit me  i got up words were exchanged and he ran to the front grabbing a phone and threatening to call the police  we were certainly not treated with any respecti would not recommend this restaurant to anyone  habib is a rude jerk and don't know what else to say that was 30 minutes into our arrival to las vegas and starting our family vacation
0,owner was absolutely rude i came with 3 friends he was acting as if we own him for coming there food was ok not the best persian food i tried but not the worse too bad the owner does ruin his business with his attitude because i would of came back if it wasnt for horrible service i received too bad he lost 4 customers because none of us will support this business
0,took a party of 6 friends and co-workers there last week when attending a tradeshow in vegas  i will never do that againbiggest issue:  the bill came and i noticed just about 30% added to the bill as "tax"  yes 30%  when i asked the server about it he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 81% as tax  and that that is explained in the menu  i have several issues with this:1 shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print  my mistake but if you are reading this review you don't have to make this mistake2 why am i forced to leave an 18% tip  the tip is not at my discretion  if the server is not helpful i can't express myself in any way  3 why is listed as "tax"  i bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically  that is stealing4 now it gets worse:  i asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 81% tax that adds up to 261%  so why is there an almost 30% charge  they add 81% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it  so the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%food:  it was no special in any way  i am very familiar with persian food  i have had it in many cities and many countries  i look for persian restaurants everywhere i go  this restaurant is not bad but it is not good either  the food in no way justifies the prices they charge  i had chicken with bones and it was not cooked well  for appetizer we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan and we had it with two kinds of stew  tadig was good but not enough for 6 people  stews were ok but again not specialservice:  it was ok  the server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming  he was not rude or anything but i felt like we were bothering him being there  and the place was not busy  the service in no way justified more than 18% in tip  but think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way  i will not recommend this place:  not for food not for service and not for being overcharged
0,is the rudest meanest uglyist guy i have ever seen as a owner of restaurant he treats his persian customer so badly like he is living in iran or afghanestan  he thinks persian people here don't have any right in his restaurant  last time we were a party of 10  waiting 2 hours  not that it was crowded  but because he just had one waiter  the worker are terrified of him  the food has very low quality small portion  uncooked but the price was so high he charged 35% gratitude which comes with the bill and we had no choice  but to pay  bad experience  never go back and don't suggested to anyone don't let the environment follish you
0,if there is a way to give zero stars i would give it i took my friends with his kids and my family there for lunch while visiting the city for a trade show shame on me for not reading the reviewswaiter: the waiter like others reported on their reviews was the owner he was rude impatient and not interested in providing a traditional service my son is only tow years old and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste so i politely asked if i could have an extra plate waiter was fast to add that he charges $5 for sharing a plate the first time i heard of such foolish charge  our table was in an area where the waiter couldn't reach three of my guests and we told him that we can pass things down to him he got upset and made a snappy remark food:  the food was about average  most of us ordered the same dish and we all had meat that were not cooked all the way we mentioned it to him at the end of our meal just to bring it to his attention all and all the experience was horrible and i do t recommend this to anyone
0,is the worst service (or worst non-service) i have ever experienced since i can't give zero stars i'm giving the service one we didn't eat anything so i can't comment on the food my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night we stood at the empty hostess stand for a while when no one came to seat us and we couldn't find anyone to seat us we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to dothe bar was full but not packed there were only two other tables with guests one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience after what seemed like forever my husband got up to find a server he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone but couldn't he then tried to ask the bartender but she was just as elusive when he finally found a server  she acted totally shocked that we were there maybe if someone had been doing their job they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurantshe came to our table got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order when we said no she said she would be back we could see her chit chatting with another server but again couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order after another ten minutes of waiting for her to return we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left we ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way hometwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks such a waste of time it took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there 25 of waiting and another 20 to get home that's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work i used to work as a server so i could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed but it was basically a dead night table top wise i will never go back
0,hate this place i have been here many times and i am just finally getting around to writing a review  let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said i need to indulge their interests even if they suck buffalo blues is like a hooters except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking the service is horrendous and the food may be better at hooters  the beer selection is decent at buffalo blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the boardmy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly i don't get it you get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time the problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals  so the max you could eat is 55 wings did i mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a jackson pollack painting  they also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch  the wings do not come with celery this is a crime against humanity and the city of buffalo  i chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich apparently this was a bad choice  it took a full hour to get my food it was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem when my meal did arrive everything was cold the sandwich was ok but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorlessi paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave  i would say i won't go back but apparently i like my friends more than i like good food and service
0,here this past saturday afternoon 112 my friends and i sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service the bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there as we walked out we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting we went next door to mad mex and got much better service
0,be honest i think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city  the food was sub-par even for bar food the service was awful especially during a game i do enjoy a good sports bar but i think the thing i hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there it's the quintessential shadyside bar equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the jersey shore bimbos who pine for them the last time that i went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk i fully admit this is a subjective review because this bar was obviously not my scene- but i still do not like this place at all
0,the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues we sat down and put in our drink order  my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap fifteen minutes later and still without drinks we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down once the bartender finally started working on our drinks she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped we were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her then the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one anyway long story short it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar we will not be back
0,a bartender serve a guy a beer when he was visibly intoxicated he was swaying in circles on the chair next to me i told the manager about it and he told me "that guy is just crazy i've seen him much worse" so i guess that makes it ok made this paying customer leave after one beer
0,been to buffalo blues a few times at happy hour and met my daughter there last night for happy hour specials as advertised on the web site  first clue:  no happy hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the yeungs and wings (which was not what we were looking for)  we came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted  the food was awful the service worse  maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess  the service:  one beer to the table at a time  next round i saw two beers go to a three-top removed and sent to the bar poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us  someone else's food was brought to our table our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in  so we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste  we ate two each then told the server we didn't want them  she offered to take them off but we told her that wasn't necessary so they took off 12 the price as a customer service gesture  still we had a happy hour bill for 12 eaten fries barely touched wings and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table  at least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere  i think we're done here
0,off i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible sometimes that's not possible - in the future i'll avoid this one no matter whatits always a zoo the servers are not interested in what they are doing and do it poorly food comes out of order or not at all the managers don't care we actually had a waitress spill the soup catch most of it in her hand and dump it back in right in front of us then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another just go anywhere else it can't be worse
0,one would think one chain restaurant is just like the rest but i have had nothing but problems here the staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something i've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; i ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though i've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained
0,overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff still sitting here waiting for someone to give a careso we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server michael she was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen michael our server finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again he does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes the manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it he informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes he goes away i cut into my steak and it's you guessed it pittsburgh rare i asked for medium rare he returns and i tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak the manager apologizes again and asks me if i want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle i said no thanks he comped my husband's meal and we left i never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining i will never go back to this applebee's again
0,does this place always smell bad seriously the second you walk through the door it's vaguely sewer-ish their roof deck is okay and i am honestly glad that not every establishment in lebo is high-end but overall i'm not a fan
0,have been robbed twice by the saloon  someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the saloon make absolutely sure that you check you bank statement the next day after the first time i wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time i was flabbergasted  i went in on some yeungling special night ordered one beer and wrote a dollar tip  the next morning i checked my statement and i had been charged 2500 for that single beer  this is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud  but they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it  if you do have to go here i implore you to only use cash and look at your change carefully this bar should be your absolute last resort in mt lebanonat closing time as well get ready for the mt lebo police dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are walking home  there are other great bars in mt lebanon that are far more deserving of your money
0,of all the website as i was told "has been down for 4 years" - even though it is very up the specials and menu prices are apparently wrongmy friends and i chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $350 20 oz guinness we needed a place to celebrate our graduation with a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the guinness we were drinking was actually $550really it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass it was one of those damn plastic cups when we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price at that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place and you can absolutely find much cheaper guinness in this city the guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called false advertising and it's a dick move mr william penn
0,waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink i have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life
0,with mike b i have visited 2 fox & hound bars now (the other up in huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food both had good beer selection tvs and space but the food - no i got the fish sandwich at the huntersville location - poor choice i got the chicken sandwch at the tryon location - looked like it belonged on the kids menu; and it took 30 minutes so it was also dry i initially thought i'd give the place a 2nd chance - 2 for 2 bad food experiences is enough
0,a bad experience a group of us came to charlotte from cheyenne for a training course and wanted a good local place have dinner and drinks the place wasn't busy at all and it took 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get out drink order taken and get our beverages the food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm i assure you i will not return to this establishment on this trip or any future trips
0,abomination certainly left much to be desired there was a considearble wait from the ordering of drinks to receiving them again to order food and even longer to get our food when it finally came they had mixed up who ordered what wrong sides with the entree etc all of our orders from the 3 steaks to the sampler platter to the mini chili dogs were lukewarm at best one of the steaks even managed to taste like they had dropped it into the bottom of the grill think smokey like campfire-smelling clothes smokey but flavored that waythe manager comped a portion of our meals but the apparent lack of cusomer service and quality control more than overshadowed his attempt to make things right i refuse to ever set foot in this sub-par establishment again
0,for ever just to get water and to take our order we were there for over an hour before we got our food and it was cold will not return
0,has allowed me to try new restaurants in places i never knew existedi have been to uptown many times and never noticed fox and hound that could also be rock bottom brewery sits across the street and makes this place seem so much smaller my visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking it also is dnc week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street luckily we found one after circling 4 times we walked in and it was awkward one of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this itsawkward we found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted we waited looked around and waited some more began looking around saw a bartender and that was it no waitress no one else walking around wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak it would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten after 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu really we counted 3 parties thats itin a otherwise bare restaurant food was good received it pretty quickly our drinks were refilled often without being asked first impressions really do matter it wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them from reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues really felt like we were being intentionally ignored we did something we  have never done intentionally left without leaving a tip the one person who was polite happened to be the person who was in the next room cleaning kinda ironic since she doesn't assist the people actually dining will not be back
0,just received the worst service ever i will never come back its shocking that on wing special night it was merly 6 tables one person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks we had to ask for everything numerous of times service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly i personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making i hated to make so many complaints but i've never experienced such horrible service it was awful we couldn't find any positive in it as a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks it was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks we told the management we needed to pay another check and that we didn't know why the waitress would leave one out his response was unprofessional  :(
0,you say "ug" so there are lots of tvs and there was the same game on for all 40 sets this seemed quite bizarre also why have 4 screens when you can have one huge one why advertise fresh squeezed lemonade when it's from a package why give french fries with most of them burned why not have a vegetarian burger in addition to all the artery clogging ones the reason for the one star was that our waitress was cool and very courteous
0,of atmosphere (even during sporting events)food is terriblebartenderwaitress were incredibly rudeeverybody has bad days they should not be this bad
0,a long black hair in my burger the buns were cold the meat patty was overcooked (asked for medium) and very thin the side salad was decent the tea tasted like crap and the food took foreeeeever to come the waitress shifted from friendly to rude and then back i was thinking about asking her if she had a evil twin sister or something
0,don't know who of my group picked this place out but they never owned up to it the service was absolutely terrible  the waitress was practically all but ignoring us  we only got offered one round of drinks never asked if we wanted a second round  we had to ask for our silverwarenapkins after our food came and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal all the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something she would immediately come back to their table not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return) aside from just being terrible she was also unfriendly  as for the food all my friends seemed to enjoyappreciate their meals  for about 8-10$ you get a huge sandwichburger and a side of fries  except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to meas a vegetarian it was entirely another matter for me  not wanting a "veggie" burger i ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedgeschips + vegetables off the appetizer menu  what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip when i asked the waitress if i was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well she said "yeah it should come with it" as if i was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says  it wasn't actually until i explained the vegetable part was the reason i ordered this dish that she "offered" to get them for me  she disappears ten minutes later my friends halfway through their meal no vegetables in sight but at least we have silverware and napkins now  five minutes later she hears us loudly complaining and says shes told the kitchen twice now yeah right another ten minutes later we're complaining real loud now to ourselves because no staff member is in sight  soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes  my cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm at best he returns and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before i can complain about: three 6-inch cuts of celery and two 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot completely raw  it took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation  we immediately asked for a box and a discount yes he discounted us 10% of our final bill which i think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips plus half of my beer  the waitress brought it out as one check too not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples) would have wanted the check splitthe kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read "charlotte's finest"  methinks not
0,only gave them 1 star because 0 wasn't an option food was mediocre (fries were cold) and we haven't seen our waitress in 45 minutes (writing this review while waiting to ask for the check) i'll write another review tomorrow if i'm still here waiting
0,service i can handle (took about 20 mintues to get two glasses of water) and we were there over an hour and a half (during a slow time) to get two cheesesteaks  average food expected just looking for something quick and close  the icing on the cake was when the waitress lost my credit card  now i realize this could easily happen however she didn't bother to tell me that she lost it  finally after her being gone 20 minutes with my card we found her and asked her what the delay was to which she responded "did i by chance give you back your credit card"  my first thought was tell me right away so i can call the bank  i told her that and her response was "i know but i was so embarrassed"  luckily they found our card eventually but if someone else had found it they could do a lot of damage in 20 minutes with all the shops around thereas a side note during our long horrible experience two other groups came in and left after about 20 minutes of not even having a waiterwaitress say boo to them  i wish we had seen their experiences before we orderedi wish 0 stars was an option i would have chosen it
0,were staying at the hotel it's located in (the marriott) and we couldn't go anywhere because it was raining horrible experiencefirst we got in and had to search for a table once we found one (which was dirty) we waited about 10 minutes for the server to clean it once we finally sat she took our drink orders and came back soon after for our dinner orders i asked which was her favorite from the sandwhiches and she said the philly liarbesides the fact that it took 45 min yes 45 for us to get out food when the food got there it was all really shitty the meat inside my philly was burnt to a crisp along with the cheese which was so burnt parts of it were black the bread was cold and hard fries were ok by this point we were so hungry we just ate after we were sitting with our plates in front of us for about 20 min i decided to get up and go get the checks myself she gave them to me and i walked them to my table myself took the credit cards myself and gave them to her we had to go it was getting way too lategranted it was st patricks day and the place was packed but when that happens you need to ask for help
0,in for a couple drinks and food it was so slow that i actually asked one of the employees if they were closing with that being said drinks came out pretty fast but that was it waited about 15 minutes for the bartender to take our order which we cashed out and moved on to another place to eat there were more employees in the restaurant than guests and ironically there were a couple of them enjoying a meal at a table in the dining room in front of customers who couldn't even order an appetizer in a reasonable time no management present that we could see seems like a place that has given up
0,used to like this place but then i tried paying for a small item with my debit card at a bead store and was told i needed to buy a minimum of 10$ if i were to buy anything from them i was told the same thing from the guy selling knives and also the lady selling avon that would have been 30$ i was charged for 5$ worth of trinkets when i brought up this usery at their website to correct they told me to shop somewhere else(what a bunch of jerks) so i told them i would make sure to get the word out to whomever would listen to 'not waste your time there' besides in the wintertime all they sell is the same thing row after row anyways in the summertime it is overpriced and not worth the trip to drive out there the mall is much more affordable ironic isn't it
0,reply from the swapmeet employee but think about this- charging a 10$ minimum is still extortion (an excessive or exorbitant charge)
0,place sucks they have 99cent store stuff selling for 5x the price lol save your time and go anywhere else
0,never seen so many old shoes in all my life
0,like your lost in a third world country nothing but garbage
0,was not impressed if your looking for 50's style stuff that is a bit overpriced this is the place for you personally i like older antiques then that the people inside weren't very friendly either
0,super disappointed  i drove over 30 minutes yesterday to get there only to find they closed 10 minutes early i showed a guy named keith my i phone that read 5:50 and all he could say was he goes by their clock this guy keith has been rude to me in the past but i keep going back because i love the great stuff there in fact i have to go back today :( to get what i wanted yesterday keith told me the owners name was michael but i can't seem to find him or his email address
0,seen something so useless in my life a bunch of small stores with no good things smells weird and there isn't even a lot of stores to be honest everyone looks like they don't wanna be there which sucks place isn't good at all don't waste your money on junk
0,is pretty big with no vendors  alot of spaces are open and the building has horrible smell filling the air almost like a combo of body odor and century old clothes  i was here to get info on vendorrenting space but there is absolutely no shoppers and experience was awful  i am get the idea that building ownersmanagement of the swap meet must be pretty bad with all the spaces open and no renters  my personal first time experiencewhile walking up to the office to get info  i witnessed something that no shopper or person should have to go through  so there was middle eastern lady that was working or managing in the office yelling horrible things at a shopper who lost a child about how horrible a person she was and that she was not going to take her child until the police arrived whoa little kid was ok and mother was in tears  i totally felt bad for the mother because we all have had that horrible experience of losing a kid in non familiar place and just want to comfort your child  i was almost about to say something but totally shocked when security with turbans  started harassing the whole family all the way out of the building  pretty traumatic experience and will not go back to shop or sell whatsoever  i am sure that poor family won't be returning either and must i say don't loose your child there geesh
0,place had this awful smell to it wasn't sure what it was but smelled something like dirty clothes that have been wet a few day the prices are high at most the vendors stands that i went to there is no food that i seen so if your hungry this isn't the place to come once you smell the inside you will most likely lose your appetite anyway the management is rude and dont speak much english or any spanish when asked a question they simply ignore you or say the don't understand i will not be returning because there was nothing that was of any use to me i will stick to the arizona mills good prices and ac something the indoor swap meet didn't have running
0,was very disappointedrude employees pushed service away  i had prepared an anniversary date for my husband and i i had called in asking if i needed to make an appt or reservation and they told me no just come in so we went to dinner first and arrived at this place at 8:10 they close at 9 and take their last sitting at 8:15 their "open" sign was already off i walked in and no one was at the front you can tell they were cleaning up so i asked if my husband and i could come in and she said no sorry we are closing i was looking at the clock and she said yeah we take our last people at 8:15 well it was only 8:10 so we had 5 mins right nope she was completely rude and made me walk out i was so bummed because our awesome date i had plan was cut short i will be finding another place to go and hope that the owners or managers will find new employees because it is a cute place
0,walked in with all the intentions of painting a piece i knew exactly the quote colors and kind of oiece i wanted i just needed help getting it altogether the girl working was so rude and unhelpful she didn't try to help me find a piece and she walked away and went back to cleaning and stocking and then was on the phone with a personal call so i walked out and will never return such a cute and seemingly fun place but the employees need to be nicer and trained better such a shame
0,try to support local business but in this case it backfired took a pretty basic framing job to artarama and spent a good amount of time providing instructions when it came time to pick it up it was not ready in fact they finally delivered it a week after they committed but that was only the first problemdespite all of the instructions the matting was done incorrectly with a wrong color and a wrong style now back at square one i would not recommend jerrys artarama if you want quality and value your time
0,though i asked several employees in the store not one would help beyond pointing to a wall i came to the store with a list and left with nothing el lardo at the cash register couldn't be bothered though i think i might have been one of two customers there he was busy shoving what looked to be chicharrones into his pie hole i left and drove over to az art supply next to sprouts on southern az art supply showed me where everything was and i left within 15 minutes with $110 worth of supplies
0,went here with our kids at 745pm and the girl working there could not have been more un helpful rushed us dissapeared was totally unhelpful if you post a closing time be open to that time
0,visiting the brush bar our standard on painting and wine drinking were set high the art of merlot lacks character enthusiasms and creativity with no guidance you are left on your own recreating a complicated painting for $45 you get a $3 canvas and a couple dollars worth of paint and you're expected to bring your own wine the staff was nice enough but lacked enthusiasm and guidance that the brush bar had needless to say i would always choose the brush bar for a night of art and wine
0,was a huge disappointment i have been wanting to go here for months and last night my gf and i went and it was not good at all the girl teaching the class did nooooooooo teaching or explaining the entire time she kept saying it was imaginative we came to learn not to throw paint on a canvas that looks like a mess i could have done that at home for less money the teacher barely spoke she just painted while the rest of the class talked worst $45 i have ever spent will never go back unless i want to waste my money it's said because this is my first ever review on yelp and hate that it's a negative one but the girl even had the adasity to ask for tipswhat she did nothing i have been to other places in town and have loved them stinks that i can't add this one to my list of rotation
0,is a bar trying to be more the small plates were heavy and riffs on burgers and fries the beer selection is what you would find at harris teeters and is marked up go to gallery 22 if you want an amazing selection of beer better prices and a true tapas restaurant upstairs
0,service; took us 2 and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items (then added a few beers we didn't order on to our tab; i'm assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice) then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check in the time we argued about it you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with ithad to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch i would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if i could have; but we got gratted so i didn't even have that optionif you want to come here with more than 3 people avoid d's their beer is severely overpriced ($10 for a beer i can get at sharp edge for $6 no thanks) and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in pittsburghin other words don't come here i used to like this place but tonight was such a bad experience i'll just go to one of the other places in pittsburgh that serves hot dogs french fries and beer there are plenty of them i won't miss d's at all
0,tried to go here for the second time today  i say tried because i sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging i was there  i ended up going next door to the map room for lunchthe first time i had gone i had a server come and take my order a kitchen guy ran it out and then no one ever came back for 45 mins  i went to the counter for my check and thought that i wouldn't give it another go  well you can't say i didn't try i had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad but its not a place i'd make my go to pizza place
0,time i come here hoping just hoping that i'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs raw unfiltered old school like a ballpark from the 1920's or somethingbut each time i come away disappointed even more than last timemy father worked here three or four decades ago i'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friendsthe service is anywhere from good to great and they are fast and friendlyand maybe just maybe i come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long at odd hours or an hour after the rushevery time the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock  not a snappy casing no this is like barely edible hard exteriorso what's a man to do try again  sadly i'll probably forget about my recent experiences and try them againi just hope they are fresher next time because i can't imagine them worse than today
0,almost hate writing this review because green's is such a charlotte institution i almost feel like i'm dissing my adopted city by saying this but i just don't see what the big deal is about this place when i first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as the varsity in atlanta news tip: they aren't and they aren't by a longshot what's worse the three or four times i've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent maybe the hot dog is cold but the chili is hot i dunno i want to like this place but just can't
0,confused here tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the fargo last week when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me so i walked away and went to another dog stand is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart
0,is one of those places where the hype is bigger than reality  sure it's an institution of a business that somehow survived the times without changing the decor for decades  but the hot dogs aren't impressive at all i was actually quite disappointed by them  in my order i got two carolina style dogs (mustard onions slaw and chili) with fries and a drink  the drink is inundated with tons of ice which quickly waters down any flavor the soda may have had  the fries were so-so nothing fancy about crinkle-cut  the dogs were disappointing since the hot dogs are cooked in a water pot they should be dried off a little before putting in the bun; well they didn't do that and i had a soggy buns as a result  the slaw and chili didn't have any real flavor to them and probably would have been better without because of the mess  overall i couldn't finish both dogs because it got too messy and tasted blah with the wet bunhonestly i have had better hot dogs from the green's lunch cart located in front of wells fargo than the actual location  prices are the same cheap and that lady doesn't mess around with soggy buns  if you want green's lunch go to the cart not the establishment  overall there are better hot dog places in uptown though will cost more
0,know what the deal was but on a day with a car show across the street and a basketball game a couple blocks away we were one of about 3 parties which rolled up for lunch only to find the place closed who knows how many folks did the same thing considering the posted saturday hours then again about half of uptown was closed clt remains at heart a town by for and of bankers sad
0,customer service and when i talked to the manager she apologized but you can tell she didn't care
0,not eat here  they have the worst customer service  i don't go out to eat to be given an attitude  i expect courteous service
0,place sucks i am from chicago just recently sentenced to the valley but i will tell you what the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill i mean they were rude unfriendly and their food reflected there attitudeit sucked owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's "chicago style" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference the reality is that if you were on clark st competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark your food is bland and nasty your employees seem like extras from the movie "coma" and look like they could use an fmla day and your place is unkempt and dirty i pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers it would not be hard next time i will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt finally try using real vienna giardinara peppers not your own creation because your way off by the way i will post a link to view your county health inspection for all to see have a windy city day buckaroo
0,am from chicago and i feel places should be care full about trying to title there places with anything chicago in az those are mighty big shoes to fill with that said this place is totally over ratedi mean we got a hot dog served as a sandwichnot in chicago for this i will stick to what the valley is  known for and go to in and out or lenny's quit it
0,place has an awful smell the condiments table is super dirty and my chicago beef was lackluster
0,food was great the customer service was horrible i called in an order and asked for it to be split into three when i arrived to pay the man at the register basically scolded me telling me he wasn't going to make other people wait in line while he split my order the person on the phone did not tell me this was a policy i won't be back he was rude and it was completely uncalled for maybe the person taking phone orders needs some training
0,close at 8 but will serve the person in front of you if they know them and the doors are unlocked at 8:30 oh and while the place is packed and you're not the only on in live willing to pay a+ customer service
0,have never been treated so rude owner has anger issues do not give this store your business
0,they closed now this phone number says it's disconnected would be nice to have it forward to another location i miss fiesta mall i remember it when it was brand new seeing santa it was the hot spot to hang out back in the day ;-)
0,longer in business or at least at fiesta mall and phone number has been disconnected
0,man  i was so embarrassed when a delivery was made by this establishment to my boyfriend's mom  so i ordered a $65 arrangement (not including the $18 delivery charge) via teleflora (a rose shack is one of their subcontractors) and it was an embarrassment what they sent  also the order was supposed to come with a lenox bowl which was why i chose the arrangement  did they send the arrangement with a lenox bowl  nope  did they notify me that they were going to send an awful replacement nope  so disappointing  got my money back through teleflora went to whole foods off the strip and bought a much more attractive arrangement for the fraction of the price ($45) and delivered it myself  perhaps there was a miscommunication between a rose shack and teleflora and they aren't completely to blame i don't know i don't recommend them - my personal experience was really bad
0,ordered a peach half couch arrangement to be delivered on february 13th for my mother's casket  it cost over $200 delivered  she always wanted to be buried in her mother's beautiful peach lace nightgown so i wanted an arrangement to match it  i was stunned to find a bright yellow blue and hot pink arrangement  it looked like a birthday bouquet  i was sooooo disappointed and i cannot recommend this florist
0,a few arrangement from them but they are not very consistent i've have bought $50-$100 arrangement and every year no matter the price or flowers they have been becoming smaller and smaller and not as well put together i will not be repurchasing from them again
0,flowers delivered to my girlfriend for valentine's day she works at a casino and i requested that they be delivered direct and they were delivered to the bell desk instead she was forced to leave her busy work to get the flowers herself the flowers delivered were nothing like what is shown on the website i could have spent half as much from a different florist for the same quality the flowers started to wilt after 1 day very disappointed and will not use again
0,don't know why it's such a hit or miss thing with flowers i ordered a dozen roses from the rose shack for my wife for valentines day they told me they get fresh roses on monday so i figure i'll have them delivered tuesday that way they'll be fresh and she can enjoy them all week however this was not meant to be 130 dollars later and thursday she's already throwing some out i've ordered before and got nice flowers i don't know why it's so inconsistent but i'm done i'll find something else to do on valentines day
0,unaccomodating and expensive  if your kids cannot make it to camp one day of the week they will not allow a makeup day and the price stays the same  they charge a "late fee" if you want to come the same day and don't seem to care whether they turn away new clients or customers because they are more interested in money  gold metal gymnastics in chandler although a bit further is a better option  they are friendly kind and know that with children and our lives things don't always work out exactly as we want  save your money and go to another camp that cares about families and kids and not about nickel and diming you
0,went to the sunday night salsa lessons at paragon there were about 200 people for the salsa group lessons it was a noisy zoo men far outnumbered women but during the course of the lesson it almost evened out lot's of partner switching -- in fact switching is almost all we did that has it's advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners i have certainly heard a lot of hype about paragon but the studio left me kind of cold i don't see how anybody could learn to dance there the quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios i have been to of course maybe the instruction was better than i knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question i gave them another try on a thursday for a west coast swing lesson the quality of instruction wasn't good and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom they have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom i watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what i saw paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners so if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else for meat markets do paragon their prices and quality will appeal to anyone who thinks mcdonald's is a great deal
0,joined fred astaire in 2003 and went for as long as i could afford itthis dance studio is all about high pressure sales i noticed that they really work on the lonely; widowers divorcees etc they make you feel like you are part of their family and when you run out of money drop you like a hot potato i didn't even finish my last few lessons because of the hotcold nonsense everything is very expensive and i know of other customers who went through their life savings just to stay a part of this group because they were lonely it is very sad that people can earn their living taking advantage of othersthe dance instructors are very talented so i gave one star
0,food was absolutely gross i ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado bacon and turkey breast what i got was totally different from the picture first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame) there was no avocado 1 slice of bacon no lettuce and to top it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking lunch meat lol no not the kind that you get from the deli the other sweaty nasty looking stuff gross our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so i would have a bit of an attitude if i had to wait 10 tables without assistance too   the manager was really nice of course that disgusting sandwich that i didn't eat was free
0,service cold food our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted bland food crazy overpriced long waits in the arcade 1 beer per hour maximum  avoid at all costs fair manager
0,place just plain sucksbad management lost them bizdumb arcade drama** they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old
0,the dave and busters in homestead pa last night waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs charged them already too - both incorrectly my brother had to walk around and find out who it was waitress never apologized gm was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out did nothing to remedy the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill after spending over $300 plus games we will never go back whatever happened to the customer is always right horrible service
0,of the games were out of order and i had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits  apathetic service staff all around the peanut and i were really disappointed  won't be back
0,keep it short and sweet: save yourself $100 buy a good board game your alcohol of choice order a pizza and invite your friends over what an incredible disappointment after seeing the enticing commercials so many times we decided to give this place a try on a double date i understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however the food was incredibly over-priced came out cold (as in sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and i literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink it was pure juice $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them (not to mention my glass was dirty and i saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop i know the food and beverage commission would be as disappointed as i was) the service was terrible don't ask for anything from your waiter as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade yes if you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games i suppose i would advise you give it a shot i would never recommend their food customer service or drinks save yourself the money and stay home or go for a traditional bowling figure skating roller-blading rock climbing basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead
0,was here on 103 and i have to say this was a horrible experience  me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards  it took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again  we ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table)  no refill on my beverage no how is your food no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered  lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people  i will not be back again to eat
0,to put this gentlywhile i may go back to pittsburgh some day i will never return to the carnegie museum of art it's not that i mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others i have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and i felt like i was at a bong shop on haight st in sf it comes down to the fact that a docent while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it told the students it was a watchtower "from auschwitz a place where they basically fried a lot of jews"  seriously that's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what i could only guess were middle schoolers it sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint"oh that place they basically just fry eggs"on top of all that the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout east and west germany during hitler's rule (ie not those in auschwitz)in sum docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer and this one sucked so carnegie museums of pittsburgh if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read)
0,this point i am done i scheduled my kids for the last 2 weeks in august and then due to an emergency i had to cancel which i did a month before their camp was to start i was told they were issuing my refund and that was 3 weeks ago three weeks and i still dont have it i live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up its just sooo unprofessional and annoying they need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner 7-10 business days are fine but 3 weeks is unacceptable for it to not have even been mailed yet so dissapointed and will never use them again
0,response to the response i received from the museum rep i called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet but you reponded on yelp this week is the 3rd week your response stated that my refund was sent this week if you are speaking about this current week today is the 14th monday and the week has just begun if you are talking about last week can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on yelp thank you

0, another losing season  wtf man weren't we in first place at the all-star break  what happened  i wasn't expecting a world series champ or even a pennant winner  but was a winning season too much to ask for  this marks the 20th anniversary since the pirates' last winning season  that's right folks--it's been since 1992  let's take a look at the world of 1992baseball:  the pirates' roster that year included stan belinda doug drabek zane smith denny neagle jay bell orlando merced andy van slyke and of course barry bonds  all have since retired  the only new ballparks were new comiskey park (now us cellular field) and camden yards  no stadiums had corporate names  the arizona diamondbacks the colorado rockies the miami marlins and the tampa bay (devil) rays didn't exist  the washington nationals were the montreal expos  the milwaukee brewers were in the al  both the nl and the al only had two divisions each  the minor league washington wild things didn't exist either and nor did their league  kbl was the big cable sports channeltv:  "saturday night live's" cast included dana carvey ellen cleghorne chris farley tim meadows mike myers kevin nealon phil hartman  chris rock adam sandler rob schneider and david spade  "seinfeld" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew kramer's first name  monday nights on nbc included "murphy brown" "evening shade" and " northern exposure"movies:  the top movies included "lethal weapon 3" "basic instinct" "hone alone 2" "the bodyguard" and "aladdin"  when you wanted to watch movies at home you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on vhs tapes or laserdiscs  music:  bruce springsteen released "lucky town" and "human touch"  on the same day  rem had "automatic for the people"  gin blossoms released their first album "new miserable experience" which stayed on the charts for almost two years  bare naked ladies "gordon" featured the cult classic "if i had a million dollars"  you either listened to albums on cassette or cd and you bought them at record stores like national record mart  doug hopkins (gin blossoms) kurt cobain (nirvana) shannon hoon (bline melon) and jerry garcia (grateful dead) were all alivetechnology:  few people had internet access  you also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone  you watched movies on a vcr  you met up with your friends without texting them  you ordered merchandise by "sending in" or by calling an "800" number  you had to buy tickets by waiting in line  and oj simpson was still a football heroso that's it pittsburgh pirates  i feel like telling you i'm done with you guys  i'm no fair weather fan but 20+ years of losing is enough
0,reading all the reviews here about c-fu gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley i am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the areawas the service rude and uncaring the answer here is yes  especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of  but all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good  however the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food dishes that made me ashamed to be chinese (yes the level that c-fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):-  fried glutinous rice:  the preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was mia we complained to one of the waiters who replied that "they probably forgot" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better)  more over the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)here the c-fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil   -  glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf  just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leafdishes i was amazed by (and no not in a good way):-  deep fried taro dumpling:  have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil-  steamed bok choy:  how the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable  c-fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetableunbelievableon a good note the siu mai was decent  we did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop upbut nope that was itso if  you must go to c-fu for dim-sumjust order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes  dinner here was much better 1 star is for dim-sum onlynext time i have a dim-sum craving you'll be finding me across the valley at china chan's (glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows  that's where i'll be sticking to from now on
0,where did the screaming yellow  "we reserve the right to add 15% gratuity to your bill" signs go  aka we know the service and dimsum sux so we'll try and make money another way  best dimsum in phoenix (pretty low standards for a desert community i guess)  luckily there's plenty of competition now in the east valley (hint: go 1 mi east 1 mile  south) nw corner get there before 11am on weekends or stand in line with the rest of the other asians
0,husband and i both got sick after eating here  how come there is always a line on the weekend
0,place is used to be my favorite dim sum restaurant but i have not visited them for a while it's not because of their foods their foods is good and service is ok it's their sneaky behavior at the register that bothers me i don't know if they are still doing the same thing but i just got pissed of once for all here is the story i was at the cashier desk to pay my bill the lady at the counter did not know i can understand cantonese so the lady told customer who is a friend of her that the 15% tips is already included in the credit card receipt as total so there is no need to put tips in the blank tip line what a shocking finding if you don't calculate your total bill you may be paying double tips what a shame on them i don't mind to pay 20% tips but they should told their customer that the total number on your receipt already includes tipsi have not visited the restaurant since
0,place is so awful that i don't even want to spend too much time writing this reviewfood is mediocre service was extremely rude my catering order was never filled and when i called to confirm the order one hour prior to pickup they just simply told me they didn't make it and wasn't planning on doing ithuh  i once found a cooked cockroach in my dim sum dishthat was itwould never ever go back
0,i can say is yuk and thats not a chinese  for terrible this is probley the most disgusting dim sum  ever  alot of deep fried dishes the place had a nasty stinge when i walked in on a high note the staff was quite friendly they better be for the foodand i use the term loosley they are serving
0,came here for dimsum with a few friends during lunch the quality of the food is mediocre compared the legit ones in hacienta heights ca or san gabriel ca my friend and i are hardcore dimsum fans so we have been to this dimsum a few times until we decided to change to the one across the street called phoenix palace buffet for some reason we returned back to c-fu to try it again but the service was horrible we requested water and tea and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer i had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup i immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out they did not do anything to compensate for such a gross encounter which in the end made everyone at the table lose our appetites seriously traumatized definitely not coming back until their service improves
0,decided to check this place out after having driven by it numerous times and had a few friend say that they liked the place a fair deal  i was hungry and craving chinese so why not i figuredcalled in to see if they were open and they were but hearing that they had an hour wait i elected to carry out  15-20 minutes is about average so i didn't say boo  25 minute prep time isn't too far outside of the estimate and they were busy after allthe barbecue pork lo-mein was not the best ever  pork had a fatty texture and the dish as a whole was okay though a bit bland  the duck won ton soup was pretty goodright until i got to the meat  almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it  i am not sure if that is a normal part of how it's made but i have never experienced the like before and it was a put offthe experience over the phone and waiting was fair  the place was packed due to being one of the rare places open christmas night  and i understand the pressure of being a host or hostess in this situation but i saw this girl loose her composure a few times in the 15 minutes i was there once pretty majorlywith the bones fatty flavor and other worries i managed a few bites overall before my $20 meal went into the garbage disposal or trash  i'm stunned with the overwhelming good reviews as my experience was so weak as i had pretty much a poor experience overall and a lot of disappointmenti may or may not give them another shot in the future  at the moment i doubt it
0,don't ever eat dim sum over here  food was not fresh at all i wouldn't be surprised if they just microwave leftovers from the previous day and serve them all over again their shrimp balls tasted like poop balls okay so maybe i'm over-exaggerating a little but you get the idea it actually tasted like effing plastic ewwwwwai say go right over to phoenix palace buffet across the street and get yourself some edible dim sum you can thank me later :)
0,on weekdays if you want dim sumthe last two times i went there i left after sitting at a table for 20 minutes with no food sometimes a cart would go by - a different table  no amount of hand waving or imploring looks would do any goodyou couldn't drag me in there kicking and screaming on a weekday again
0,used to come to this place a lot when we were still living in vegas  we were on vacation in vegas recently and figured "let's visit our old stomping restaurant"  we were greeted and paid first (new policy) i guess there were a lot of people that just gets up from their table and pretends to be using the restroom but actually leaving anyways not a big dealmy hubby goes and gets some rice and what did he find in there hairhe told one of the workers and the worker quickly took the pot and said thank you  so it's a good thing that she acknowledged  ok so we thought it was over  i go up to their fresh vegetable stir-fry area where the guy does it in front of you  i picked my veggies (bean sprouts etc) and shrimp and handed it to himwent and grabbed some of the food and headed back to him to pick up my stir-fried veggies and headed back to my table to enjoy this food  i have been craving for this veggies all dayi'm about to dig in and what do i find hair again  is it booby trap day for us  i took it to the guy and he said it's from the bean sproutsi said no it's not and i actually picked it up with my fork and showed him  he didn't apologize but asks me if i wanted another onei don't think so after all this happened we kind of lost our appetite but we paid $50 for our freaking dinner  so we were just careful of what we were putting in our mouth sigh  while we were having dinner my son had to go to restroom so hubby took him while they were in there one of the workers came in to use the restroom he went pee and blew his nose in his hands and just rinsed his finger tips off and leftthat is freaking gross  by this time we've had itso we just leftnever ever coming back to this place again
0,stars place is disgusting found a wormcatapillar in the kim chi didnt give us a refund gross dont go there for any of the food it's so dirty so dirty so rude so cheap signs everywhere about extra charges
0,can't quite understand why so many people like buffet at asia my wife and i tried the rainbow location a year or so ago and it was absolutely revolting the serving areas were messy the food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-endperhaps i am picky because i come from australia where we can get amazing chinese food (sort of like how in the us you can get great mexican due to the proximity to mexico) the fact that i don't eat fish or seafood of any kind didn't help either - the place was very heavy on the seafood  vegetarians won't he happy either unless you are one of those fake "vegetarians" that thinks fish are vegetablesthe final nail in the coffin for us about this place where the signs on the walls saying that due to wastage if you left any food on your plate you would be charged extra for it i mean -really- part of the beauty of a buffet is that you get to own the food and decide what to eat i don't want to have to clean up my plate for fear of trouble with the management i'd be interested to know if this ludicrous policy is still in place but i have no desire to ever eat here again and will never know
0,put if you can't afford to eat at nice buffet and wish to enjoy crab this is the place othewise skip this place since the crab tasted like mash potatos and all though they don't run out of food the customers grab all they can get as soon as they bring the crab or lobster outfood tasted like 2nd or 3rd day left overs and hate to say it i tend to give great reviews to places that i enjoy and this is not one of them my friend that took me there keep telling me that the food is great for the price and i was thinking well i guess if you are hungry enough you can eat out of garbage cans and the cost would be great alsoi would not return to this place to eat because i rather eat white rice by itself then the food they servesorry for the bad review i'm sure there are tons of people that enjoy the value but once you know what food supposed to taste like it's hard to go back to this type of buffet
0,place is just "okay" my dad loves this place or used to love it honestly the only reason why i go to this place is because of their shrimp and mussels oh and their free refills of thai iced tea that's it it's good but everything else is pure nasty-ness unless of course you're into the taste of shitanyway i hate their servers here with a passion especially the hostess the last and final time my family and i were there we brought in fam members from new york so in total there were around nine of us the hostess wanted us to fit in one booth one freaking booth how do you expect all nine of us to fit into one booth when we kindly asked if we could have at least two she rolled her eyes at us gave us attitude and finally gave in after arguing with my dad my dad of course went to go complain at the front she started arguing with my dad and finally my dad gave in and yelled "shut up i'm the customer and you're not" dumb hoe finally shut her mouth there are plenty of events like this in the past i swear i've never came across such rude and disrespectful people in my whole entire life they're also pretty slow on refills just a fyi
0,proceed at your own discretion may suffer from ptsd after eating at this particular buffet
0,finally decided to try this place after passing it a billion times on the way home it was right down the street from me it looked decent and the parking lot was always full so i said why not boy was that a big mistake i went at lunch around 12:30 - 1 so you would think being a buffet the food would be fresh seeing that it was busy big time yucko the food was dry and hard i thought i was going to break a tooth eating their orange chicken then i tried their beef and broccoli thinking it would be better because it wasn't dry wrong again ewww so nasty fried rice and crab rangoons were also disappointing i would never eat here again please do not eat here unless your a fan of: *nasty food that's dried up and taste like dog food *dirty surroundings and eating next to strangers *racing to the buffet against other customers just to get some food
0,stars for this place this use to be one of mine and best friend's spot to eat on one of our regular trips (we love the crab legs) needless to say the eyeball on my crab was still there looking at me and my friend found what looked to be a nose hair in her won ton soup we both left in a hurry and made sure no one saw us because we still had full plates of food and were afraid to be charged extra we proceeded to throw up in front of the restaurant never again we are very sadden by the fact that one of our favorite spots is ruined for us
0,been to this buffet for years i pretty much grew up eating here this place definitely deserves its 3 stars; however i just had the worst experience after years of eating here i'm not entirely sure if the management has changed throughout the years but whoever hired these waiters and the grill master must not have taken their applications seriously my first bad experience happened the second i was seated the waiter rolled his eyes at my party members for taking a little while on deciding what they wanted to drink he was paying so little attention to us that he even got 2 out of 6 drinks wrongsecond i remembered how much i used to love making my own mongolian barbeque because of how friendly the old grill master used to be however not quite this time i had to call him twice just to get his attention and he definitely ignored me both times because after the third time i asked him to make my order spicy he told me to go and grab the sauce myself sorry grill master but no tip for you this timelastly the same waiter that made a fuss about getting my drinks was taking my plates away this time this guy manages to spill all the pot sticker sauce all over my table and on my girlfriend's seat while she was gone the guy never apologized and just simply up and left our table in a messneedless to say i didn't tip these bastards one cent for their horrid service i would've been better off getting my own drink and making my own barbeque like i said this place probably deserves its 3 stars from years of eating here but never again will i be visiting buffet  asia
0,just move here from san francisco a month ago so my wife and i usually find some buffet places to try since it's a rare in sf today we hit buffet  asia yes you can blame me for being brave after reading all the one star reviews lol to make this review short i will not ever look at this place again even when passing by
0,i used to believe 'bad dim sum' was an old wives tale ment to scare children from the greasy steamed dishes of utter omgwtfbbqpwnage-ness thank you cathay house for industrializing dim sum and making it as chinese as taco bell is to mexican foodlately in my review i've been doing a breakdown of everything from how the place looks to me to listing what i ordered and what i thought of it i'd rather not for this review because it would force me to stop lean over and vomit uncontrollably gripes- they sat us in what i call the 'shit hole' section of the restaurant where small families less then a few people and generally those who don't look like they're gonna spend a lot of money go to minimize chances of customers wasting their time and maximize profit guess where the white people sat- same cart different pusher to give the illusion they were well stocked- you could taste how much effort they put into their food i've had chicken mcnuggets that have had more effort put into them-oh look another cart that means they got more selectiondamn it those two just tradeddamn youconclusionif you feel like dim sum go somewhere elseif you feel like eating what chinese people make to sell to foreigners by all means go here and order an egg foo young and general tso's chicken and taste that authentic chinese goodness
0,here for dinner and the place is pretty dead the food was nothing speciali've had tastier authentic chinese cousine would not waste my money here again there are better chinese restaurant on the same street that you don't have too look far
0,horriblethe worst dim sum i have ever had
0,wait was almost as bad at the food i felt so cheated after waiting to be seated just to eat this well below standard dim sum
0,frequent 2 other dim sum restaurants in las vegas and decided to give cathay house a try yesterday because they had zagat stickers on their door the food was absolutely horrible overall i was with 4 other people and no one had a good experience a lot of the dishes were cold and some looked and tasted like they were reheated leftovers from another day the egg custard tasted like old frying oil was used to make it and completely unedible when we told the manager how bad the egg custard was he didn't even apologize he even acted annoyed that we said anything i would never go back there again orchid garden and chang's have much better food and service
0,this place is horrid i've never even reviewed a place so low before i'm really disappointed vegasso this has got to be the worst dim sum restaurant i've been too with food and service usually service is horrible at dim sum because its dim sum they feel the need that they don't need to check up on you because they have the little ladies with carts going around and around serving you what you choose which isn't that badbut this place as soon as we got seated they brought out our water in plastic disposable cups when everyone else had regular re- used washable cups how do you run out of cups very classy for a "nice" restaurant and we had also got tea chrysanthemum tea as i poured it into my tea cup i looked in and saw that a bug came out of the pot it was disgusting we couldn't even get anyones attention to change it out or for them to take it awayalso our soy sauce bottle was empty they didn't even notice to give us a new one we had to switch it out with the table next to usand at last the food it was cold dim sum is suppose to be hot steaming hot but it was so cold it was breaking apart horrible i tell you
0,hate to give bad reviews but this place was definitely not goodthe food here wasn't very flavorful and i'm not super picky on flavor the chicken looked and tasted like it maybe wasn't chicken there was a fish tank full of dead fish on display for the diners to see gross there's millions of places to get chinese food in chinatown so i would not recommend this one also i got sick to my stomach almost instantly after we finished eating i usually prefer food that doesn't make me sick
0,i could give them a 'no star' rating i would  worst service ever  i've been to numerous dim sum places around town but have never been passed up and ignored so much in my life  never going there againgo to orchid garden on sahara do it
0,worst service i've ever had and i've been to a lot of chinese restaurants all the other times i've been here nothing worth mentioning but the most recent time will be my last timenow i don't know who all the titles of the staff so i'll just refer to them as waiters and busers i think we had 2 servers and 2-3 busers throughout the course of our meal2-3 because i think i saw two busers that looks identical and i'm not being racist because i'm chinese myself so i'll just count them both as one personwe first get there and put in our order i didn't keep track of time but probably after 20-30 minutes we get our appetizer still no soup though and that's supposed to come first  buser 1 delivers the appetizer but practically drops the dish on the table with a loud thud and immediately walks away about 10-20 minutes later the other dishes started coming the worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak the thing about this dish is when it comes to your table the steak is supposed to be sizzling in the metal tray in our case it came out at room temperature (meat and metal pan) so as you can expect absolutely no sizzlesometime throughout the meal we asked buser 1 if we're supposed to get soup he responds by saying don't ask him ask the waiter so we ask one of the waiters and he apologizes and says he'll get us soup about 10 minutes later we still haven't received the soup so we don't really bother anymore the waiter walks by and asks if we have received our soup yet which we said not yet and he could tell by the lack of soup bowls he immediately gets someone (again) to bring out soup this time buser 2 puts the bowl of soup down not sure where his mind is at but drops the soup spoon into the bowl and splashes all of us with soup my mom suffering the most splash damage he says sorry once but for an incident like that i think you should be more apologeticafter a few more dishes arrive we ask for rice which is not something that you should need to do yourself at a chinese restaurantfinally when we're done eating we ask buser 1 for some to-go boxes he goes and brings back boxes and before he walks away says "ask someone else to do it" wtf kind of attitude is thatin the end they had the audacity to charge us 18% gratuity on a party of 4 with dreadful service overall the food was decent but it was painful to eat with that degree of service
0,for dimsum only]i'm sure you've needed to buy a car - a brand-spanking-new one or a semi-whored-out-used version - at one point in your life and have experienced a nagging-dying-to-complete-a-sale-to-take-out-a-chick-salesperson it wasn't the greatest of experiences rightwell meet the dimsum versioni really wonder if these ladies work here on a full commission basis or have been set strict asian quotas (those having worked overseas or know someone who does may have learnt at some point how some retail outlets staff actually have daily quotas to meetor else adios bish) they sure fly around in their dimsum carts like the establishment is a go-cart-trackand pushing for sales a lot more aggressively than i would say a carsalesperson would at the end of the monthbest part the moment they knew i spoke chinesethey went gung-ho-you-need-more-meat-on-you-son-"youtooskinnnnnnnnnnnnny" on me (bish pleaseyou look anoxeric maybe) well they still wonsince i tend to be a pushover with asian-aunties-battling-menopause and their dimsum cartsand found my small table for 2 with food for at least 5 gargantuan eatersyet this place which was recommended by locals (asian ladies that you'd find working at the hotels and casinos that i randomly started conversations with to ask for tips on local food joints) isn't that great (i think i got trolled)oilier dimsumbelow average quality (just seems like the food sat out a little too long as well as tasting rather bland)and isn't piping hotmehbut what really killed it for me was this ever present sour taste that wasn't vinegarand if you know your dimsum (or even any other food in general)this isn't a good sign maybe the health department might have to come over for an (s)inspectionbefore as comedian russel peters imitates his dad "somebody gonna get a hurt real bad"if you're craving dimsum i'd sayjust wait until you get out of vegas and hit a real spot instead and if you have to be here please don't order the dimsum but order ala carte dishes instead - at least if the food isn't that fresh the raging fire under the wok will fudgingly kill everything in itit may just save you a trip to the porcelain throne of shame (don't ask)
0,ever come here  should've known better than to stay and try the food  after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server (the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal); it took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water  service was very slow (the noodles arrived first and that was half an hour or more after we arrived); our server was surly almost to the point of rudeness; and my nephew and i even checked out the aquarium there-- it was almost void of live fish (maybe one swimming) w dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water  nasty  but (and there's always a "but" in these kinds of reviews isn't there) we were starving next time i will insist on going somewhere else especially when there are many signs telling us to  (funnily enough the restroom here wasn't that bad  i'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here so the restrooms aren't used much  lol)total bill was just under $50 w minimal tip  food included about six dim sum plates a beef stir-fry lo mein noodles tea and water  the only item all of us liked here (mom sister my nephew and me) were the noodles  the beef stir-fry was the only thing i thought was palatable w some of the meat tougher than the others  (don't even get me started on the dim sum fillings) i'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone  i wouldn't be surprised to hear this place closing down very soon if it isn't already what a horrible experience  :(
0,worse service
0,went in with a lot of expectations considering the great reviews on yelp - and we were starved - so we would liked the food if it even remotely good the place -  the restaurant had a strong smell that was not pleasing to say the leastthe service - bad they were running a vaccumm cleaner while we were having our mealte food: horrible - it had no taste - we ordered a noodle soup and a veg main course the noodle soup tasted like boiled water with noodlesi've been to shanghai and i know this was neither authentic nor good
0,this is what happens when you open the only dim sum restaurant in the dessert utter chaosdim sum normally has large quantities of selection of food constantly moving around the restaurant in carts you see what you like you pick it you eat it portions are small so price is decentthe quality of food here was terrible but come on you say this is fracking phoenix what did you expect fine fine fine i'll stomach cold dim sum that was suppose to be hot chewy meat instead of tender and bland instead of flavorfulthe place is a dump and the line is 40 minutes long well it is the only dim sum place no the chaos though that is inside is what get's the place a 1 star first off i don't even see how this place is setup for dim sum the tables are arranged in a maze like formations where the carts can't even get to youforget the fact that the carts can't reach you most patrons got up and chased them down and brought back their own food in the end we didn't even get most of what we wanted cuz they sold out one of the employees shrugged his shoulders and told us next time to chase down we want to get instead of waiting totally not worth the wait especially since the food quality was terrible
0,i'm afraid i cannot give a fair review we arrived shortly after 8 pm and there were slim pickin's left on the buffet and they weren't in any hurry to put fresh food out what little food i did try was ok will have to give it another shot at an earlier time i evening i guess very disappointed this time around
0,is very very poor we waited 25mins for dimsum i asked for shrimp and pork dimsum lady said " i only have chicken feetwtf [ y dont u get more commonsense] we ended up getting fried noodles forget about this place i highly recommend c fu restaurant in chandler this place suck more than 50 people inside and they ony have one dimsum cart running
0,different experience the second time around the second time reveals a disturbing issue well this is absolutely disappointing to write especially after writing a favorable review of great wall the first time around but our experience here was not good during our last visitfirst we were not acknowledged when we came in the door we had to pardon an employee (who appeared to be doing nothing) to take us in he then proceeded to take us to a booth after we requested a table and chairs we asked again to be seated at a table and chairs and he finally obliged we were given menus and that's when the real trouble began in terms of service first we ordered a lot of food 2 main dishes 2 appetizers 2 drinks and an extra side dish to split it was my last night in phoenix so i wanted to go all out and sample some different things besides we have the money so who cares right well the drinks came and when we ordered the server let us know there were no bbq pork ribs but didn't offer an alternative when i picked something else he rolled his eyes and said "so you really want pork" yes i do so we waited for our appetizers only one of which came out before the main dishes the others came out with the dinners now the food was good i have no complaints there but when the person bringing us the food came out she would't even look at us the feeling i was getting was that they were either disgusted with our presence or just didn't care to talk to their non-asian customers i say that because the servers were "chatting up" the chinese folks at their tables (it wasn't a busy night only a few small families) but they were literally ignoring us and a hispanic family sitting adjacent to us i wouldn't normally write about that but it was so egregious i have to say how it appeared to look i wish i could say it had something to do with language barriers and being comfortable with your native tongue maybe but they spoke english fine from what i saw and it just didn't feel good to be ignored anyway no refills on tea water or our main drinks were given when we were done we were ignored for 20 minutes until i glared at another server who was having banter with an asian couple near us i guess he told our server to bring us a check so we pull out the amex and what do you know for the first time all night our server immediately comes over and says in perfect english "we don't take american express" (even though the tray the bill was on says "amex preferred" but that's neither here nor therewow once it was time to pay he's on my shoulder like a parrot prior to that he wanted nothing to do with us finally the woman who came out to put the food in 'to-go' bags literally ignored us even after i smiled and tried to talk to her she turned her head away when my date tried to thank her for putting everything in bags for us and our sending off waiting another 10 minutes for someone to come take the card before giving up and walking to front and giving the bill to someone who appeared to be a manager no tip given you've got to be kidding me in the end this experience wrecked what was supposed to be my new chinese food place the service ruined what was great food the feeling i got while there was that they didn't particularly care if we (non-chinese customers) were there and that is really sad needless to say we won't be coming back
0,went here today to have dim sum with my friend and it was end up uncomfortable we sit there for 15' and nobody came to ask anythings after the foods were brought out we asked 3 waitresses for the sauce and had nothing then i asked the waiter again and he brought it w unhappy face and through the dish in front of us we order 5 dishes but they brought out only four when we finished and checked out one of them told me we still have shrimp ball is making and that was 45' after we ordered it i didnt want it anymore when i paid i didnt put the tip in my card and he came to our table to check if we put the tip on the table what the heck should i leave the tip for the service we had
0,lunch dim sum was greasy almost all pork and limited to one cart and a dessert cartservice was slow and not very pleasant i would never go back for the food spring rolls fried to a crisp belong in a bad fast food restaurant 
0,special the mekong palace still better but this is my second dim sum still looking
0,been here before with some friends we stopped in here to grab a few baskets of dim sum it was lunch time and there were a lot of people in the restaurant but only 3 trolleys roaming around over and over again one trolley was jook with chinese donut the other two were dim sum items well the dim sum wasn't all that great it was mediocre at best we had 4 baskets and the total came to slightly over $11 before tip the tripe was flavorless the stuffed bean curd sheets were okay har gow were below average leaving the cha siu bao being the only thing passable one of the servers came over and asked if we wanted to order some food i asked hubby and he asked for the check the woman then asked me in cantonese if the food wasn't to my liking i thought "ya think" but then didn't really verbalize it why be nasty but we'll never come back again on future trips
0,place is expensive and not even good its really busy but i prefer not to eat at this place because of the price for 3 people it came out to like 48 dollars or something wth no way thirty something i could have dealt with but 48 i kno that wasnt worth $48portions are small the food isnt bad but not worth it
0,on yelpers' opinions tried to order some take out we did not like the food period they couldn't even make simple food rating of zero is not available
0,you ever want to try a new restaurant that was rated pretty well and found out that you should whip out the ol' blackberry and log onto the site just to heave the thing across the room in the hopes of watching the communicative device shatter into a glorious spectacle of plastic and debris well this was the case in the following review i'm about to "drop" on you the wife read about chang's hong kong cuisine that a "yelper" had reviewed we were planning a trip to vegas and figured that we would try something different as opposed to the usual buffets that we would normally head straight for innocently enough we made a b-line straight to chang's once we arrived in vegas and was anticipating a decent dim sum experience once we got there we were left standing in the foyer for a few minutes during this time i noticed that one of the servers arrived late from behind us and hadn't had the chance to clock in before she sat us i just found that kinda funny and thought i would share this with you ) as the brunch progressed the wife got really tiffed because the best chinese team in terms of timing and follow-through in the dim sum industry decided that they would all take the day off and allow the lack-luster slow and incompetent crew work a solid day whoa is me service was slow our tea order was really late the food was sub-par and most of all my hot chili sauce was late i loves me some hot chili sauce with my dim sum dumplinsi think that the highlight of our experience was when my wife finally threw in the towel and flagged down a chinese lady and berated her with god knows what i couldn't tell you what she said but service surely improved from that point on god i love feisty chinese women the dim sum itself was not memorable and the chicken feet were like the worst things because it tasted breaded before braising  it felt and tasted gummy  the prices were great and its location was easy to find it wasn't tucked in the corner of some sleezy shopping plaza that may be impossible to get into or out--to the final note from me is that all in all i will not go out of my way to come back here i think the only way i would is if a friend clocked me over the head with a baseball bat (preferably metalmy head might shatter a wooden one then i'll be left cleaning the bits of splintered wood from the carpet with a headache who wants that) and bribe the paramedics to drop us off here rather than the hospital maybe this way i wouldn't mind the mediocre tasting food but i'd probably bleed out before i get my chili sauce (
0,use this restaurant for your wedding reception or any special banquet  they so nice at the beginning but they so rued and try to make money after you deposit i had no way to get out because my date already set the invitation already sent so i get stuck with them service so bad i am so embarrassing with my guessand so sorry to choose this restaurant
0,stars are you fucking kidding me come on vegas step your dim sum game up three words to describe the waitresses:loud rude obnoxious food is mediocre i'd say below average compared to 626 sd or even irvine so if you've had any of the above this place will disappoint  and definitely annoy the shit out of you the heat alone made me 289347x irritable than usual so imagine that plus the waitresses' incompetency
0,91910 my family (6 adults 4 children (5yrs & under) went to enjoy dim sum at what was our favorite restaurant we i reviewed the bill i noticed an unfamiliar high-priced amount on the bill i went to the cashier station and asked what was the charge for i was told it is a service charge for parties over 8 people i said "there are only 6 adults and 4 children" he (i believe the owner) just shrouded his shoulders and said "that's our service charge" $1925 - that's an extreme charge for servicing water refills and collecting empty dim sum containers sunday dim sum  chang's is now a thing of the past for usping pang pong here we come
0,dim sum ever  no one speaks english and no carts were coming around  we just walked out after two dishes  i will never be back
0,couldnt agree more with steve n this place is pretty horrible it's like they bought dim sum from ca brought it over froze it and now reheating to serve to us it's hard tastless and definitely mehhhhhh i quote steve n " more like dimshit"
0,says that this place is better than the sgv dim sum restaurants must be trully stupid or get their head bang in the shower this place is horrendous if you see the color of the chicken feet you  know that its not going to taste good the rest of the food seems cooked too long and the service is slowi mean i understand when you go to chinese restaurant you expect the service to suck ass cos thats the way they operate but when you have the owner operating as cashier that tell the customer to pay upfront then you should just open a to go counter instead of a full dining restaurantif you dont know how to open a full seating restaurant go slow open a little to go place first
0,sum here is terrible  charlotte does not have enough competition for dim sum  i used to live in atlanta  i enjoyed the dim sum houses there  i grade dim houses with a curve in charlotte  i am not expecting them to be as good as atlanta  even with a curve the dim sum is terrible     i went on a weekend  many of the dumplings were obviously frozen and not fresh  dim sum was very heavy as well  i only ordered steam items and a few pan fried items  however i had a real full stomach  i was not feeling good at all  i did not even eat much  the dim sum was flavorless and greasy   if you live in charlotte go to china delight in atlanta to get good dim sum
0,would be better off going to a asian store and buying frozen dim sum price was ridiculous for dim sum and the area and quality totally not worth going was very disappointed  i have had plenty of dim sum all over the country would not recommend this to anyone who knows dim sum
0,not get the spare ribs with black bean sauce unless you are more adventurousinsane it was a gelatinous surprise i wasn't sure what part of the animal i was really eating it did not come out in rib form it was all hacked and thrown together it was honestly ghastly i tried a bite nope but still politely paid for it o the quiet dissonance google image spare ribs yeah i thought it would at least resemble that-obviously smaller- with a different sauce *after re googling "chinese spare ribs" i am a bit alarmed at how different my dish was from all of the images that showed up the sauce was described as black bean but came out clear and mucus like black bean was a really misleading imagethe glass they brought my drink in was not clean i mean it was really not clean  skinlip gloss lip residue i asked if i could have a drink in a can and they just brought me the same drink in another glassthe chicken and pork steamed buns here had a mold looking residue on the paper beneath them i still ate it for some reason over compensating here service was ok the sanitation score is 885i got some lo meinchicken dish to go and the entire time i was convinced the chicken they used was uterus it was in these weird long thin strips that sort of curled they had these strange indentations all through out one side of the chicken i feel like a jerk writing this but what is that meat throw some white chicken breast in that instead and it would be wonderful the noodles were wonderful the meat was sketchy yet i still ate itthis seems to be a neighborhood favorite place for some reason
0,would give this 0 star if i can we went in sunday to start our day with some dim sums since they are the freshest on sunday and they actually roll the dim sum in cartswhen we walked in i can see they are very busy and there's 3 pplz in front of us the front lady asked us how many after i told her 2 she just walk off seating a guy in front of us she came back and start seating these 2 pplz came after us and then another lady came to ask how many we have while i was telling her 2 pplz the previous walked back and seat these 4 pplz just walk inso i asked her is there supposed to be a line she was like no they seat according to table i was like i understand if the table fit 10 then u don't want to use it for 2 pplz however if the table fit 4 i expected to be seat before other pplz that just walk inthe dim sum is not the best but it'll do for charlotte it's just that lady just ruined my whole mood to eat there so we walk out and decided to try krazy fish down the roadprobably will not go back for a long while
0,obviously i'm one of those people who doesn't learn from their mistakes  this time instead of going into the restaurant for dim sum we ordered chinese takeout  the soups were meh  neither the wonton nor the hot and sour soup had much flavor  next came the entrees  for our family dinner night we ordered sesame chicken orange chicken and sweet & sour chicken entrees  neither of the kids cared much for the sweet & sour chicken  they said it "tasted funny"  they didn't even want to put on the sweet sticky red sauce that came in a big container on the side  and what kid doesn't love that  that's never been an issue before  my partner had the orange chicken which looked and tasted like chicken covered in the exact same red sweet & sour sauce  he too was not thrilled  mine was the sesame chicken  it too came in what looked like the exact same red sweet & sour sauce with a few (a very few) sesame seeds sprinkled on top  i've never had sesame chicken that wasn't in a flavorful brown sauce and covered in sesame seeds  mine too was practically flavorless  the accompanying rice they gave us was pretty dry and sticky  lastly there were no fortune cookies to finish off a below-average meal  to top it all off the restaurant had apparently significantly raised the prices on everything since the last take-out menu we had on hand  so when picking up the order we paid more than expected and the quality was practically non-existent  dim sum is off our list forever for both take-out and dine-in  as our once-president once said "fool me once shame on  shame on you fool me you can't get fooled again"
0,drove all the way from raleigh (3 hour drive) to eat at this place we came at 9:00pm thirty minutes before closing there were quite a few customers in there at the time as we walked in an older lady shouted we are closed to us and shoo-ing us out the door we were all upset and about to leave then she throws a paper at us telling us hurry up and order standing there rushing us saying come on hurry up and order we did not drive all the way to charlotte for this kind of service so we left and didn't even get to eat we did not appreciate being rushed and forced to order something quickly especially if it's our first time here
0,here with some friends and experienced sub-par food and terrible service first of all the food came out really slow for a mid afternoon lunch and hardly any customers second there was a really long hair coiled around a fried dumpling just under the skin and was clearly visible from the outside i called over the waitress to bring it to her attention and she simply grabbed the plate and left there was no apology or acknowledgement of the tainted food we weren't sure if she was going to bring us a new batch or comp the charge so we just ended up waiting for an eternity before she came backshe brought three new dumplings but my group was too disgusted with the food and the service to even look at them we asked for the check and another lady (i assume a manager) came to speak with us she asked us if everything was okay and if there were any problems she made it seem like the hair incident hadn't been brought to her attention so i mentioned that there was a hair in our food she rudely answered that she already knew this sowhy did you ask us if we had any problems if you already knew about the issue nevertheless she gave us a thoughtless mechanical apology and comped us for only one of the two orders of dumplings even though we didn't eat either of the ordersall in all i was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation and i will definitely not be back
0,went  on sunday with my son i arrived about 11:25 there were three group ahead of us no problem they have you sign in yourself on the back of take out menu and stand around the registerfront doorafter 20 minutes the groups were seated so we were next about then  a couple came in and signed in then in minutes they were seated ahead us  so after standing for 25 minutes we left i called and told them they needed a better system like a maybe they write the name or  give you a number disappointing
0,think i made a terrible mistake and ordered americanized -chinese food from a dim sum restaurant  we ordered two extra-crispy general tso's chicken with added rice (one white one fried) and an egg roll they do not serve combos here so our two entrees came to about $23 there was a lot of food - but it was a little pricier than some of the other fast food chinese take-out places i don't mind paying extra if it's tasty- and it really wasn't that much more in terms of price it was hands down the worst chinese i have ever tasted the rice had a rancid flavor - it smelled and tasted quite bad so my husband graciously offered his white rice to me the base of fried rice is white rice so i doubt it was the rice itself but whatever they put in it was not appetizing the chicken was soggy sugary-sweet (tasted like a very spicey sweet and sour sauce it was even bright red in color) it didn't taste like any general tso's i have tasted before i barely ate my dinner and because it was take-out i wasn't able to give management a chance to fix it unfortunately there were a couple of highlights the staff went the extra step to attempt to keep the crispy texture and did not sauce the chicken until we picked up our dinners which was very thoughtful of her they also have a really delicious homemade eggroll it was oily but you know what it had actual meat and veggies inside of it and that made me happy overall i just can't bring myself to come back for take-out but i was told the dim sum on sundays is delicious so i may give that a shot in six months once i forget about that rice that will haunt my dreams
0,food was horrible the service was worse the woman with dyed short hair acting as hostess is mean n rude can't believe i actually spent money there won't go bk as long as i am breathin
0,believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago to be honest i don't go there any more for few reasons 1 the owner has changed2 the foods quality has changed3 service is not as good as it used to be 4 the original chief seem to be long gone 5 found a better places to have the best dim sum in chandler azonce very satisfied customer is no longer their customer if you want real good chinese foods and restaurant services go somewhere else i guess i will never know how good their foods now don't even want to try
0,place has become really bad since the owners changed recently the dim sum beef which used to be great has become rubbery and the pork has lost all its flavor we used to enjoy this place before but now on a recent weekend visit we saw only about a quarter of the tables occupied after the dim sum lunch we figured out why the dirty place and rude waitresses were tolerable because of the good food not anymore when cold tough meat is served
0,tried this because it got good reviews so we ordered to pick up got the food back home and each container had a ton of watery grease the egg rolls were also full of grease and the taste wasn't that great either i felt like i could have gotten better food at panda express one of the four people ended up with stomach problems the next day the price was cheap but so was the food i was expecting so much more
0,of the most aggravating restaurants i have been to in awhile my partner and i were so irritated that we both got into an argument we were so irritatedfirst arrive and there is a woman sitting behind the front counter and she does not greet us right away so we are standing there awkwardly not sure of what to do my partner asks "are we supposed to sit ourselves" to me then she finally greeted us and we were whisked away to a huge table for only the two of us all of the colors are bright in here which didn't bother me the same way they seem to bother everyone elsewe were given a very short menu with half in chinese but then after awhile i see another couple with a very extensive menu and i am left wondering wth i checked online before i went and saw that they had vegetarian options which i did not see on this extremely short menu the other couple was white and we are not so it was not like they got the better all chinese menu because they were asian or something when the owner comes to the table we request the other menu which he was happy to oblige there were so many options you could get lost in that menu but i liked itwe ordered a half duck and vegetables in oyster sauce with jasmine tea the duck came for some reason 10 minutes before my meal did so we both had to sit there waiting for my food because my partner did not want to eat without me no jasmine tea had come by that time 25 minutes after ordering the duck was greasy and cold as my partner described it; it was like if someone had cooked it earlier in the day and left it out room temperature and old tasting when they finally came with my meal i found that the 'vegetables' was really only bok choy in some oyster sauce i was very unhappy and the bok choy they gave me was mostly stems we had to remind the original waiter to bring our tea and we ordered some spring rolls at that timethe tea finally came and my partner asked for a spoon for the rice and that took 5 minutes to bring that i even think that was yet another waiter who came to the table my partner asked if they could warm up the duck which they did service was sooo slow even though there were many workers the spring rolls we ordered never came so in disgust we just had our meals boxed and walked up to the counter to pay rather than wait 20 minutes to pay a check at the table we will get our roasted duck from lee lee's from now on
0,most disgusting place ever had a hair in the dumpling of the dim sum one time which will be my ever last time to go there talked to them with the hair the services took the one away and come back without an apologize or anything and walk away again what a nice service and the food made me so sick all day hair in a dumpling ewwww even the boss was on the services site and said "well if she said no then it is no" so that means me as a customer is laying how funny11
0,sitting here at china king and am baffled at the high rating the waitress told me they would not honor the yelp  check-in special  the restaurant is filthy there is a film on the windows and a pair of children's shoes strewn across the waiting area  the child i think they belong to is actually standing on top of chairs screaming for his mom this is awful  there is also a dirty empty bucket just outside of the front door i'm not sure why but eww the men's room is so gross and there's just all sorts of eww everywhere my best instinct tells me i shouldn't have bothered but i gave it a whirl and the food wasn't *horrible* the fried rice was really bland the egg drop soup was kinda barfy it had nasty peas corn and carrots and the vegetables had been dehydrated they weren't dehydrated very well my entree was general tso's chicken it was certainly the highlight of the experience but the chicken itself seemed oddly dense and of low quality the prices weren't super great either i'm guessing all the hype is about the dim sum and the more exotic seafood offerings i'm still in disbelief that they would not accept the check-in special filth factor makes me wonder what kind of public health hazard china king is
0,unimpressed for dim sum on a tuesday  not very many carts with food someone was carrying food but bypassed our table and went to other tables  we had to call them to our table  by the time the person came to our table there wasn't much selection  service here is indifferent and lackluster  many tables are just waiting for any carts  definitely not worth coming her for dim sum especially on a tuesday  this is the worst dim sum experience i've ever had anywhere  was here before for dinner and it was uneventful
0,places sucks on service and food the food is bland and tasteless not much of it and the service is the worst i have seen yetthey never gave me a refill and tried to flag time several times unless your asian you may get better service will never go to this dump again

0,is nice but it was a 25 minute wait to get in and the food was only so-so way too expensive for the actual quality recommendation: get off the strip and try out chinatown or somewhere else not worth the wait
0,had this plate for an appetizer called "korean spicy vegetable cold noodle" and i was wondering what the heck could that be well it's neng myun noodles with a side of chojang  the neng myun has carrot shavings and yelllow squash shaving with peanut crumbles um yeah does that sound thai to you or is it just me i don't recall any korean dish with peanuts in itthey need to get their asians straightnot all asians look alike nor do their noodles taste the sametheir thai spicy shrimp noodle tasted very clean but it wasn't as tangy as i'd likethe cantonese dumpling soup tasted "clean" all the noodle soup stuff have a clean taste unlike the original "authentic" dirty asian stuff
0,(and most expensive) noodles everfor a whopping $13 i got the equivalent of a bowl of noodles that would've cost $4 at a normal noodle shop  i asked for udon noodles with my cantonese dumpling noodles  instead i got egg noodles  which was fine since egg noodles were probably the better choice for a noodle soup with dumplings  however i must've downed a whole pitcher of water by the time i was through with the noodles so one star for the price messing up my order and the saltiness that was pervasive in all of their noodle soups
0,fact that it's overpriced is pretty apparent but their service suckstake cindy for example who took care of our party of 9  for some reason i think she didn't like me because i wanted warm water  when i asked for the said item she responded with "we have tea - jasmine oolong etc"  i asked her again "do you have warm water"  she says "yes but we have tea"  ok i get the fucking point  you have tea and you're trying to charge me for it but i don't fucking want itwhilst taking my order cindy didn't understand when i pointed to what i wanted and specified "chicken"  because instead she tells me i can choose from bbq pork duck or chicken  i said yeah that chicken  ok that wasn't even the worse partwhen she brought back everyone's dishes my order was missing  however she had a two bbq item rice plate in her hand  i realized the person next to me had switched her order at the last minute and cindy the server must have accidentally switched my order  cindy hands me the rice plate and says "here you go"  i told her "i didn't order this  you must have accidentally switched my order out instead of the person next to me"  cindy responds with "you don't want this"  i said "no i didn't order this  i ordered the poached chicken rice noodle"  cindy says "oh" and runs offshe does indeed come back with the right order but never offers an apology  she gave me a fat attitude during the whole damn timeand the noodles  well i've had better  and it never cost me $1350i would never recommend noodles to anyone
0,way overpriced sure vegas is expensive but this place goes beyond overpriced to obscenely overpriced and for just ok food not much in way of veggie options and if you ask it's a flat no you can't make any changes tried to ask whether or not the vegetable roll had any meat or seafood in it i was met with "vegetable roll" and a weird totally fake smile but does it have any meat in it "vegetable roll" only a little louder with the fake smile there's no meat in it "vegetable roll" well that was helpful never mind i don't need to be eating fried food anyways food is also very salty i was dying of thirst for the rest of the day
0,bad  hotel food at its worst  $13 for wonton noodle soup and its cramped in a very small bowl  the service is nice  so overpriced though  $75 for 5 steamed dumplings  really  go elsewhere   whoever wrote the michelin review knows nothing about food
0,place is an insult to noodles dumplings and won ton  i've had noodles from everywhere from street vendors to trendy restaurants and this place was absolutely the worstthey even messed up the little things: orders came wrong and dishes were not matchingthe soup was so salty eating here was like torture and i happen to like salty foodeat here only if you are severely deficient in electrolytes
0,honestly believe i can serve people instant noodles off the street that taste a lot better then the garbage they serve here wouldn't be surprised to know that the food they serve are instant noodles but horribly fucked up by a "chef" that was born with no taste budsand for a place within such amega rich high class casino would it hurt you to serve filtered water instead of crap you get from the dish washeri mean honestly it's only a few bucks extra but it's little things like that gives you them extra points
0,think being vietnamese and all i would never come here every againhahaha it's funny when i looked at the menu to find pho being sold for $15  also congee being sold for even more  i got the malaysian fried rice and that was $20  i also got the ox tail soup which i can say was pretty good but it was $10  my friend got the combination rice which came with roasted duck which was a bit tastey and the soya chicken which came out cold and not very flavorfuli guess vietnamese or asian food is considered exotic espeically in vegas therefore they feel that they can jack up the prices really highi would definately not come here again espcially for the price and the taste wasn't on the authentic side either
0,waited in line which i thought showed a good sign that this noooooodles restaurant was good boy was i wrong tired from all the activities in the bellagio i was looking forward to a good meal i did not get it here the food was not great i wonder if i was eating a restaurant that didn't know they served bad food i wanted to take my food to go and give to a needy person on the street never again even if i hit the big $$$ in the casino
0,were one of the first to arrive at 10:30am on a saturday morning but the room filled up over the next hour  i failed to write down what we ate but 5 of the 7 dishes we tried contained pretty much the same ingredients of ground pork and shrimp  the best dish was the egg tarts with the worst being the barbecued pork bun which was all bun no pork  prices were relatively inexpensive but the food quality and variety were disappointing
0,we were here last year we didn't like this place much the service was slow we waited for the dim sum carts for 5-15 minutes i had to push the cart to our table boy i didn't think they run that fast after me since they were so slow with the cart p food was ok but i would recommend chang's hong kong cuisine instead
0,that do not go together discount & sushi freelance & gynecology refurbished & pacemaker and most recently dim sum & all day as soon as i heard it was an all day dim sum place my spidey sense went berserk i tried mentioning other options like noodle palace kfc or even cyanidebut i didn't want to be rude to the birthday girl so off we went 1st impression: it's 2pm on a fridaythis is so not the time to go for dim sum 2nd impression: overflowing trashcan as soon as you walk in ***getting nauseous*** 3rd impression: the smell of rancid oil ***mental note not to eat anything fried and getting more nauseous*** 4th impression: i bit down into a cold piece of siu mai ***thinking happy thoughts to hold back chunks***5th impression: 'why aren't we leaving' i think to myself as we proceed to order more food 6th impression: 12 the food that we order is cold and we are forced to ask the cart lady to get us hotter trays from the bottom of the cart ***thinking about where i can locate and epipen and wondering why we're still there*** in summary: this is one of the nastiest dim sum places i have ever encountered as i predicted all day dim sum means a lot of their stuff is frozen and machine made (eg har gao char siu bao etc) if you have no idea what good dim sum tastes like don't like yourself very much or are in a state where euthanasia is illegal then come on in otherwise avoid like the plague
0,place used to be goodwe've been going for a few years we overlooked that it was dirty because the food was cheap and good we're chinese and sadly expect a lot of good chinese food places to be on the dirty side over the past 6 months we've had really bad food experienceswe kept going back hoping it was going to get better again or maybe the last time was a bad fluke after 5 more of these bad experiences we knew we won't be going back even though it was the only place we knew that had 24hr dim sum the service is typical rude chinese and i'm chinese sometimes the dim sum is spoiled tasting recently they kept raised the prices of the dim sum and they will stamp a higher priced letter than what is listed on the menu we never complained when we first saw them stamping higher priced dim sum items when it should have been the lowest priced item because we didn't want to be the "complainers" it's also a totally different price than what they advertise on the sign outside  thank goodness my mom knows her math cuz i just pay a bill when i get it well they over charged us by $35 recently and had the nerve to argue with us about it when we forced them to re-add they never apologized or admitted to any wrong doing they corrected the amount put it on the table and walked away we definitely will never return and suggest that the people who do go keep a watchful eye on the dim sum stamp as well as add up your own bill and if it tastes wierd it's probably spoiled because they have all day dim sum and the crap may have been sitting out all day
0,how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star its like a restaurant has to try to get a 1 star review from mei came here around 12:15 waiting for my the others in my party when they arrived it was around 1pm we got seated and i swear someone released a stink bomb in the room or something the entire place turned into a ghost town calamari - i ate it it was cold was i in a sushi restaurant not a dim sum restaurant nope just horrible shrimp dumplings - one of the orders the skin fell apart the other the shrimp was all mushy as if it has been nuked in the microwave  pork dumplings - cold and mushy same texture as the shrimp dumplings  sesame balls - oily cold goopy item once this gets cold it just gross jook - they ran out by 1pm blahthere were more items but i guess they weren't good enough for me to remember the dishes some of you may be saying show up earlier or go during prime time dim sum time yup i'm fully aware of that but what kind of establishment goes from good to suckage for the changeover to regular lunch if a restaurant lets me order it i can review it as is this just shows poor quality control on their part willing to sacrifice their name to earn a couple of bucks for disappointing dim sum either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain timei'll be willing to give this place another chance and i'll come during prime time but i can't see the score improving that much until then stay out of this place after 1pm
0,been here several times with family since i was a kid the service is like many of the chinese restaurants in vegas bad which is fine since i'm used to it by now but my last experience here made me never want to come backi decided to come here one day craving dim sum it was the closest location to my school so i decided to pay orchid garden a visit i went in glad to see there was no line made i contact with at least 3 different people and had to wait 10 minutes before i was seated i understand if it is not your job as a cart pusher to seat customers but i'm sure you have the ability to sit me down at a table or at least notify the host to seat meonce i was seated i wanted ordered my usual har gow siu mai chow fun and shrimp balls; however after being served cold shrimp balls and siu mai i couldn't eat any more of the food they were serving the 5 waitresses running around the restaurant didn't ever have time to check and ask if "everything is okay" or if there's "anything i need" so i helped myself and my girlfriend to the counter asked for the check left no tip and walked outi highly recommend eating at cathay or chang's for dim sum they are alot friendlier and the food is much better
0,was our breakfast before we headed back home after our mini vacation in sin city after reading good reviews about this place the bf and i decided to give it a try and sadly we were disappointed first off they didn't open until 10:30 shouldn't dim sum be open at 8 when they finally opened we got seated right away but service was very slow as there was only one chart walking around to serve 12+ tables with families waiting for some dim sum i don't know why it's so packed but it must be good right wrong when the lady finally came up to us there wasn't a lot of selection to choose from and the usual items that we get back home weren't that good at all the shu mai was okay i give them that but  the chicken feet was disgusting and everything else didn't taste fresh at all totally would not eat here again

0,you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of workingthis is your gymcomplain to the manager and she gets nastytry getting in touch with the ownerimpossible  most unprofessional gym ever
0,had a big change of opinion after spending more time in that gym the equipment would often break down and never get fixed considering how small the gym is it's inexcusable that two treadmills would be out of service for at least a month i also had problems with the individual tvs on machines; sometimes they wouldn't work properly or would be completely brokenthe gym was generally quiet enough in the mornings but it would be pretty packed after work it was hard to find a machine the staff also didn't really enforce the 30 min time-limit policy which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessaryi was told on the phone i needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward (and not be charged for the next month) i wasn't told that i had to give 30 days notice (aka pay for an extra month) though they're technically right (it is in the contract) i feel that their staff mislead meif you live in shadyside (or nearby) go to urban active instead it's cheaper and the facilities are unbelievably better than xshadyside although i apparently have a membership at xshadyside for another month now i am 100% done with that place
0,went on a friday and it wasn't too busy we all had a wonderful time until the end we were in the womens locker room and even though they had a family locker room there were little boys there about 6-7 years old changing in the room too and one walking around with no clothes on i had my little sister and did not appreciate it at all when i talked to staff all they asked me was if they had autism it doesnt chnge anythingcome on there was a family bathroom right there and they didn't seem too concerned about my complaint and the bathrooms were nasty but if you don't use the locker rooms or bathrooms it is good
0,is a problem  i had my phone and keys stolen from me while i was in the pool at dowd  my babysitter had her car broken into in the dowd parking lot as well both of these events took place within the last 2 months  it is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe
0,20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $10 bucks a month for that price i can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the y this place is seriously over sold stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members serious over crowding issue
0,20 mins for an elliptical the weights are limited and they don't have a lot of machines oversold memberships i just closed my over priced membership and joined fitness connection where everything is new and only 10 bucks a month the y is overrated
0, don't know why i keep going back to olive or twist seriously you could check my foursquare stats and see that i've been to this bar more frequently than any place i've ever called my favorite spot in pittsburgh why i moved up here from orlando to be with my boyfriend who i had just started dating i moved because orlando on a whole sucks and i was ready to get out my boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now this was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them they used to get free or greatly reduced drinks could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted etc etc - the ush i tag along now because i didn't know many people in this city at first obviously the bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night i've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired the drinks are poured strongly at first i thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks but now i realize they're just heavy handed nothing here really sticks out for me i can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price same with the food i guess the only reason i agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - amy and linda those two are the most kick ass bartenders in pittsburgh considering i currently live in heinz it's also pretty damn close which works in its favor (can't wait to move  ) olive or twist has a great location and if amy andor linda are working you're sure to enjoy yourself just keep those expectations low
0,were in pittsburgh for one night and olive or twist was near our hotel  there were many other restaurants but this place looked nice  the atmosphere was nice and if i was rating only for atmosphere i'd give it 4 stars  however i'm mainly rating their food and service  we were greeted promptly but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinksfood even though there weren't many people in the dining room  i ordered the traditional french dip sandwich and fries  i enjoy a good french dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst i've ever eaten in fact i couldn't finish it  the meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap glorified hot dog roll that was soggy  it wasn't soggy from the au jus but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason  overall if i was going back to pittsburgh in this area i would stay far away from olive or twist
0,actually had ok experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad i tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move  upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding klassy for reasons i truly can't explain we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination we both threw down a brew nasty paid and left unfortunately for olive or twist the visit would probably be our laston a positive note there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set his warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started when it's all said and done we should have just went to the sharp edge down the street probably a much safer bet for future endeavors
0,or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal
0,bar is cramped overpriced and the service is unbelievably slow happy hour runs 4-6 so you'll show up at 5 have no place to sit or stand and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours you'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5 even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times i've been there)seriously avoid this place when one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour direct them anywhere else
0,disappointed  i had been to olive or twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal  i was going to a show at the benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show  we arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet  the problem is that even though i called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name  the hostess said something along the lines of "are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else"  yes i'm pretty sure i called the right restaurant  she kept looking at the room of empty tables looking at the book and then looking at us  after a few minutes of back and forth she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there  so we trudged upstairs  all that was available were small high top tables  being a friday night it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy  not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of itwe started with the buffalo chicken dip appetizer  it is served in a martini glass with toastedfried pita chips  it was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was  the problems with food began with the pacing of the meal  we had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out  it may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs but being at the high top bar tables we had no room for our drinks appetizer and meal  we found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything  it was frustrating  not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees  with as much as we enjoyed the appetizer we were looking forward to our meals unfortunately they were very disappointing  my friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes  her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm  when she mentioned it to the server the server said "so would you like me to take them back or are they ok"  when would cold mashed potatoes ever be ok  when her potatoes were brought back warmed she was disappointed because they were called "garlic mashed" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at alli ordered the caribbean jerk chicken  it was described as "grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices pepper jack cheese garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a kaiser roll"  no mention of a tomato  when i got the sandwich there were three tomatoes on it   thankfully i just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue  there was also no pineapple chutney  when i asked about it the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the rolloverall very disappointed  i wanted to love olive or twist because i really enjoyed the time i had visited for a drink but the dining experience was sorely lacking especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out
0,the request of a friend we had a brief girls night out at olive or twist my first impression was the outdated decor the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting the drink menu is extensive; but with the exception of one person in my party we each found our drinks far too sweet i ordered the cucumber basil martini which was so sweet i had to send it back the food was mediocre i ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done and then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s the music was so loud and so bad that my friends i left and headed down the street to butcher and the rye
0,stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends we were in town visiting and i had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip what a disappointment  the server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes  it would've been different if she had been slammed but the entire time she was standing by the bar just talking to her coworkers  by the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave and we should have the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired  when we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us  the one positive of the place was that i liked the ambiance but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster  what i was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood
0,ordered calamari  tasted like the oil was very old   watched waiter bring our food to table next to us and then take it back to kitchenthen they brought us both salads with old brown lettuce    seriously that was a first for me  i have never been served spoiled lettuce at a restaurant     hubby had salmon and said the flavor was good   i had stuffed pork loin special which was good with the exception of the "side" of pasta with pink disgusting sauce on it   what a disappointment
0,would not dine there again  the food was bland and flavorless  the atmosphere and pasta weren't bad  my husband also said the espresso wasn't bad  i think they cater to the over 65 crowd
0,service from the get go the only reason why we went here was because a restaurantscom coupon  we had bought and they just make you feel like you are getting it for free they do not realize that we paid for the coupon and this is a way to have your restaurant be known i have another groupon and i rather lose it then go again
0,went here for a birthday expecting it to be good based on the reviews the restaurant itself is nice but the food was terrible beyond belief i got the steak from there and when i cut into it it looked stringing rough and disgusting i couldn't eat it my family was completely grossed out with their meals when we went to tell the lady that our meals were terrible she was being sarcastic and very rude in my opinion she has no respect for customers what so ever and for as nice as restaurant it is i will never go there again
0,not come here i'm not sure why this restaurant gets the reviews it does first off salmon is not white its pink  we spent 25 dollars on the special that was far from special  dried out crab stuffed in white chewing salmon reallythe veal don't get us started  chewy and i'm not convinced it was actually veal the vegetables on both plates were not even luke warm  go to babbo and spend a 34 of what we did  what i'd do to have my 80 plus dollars back  summed up just buy a tv dinner and save the cash
0,have been going to salute for over 10 years  has been our favorite place to go  went there for new years eve last night never again  still great food service questionable depending on the server but the ownerboss whatever she is has to be the most ignorant uncaring un-service oriented person i have ever met  we merely questioned the menu re the lack of potato with a steak the lack of caesar salad at an italian restaurant and she more or less told us too bad the chef is working hard  she told us that is the way it is no apology  we wanted to use a gift certificate from restaurantcom wouldn't accept it  finally agreed to take a plain gift certificate  we told her that we were not happy and would not be back  she blatantly said "i don't care"   they will be out of business within 2 years  too bad great place  we talked to both staff members and other patrons on the way out and they totally agreed
0,how the mighty have fallen  when i first moved to charlotte in '04 this was one of my favorite spots to hit  the wednesday lunch buffet was killer and the weekend breakfast buffet was equally awesome  the girls ranged from night to night but overall it was a solid showingmoving back to charlotte in '10 we went back to our old stomping grounds for more fun and frivolity  like an amusement park you used to go to as a kid we were saddened to see our awesome fun park degraded into a washed up shadow of its former selfit's strange when the management changed they prettied up the place with a wine cellar and a second floor expansion yet everything else in the place went to shit  the quality of the ladies took a drastic hit  last night's saturday roster is what i would expect to see on a tuesday afternoon  also the security was not as sharp as it used to be  one time at the breakfast buffet a fight broke out between two groups of asians right by the omelette station  instead of well dressed bouncers swooping down to disperse the crowd the fight just fizzled out on its own with no interaction from security whatsoeveri used to recommend this place to everyone coming through charlotte for its fun atmosphere and good food  now i can barely recommend the food and would honestly steer my friends to other places
0,not a single pole in the place so the girls amble on to the stage as if they just woke up they walk from one side of the stage to the next doing nothing because they might trip and break the ankle there is no pole on the stage thus nothing to hold on to to try to bust some movesthis place is pretentious and over priced the girls there have no talent and don't really care
0,place i've ever been to    no service or women i would never come in this place ever again  women are not attractive and staff is even worsebeer is almost $8 with no girls in sight  what a joke  this place is the worst place i've ever been to and i've been all over the world
0,i really like this place and go often but i had a rotten experience here last night that has ruined my opinion of this place forever i went with a friend at night and ordered drinks i gave a card and id for my tab and my friend paid for drinks with cash as he got them at the end of the night my friend checked out and then i paid the bill i then found out that our waitress was billing my friends drinks to my tab while she's pocketing cash from my friendi had to sign for the bill and the manager essentially told me to take a long walk off a short pier usually this place quite good but at night it turns to a den of thieves
0,star is generous  they literary had 3 cigars for sale
0,ghetto  they lure you in with the temptation of a raffle ticket for a cash drawing to take place "any minute"  so you come inside with your "winning ticket"  nothing to do while waiting except select one of the few slot machines in this tiny joint and slide some cash in  then here comes the cocktail waitress  order is placed and drink delivered  time for the tip  well i always tip and did this time  however another guy nearby wasn't going to tip apparently  so the waitress stands there for like 90 seconds after delivering the drink with her hand stuck outjust standing there by this guy   she refused to just walk away  the guy finally says something like he'll take care of her next time around  that really pisses her off and she spouts an obscene comment then abruptly turns walks away and starts slamming things  first time i've ever witnessed anything like thati guess this must be part of the fremont street experience too   ha ha
0,of all the place is a hole and not in a good way i wouldn't mind so much except i had an issue with the security guard who pinpointed me as "trouble" i suppose since it was halloween and i was wearing a hat that looked like a lion- it's a hat for children perhaps i scared him but he told me in order to remain in this establishment i'd have to remove my hat i found this to be interesting since there were plenty of people inside of the casino wearing hats and not being asked to take theirs off many were in costume many were extremely shady looking but he just passed by them without a second glance maybe he really dislikes lions either way he pissed me off thanks to the cocktail waitress for the 2 free beers- she was pleasant at least
0, had a rough time here last night  here's how it started  i looked at the menu at their specialty cocktails and saw one that tickled my fancy: the naughty lemonade made of simply ty ku and lemonade  we went to the bar and here is how the conversation went:"hi i'll have a naughty lemonade"(waitress scrunches face) "huh""a naughty lemonade""what's that""ummm it's on your menu  it's ty ku and lemonade""what's ty ku  i don't think we have that""it's that green bottle right behind you""ohhh this must be something new""no it's been around a couple of years and like i said it's on your menu mixed with lemonade"(waitress opens the bottle and smells it) "do you want to smell it before you try it""ummm no i've had it before that's why i ordered it""do you want to try a sip""ok you know what  forget it i'll just have a vodka and sprite""ok a cranberry vodka coming up""no a vodka and sprite""oh ok"and that's just how it started  other incidents:- we were done with our drinks sitting there with empty glasses  she comes over and says "oh did you guys want another round or something"- my friends were playing the machines for a good hour and she didn't comp them any drinks (usually customary if you play the machines at the bar) until they asked about it  then she said she didn't realize they had playedeven though she cashed out their machine  - my friend ordered a johnnie walker and she gave him the jw black without asking if he wanted the upsell  when he called her on that after we looked at the bill she said "oh i thought you said you wanted the black"  noooope never came out of his mouth any of the times he ordered itby the end of the night we had about 4 different receipts because we kept finding mistakes with our bill and she had to keep changing it  it was exasperating and frustrating
0,you like good service good food and a nice atmosphere bjs is not for you if your number one priority is cheap food and drinks then this is a good choice they get one star for the $475 patron margarita but it took over 30 minutes to get it and the first time they brought me a gin and tonic i was a little worried since it took so long to get my drink in the first place even the people who only ordered beers had to wait 30 minutes they have 1 bartender and don't let the wait staff go behind the bar to get any drinks they have a decent menu of bar type food and the food was ok but half of the table had finished their food before the other half got theirs the group i was with in vegas loved it though and went every night i reluctantly went a second time but begged off after that1
0,don't usually write reviews and bad ones at that but here we are i question what this place is a dive bar a sports bar a lounge on one side with pool tables and a liquor store whatever the case their happy hour is cheap drinks so that's a plus (and what the 1 star is for) other then that the food is good but there's nothing special ( i had the caprese salad) i could make it all for 18 the price and better ingredients the ambiance is blah and smokey so again my home would be more entertaining the blonde bartender won't let you get a word out so i recommend you flag someone else down good luck with checks you will have 10 of them at the end of the night with anyone that served you anything
0,would give this place 0 stars if i couldright now i am in my room at the wynn encore i taxi'ed out with a few friends all the way to mandalay bay to experience red squarethey're earliest closing time is 2am we arrived at their front door to red square at 12:55 they were closed door locked we saw someone leave so we entered inside the ladyhostess came up to us i asked if they were still open she replied with a rude tone " no we're closed" i asked why they advertised a 2am closing time she replied quickly "its clean up hour"couldn't you clean after 2 am wtf why don't you post 1am closing on weds night instead of every website listing 2am as a closing time that is the most unprofessional encounter i've had in las vegas even hookers have more professionalism than that thank you for wasting our time money and 3 cab rides therei seriously doubt i'll ever stay at mandalay bay or any of my friendsthank you wynn encore for the comp'ed rooms
0,loved it when i was there the staff was very friendly and the decor was so interesting i had the prawns - they were a bit bland but not awful until i woke up with food poisoning i was so sick i could not move - i had to change my flight out of vegas and stay an extra day just to recover be very careful the meal was quite expensive and i am disgusted to think of what the kitchen must look like for me to get so sick
0,first off- this place does have some good martini's and what not but this review is not for their ownership of good alcoholit is for the food  this was not russian food  i came to this place because some one had posted on yelp that they had a true russian menu  i really didnt see that at all  their menu was just like every other food menu in a restaurant in vegas that is trying to be swanky  yeah tuna tartare and steak topped with things- you know what i am talking aboutso the food was really not russian fare- and the food that we did have wasnt even good  i got the butterfish dish- i mean u cant really go wrong with butterfish-but they did  it was disgusting  it was served in like a bright red sauce- that stained my lips even-so grossvery disappointing dining experience :(
0,their posted hours because they do toowifey and i made the trek from the hilton all the way to mandalay bay to visit our favorite vodka bar only to find out that they decided to close an hour early according to the girl that came rushing to the door red square closes whenever they want depending on how busy they are don't advertise your closing time when in reality it doesn't matter at all
0,back a week ago to try this place again  the hostess was rude lazy and useless and did not fit a "russian" restaurant  we were ready to spend $150 for two at this place and they could not even do the simple job of making us feel welcomed
0,sorry but the red square is not good anymore  the food is tired and poor quality  i had the worst lobster bisque in my life  the calamari was icky and the main courses were even worse   they need a refresh i feel bad giving it a one star because our server was wonderful
0,attended a work dinner here at red square at mandalay the waitstaff was friendly but very inept they delivered a wine that was two years more recent than ordered and continued to bungle the stroganoff was not as food as the hamburger helper version i'd avoid this place especially for the money
0,read somewhere that this was the best bar in las vegas and when i went to finally try it i don't see how that could be  it was a friday night at around 11:30 or 12 am and we were met at the entrance with someone with their hand up saying that they were closed a bar in vegas closed at 12 am in vegas  there were like 20 people in the bar long story short i will never go there again
0,grill mgmt sold its stake in red square to light group because mandalay bay is having light group take over  a number of their restaurants in their "restaurant row" no more china grill no more "red white & blue" and no more "happy hours" or "specials" particularly at red squarei loved red square's "cavihour" a cheap happy hour (cheap for the strip) where you got a 12 oz of american caviar with the fixin's (blinis creme fraische toast points shallots it was terrific) for the price of 2 shots (or cocktails) of russian vodka it was so much fun cheesy yes but funbut tonight i found out the cavihour is dead as are all happy hours previously run by china grill mgmt at red squarewe are very sad localsso long live cavihour we shall never return to red square
0,show don't gothe food is just so so  the service is atrocious when we asked if the poor service was due to short staffing that evening we were told no  we got no apology or explanation
0,not going to rate this for the crowd that it draws since that can change depending on the day of the weekit has a nice rooftop view but venue decor is not as nice as mix or foundation roombut the main reason for the one star-  we ordered effen raspberry chilled and the bartender mistakenly (i hope) uses sky vodka and than adds a little effen raspberry  when askes about it she said she knew what she 'knows what she's doing'  well if she 'knew' what she was doing that's shady using cheaper vodka and saying it's the better stuff  and if she made the mistake why not just own up to it and at the very least pour new rounds
0,place is a jokeid rather be at tao or purethe maloofs really know what class is britneys classyhahano thanksthats all
0,music horrible strobes that cause drunk people to bounce into me every second and then the wait to leavewhat kind of club has a freakin wait to get out  a bad one that's wherewe waited over thirty minutes to get the fuck out of therebest bet is to fake a seizure from all those freaking strobescrappy
0,suck paul pierce  what a major cock-blocker  guess what dog - none of the staff at either the playboy club or moon likes your ass so don't bother coming back  what  you don't want people taking your picture  then stay out the hell out the club and stop mackin on the girls in our group chump  aren't you married with children or something  all that's unecessary dudeand what are you so "agitated" about when you got pulled over 2 hours laterthat pro you left with didn't give you a rub and tug  the only thing that probably got blown that night was the breathalyzer machine when lvpd pulled your dumbass over and should have arrested you for a dui or dwb - whichever  you've got no class
0,you like to support a dishonest staff that tries to get the girls you are with into their club by telling you they'll get your group in free only to wait for an hour because of a slow elevator entrance to be charged full price anyways after they escort your ladies in free and then go hang out in a sausage fest then this is the club for youheaven forbid anyone in your group insist that they live up to their word either or they'll just call security to come and toss them outi dont mind paying entrance for a club but i do mind being hustled and then watching an arrogant staff treat my friend like dirt once he calls them on it the one redeeming quality about this club is that it has a great view of the strip but it isnt worth a disorganized staff that cant stay on the same page with each other regarding entrance a dance floor full of dudes and just a generally indignant attitude  i went to lavo and rain during my stay and in comparison i can confidently say i wont be heading back to moon ever again
0,why would you go to this club which has a tiny dancefloor as opposed to raindon't be fooled by the bouncers and doormen here they will waste your time and feed you lies  these morons which are probably high school drop outs are very unprofessionalthe promoters at this club should just quit because they need to learn how to have a good girl to guy ratio plus who was the retard that made one of the barriers to the club by coming into an elevator firstso if you do enjoy this club you most likely are either getting hustled or prefer hairy cylindrical objects forced in your mouth also my friend who went  to this club got her behind grabbed by a guy who already had a girlfriend
0,must have been there on a bad night (sunday) because there were not actually any people there even the free bottle of vodka did not help the situation it did have a good view of the strip but that only entertained me for about 3 minutes drank our vodka and then moved on to lavothat is where the people were
0,i know that some people really love this club but i am not one of those people  if i had to pay to get in to this club i would still have asked for my money back  there was 3 lines that were long as hell (that's to be expected in las vegas)  there were several people getting by saying that they knew a guy naed raul  the club was over populated and the music was horrible  the most up to date song they played came out in 2002  having to go up to the 53rd floor was cool at first but trying to get down made me feel like a prisoner  i had 4 girls in my group and they wouldn't let all of us on the elevator  one person was held back (literally)  we were only there for about an hour  if you have anything else to do do it
0,from reading these reviews i really though moon was gonna be awesome but it sucked  maybe it was just an off night there but it just seemed like a lamer version of rain (also in the palms)  it is just one boring room with a dance floor  we had bought vip all-access passes and were told that they basically meant nothing and we had to wait in the line with everybody else (these are the $85 blue wrist bands don't bother buying them)  also a bouncer watched a drunk guy basically dump a drink all over me and my boyfriend and didn't do anything about it  then the elevator mass (you could not call it a line) was out of control but luckily we pushed through and were able to get on the next train out of moon  thank god
0,usually hit this place on thursdays which is usually pretty dead  went this time on a friday and it was wack  i don't know what was up with this crowd but my friends described it as "busted guy land"  i think this guy was trying to slip something in my drink until my husband showed up and he ran away  i keep giving this place a chance but i'm done  oh and let's not forget the chick fight on the dancefloorvery classy
0,into this place looking for some mixed drinks  the bartender told us they were known for they fruity drinks but not margaritas  he could mix any juice with vodka  we left
0,few weeks ago a few friends and myself rolled in here to check this place out  i walked up to the bar and immediately ordered a bottled beer which cost about 4 bucks which i thought was a little steep i then proceeded to glance around the bar and almost immediately realized that we had made a poor decision i'm no xenophobe but a cursory glance of the bar area led me to believe that i was in the middle of a un convention in uptown charlotte  i have no problems with "gays and gangbangers" as reviewer jason l referenced but it is definitely not my crowdthe bar is undersized old dirty and generally an undesirable place to congregate  other reviews have commented on the attractiveness of the bartenders and i will not deny that but if your sole reason for going to a bar is for the attractive women that work there then i recommend going over to the establishment on e morehead stneedless to say i will not be going back to this place
0,may end up here on sat night if all the other area bars are busyi'm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasn't my choice to come here one of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have 'one shot' he lives in the avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff  we got quick and efficient service at a great priceand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shotsthis place is rough watch your back there is a lot of drama and the kind of place where testosterone mixed with alcohol can make for a volatile mix
0,the hell phil's tavern every time i come here (usually before a show) things just don't work out i wanted them to but they just didn'tfood: the only food i've tried here were the jalapano poppers and then i never tried anything here again how do you burn something in a deep fryer normally i'd just be impressed but i was hungry drinks: their drink specials are nothing to write home about the dirty martini was weak and the tiny shrivelled spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress at least it was only $5 unfortunately the corona of the person i was with only cost fifty cents less than that $450 for a warm corona do not wantservice: nice but few and far betweenatmosphere: dank dirty sticky these are only a few of the descriptors for this place i fear the day where i will have no choice but to use the facilities hereoverall: don't waste your time and money i hear there's better places in this area i just need to find them
0,and chad could not be more right this place is the dive bar of charlotte looks and feels as greasy and grimy as it smells i had no idea they served food until these reviews mentioned it i do not even know if they have a bathroom i frequent a lot of the uptown bars for a few drinks before it's time to go home every weekday i went to phil's a total of 3 times the first time i went i got 2 beers drank them attempted to pay but was told they can't run my card without at least $10 ran so after ordering a shot to bring my bill up to par i paid and left i assume this is why a bottled 12oz is $4 and miller lite is always on 'special' no one said anything other than "hi whatcha drinkin" "another one" and "that's all for ya" the second time it was trivia night it seemed fun so i took a few pics of the place the bartender people playing trivia and the specials board i paid for my beers with cash and left i went back a few days later and was quickly "greeted" by the brontosaurus behind the bar "i heard you were taking pictures of us the last time you were here you are not welcome here and need to leave" now i've been kicked out of bars before but it's because i did something wrong (got in a fight threw up somewhere etc) so this was a first there were 2 people at the bar who quickly looked up and started looking me up and down thinking there was no good way to explain myself monosyllabically enough for her to understand i said "yes ma'am" and took my leave laughing at the situation everything would have been fine except as i was leaving i overheard her mumble "pervert" in hindsight i can see where i may have used poor judgement or should have asked if it was ok first and for that i am sorry but she did not even attempt to speak to me before publicly jumping to conclusions she "heard" insinuating i was taking lewd pictures for my own personal pleasure the bartenders are nothing except a lifeless ordinary working to earn cash and doing a bad job at trying there are other establishments near here that offer more for less with decent conversation and pleasant aromas for as slow as this place always seemed to be i can't imagine why the staff are quick to judge but perhaps that's the normal clientele that frequents this establishment and i can see why i obviously will never be back if you do not want to be looked at and judged when you walk in and then talked about disparagingly when you leave stay as far away from here as possible there are much better places that will give you fantastic service and a conversation for a fraction of your overall cost
0,place is terrible  never go here ever it was 5 people in there i ordered some wings and the bar wench forgot about me it took an hour to get my mediocre wings
0,we have had an ant in our drink watched bartenders touch people's food and a bouncer refused to kick out a guy who showed his junk to girls classiest place ever
0,so over t-bonesi used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that i liked  i was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck  but the last 3 times i've been to t-bones the food and service have been awful  and they changed the menu removing the grilled chicken breast salad that i liked  the sweet tea was almost as clear as water and painfully sweet--undrinkablei'm sorry t-bones  we tried to make it work but it takes two  please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (i know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge  it's just not enough to keep us coming anymore  you actually have to serve good food and decent drinks
0,is well below average starting with the drinks tea was very weak and the glasses were very small appetizer hot wings were mediocre at best not hot and sorta greasy wife got salad which was unimpressive and a little wilted wife had filet which she described as  a poor cut of meat tough with gristle i got a ribeye if you could call it that it appeared to be pan fried as is was greasy it was a very poor cut of meat with much fat and gristle sweet potato was good except it was very small   service was good as we were in a group of 12  glasses were kept full and service prompt cost is hard to believe you pay for a choice cut of meat and get waffle house food  i went to this place probably 15 years ago was not impressed then has gotten worse not inclined to go to places were they have to have armed police officers on duty for the protection of their patrons   this placed is off the list will not return
0,was good but food not  you don't realize how awful the food really is until about 30 minutes after you have eaten it  5 of us eat there tonight we each had different items pasta fish and chips potato skins combination of vegetable sides a sandwich and other items   everything was greazy and salty  but you don't realize how much grease until 15-30 minutes after eating when your skin gets oily you feel sludgy thirsty and loose your energy  i don't know what grease or ingredients they use but it's terrible  we all went home after and didn't feel like doing anything after thisi've been there before for beer on the deck the beer is good but don't eat the food  contrary to many of the other reviews the service was very good  meghan was our waitress
0,this is the only place on lake wylie to eat when you are out on your boat other than a snack bar the deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business if you want a drink order beer or wine the drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited  the food leaves a lot to be desired  we ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up we were wrong  the chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor  the filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing the cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting  the hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre  the fries were mushy and limp   on top of all this the place appears grungy and dated  the place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it this is the last chance we are giving this place  hopefully everyone will also give up on it so a decent place can be moved in but i think the building is beyond saving at this point
0,never realized how gross this place was until i went sober with a group of 13 from work yes it is great to be on the lake but the place needs some major renovations the inside smells horrible like old and soggy and dusty i ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting i think the salmon took on the flavor of the smell of the inside which was nasty i have enjoyed the chicken quesadilla and drinks before but that's about it actually i forgot their sunday brunch is pretty good and they do a bloody mary bar that is good too don't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful they also took forever when the restaurant seemed fairly dead they need to remodel and hire a new chef to re-write the menu because you cannot beat the location they also need more boat slips it always fills up fast on the weekend
0,atmosphere and location but the food is sad just sad won't be coming back it's fine if you want to enjoy a few beers by the water but don't come hungry
0,and decor are horrific only redeeming factor is its location; well that and the fact that it's closed 8 hours a day
0,feel as though i needed to write this review this is just tragic that such a prime  location on the lake has terrible food service and if that isn't enough even their drinks are so solive in town and never been happy with the food only up is the location do not waste $$ on food i have had ribs: too soft and drenched in bbq saucefish sandwich: fish sticks brown lettuce hamburger: dry bun no flavorwings: the worst slimy and others as well you've been warnedbest and only thing is good music nice deck w water views and drinks on a summer night or day live music is fun awesome for hanging out w drinks not a food place
0,menu looked good but very expensive the food was average i can see no justification for their prices our main entrees were delivered to the table before our appetizer and salads i can understand having problems if it's busy but it wasn't i'm very disappointed in everything about this restaurant we won't be coming back unless we have to and if we do we'll make sure we eat somewhere else first
0,is the worst example of a "steakhouse" ever  the owner is a self righteous fool that loves to cause trouble if you give feedback  lousy place on lake wylie sc
0,service  we went for "taco tuesday"  we waited for nearly 15 minutes before walking up to the bar to ask if we could get some service  "i thought you were helped" the lady grunted at me as she took our order  she was the only bar keep in the place  must have an alzheimer's style memory nearly 10 minutes later our drinks showed up  we witnessed others get their food that had ordered after we did  we ordered the taco special so being "taco tuesday" one would think these would be readily available  finally after 12 hour we got our food tossed on the table  the personable waitress didn't notice our drinks were empty so i had to walk the glasses to the bar to get them refilled  while waiting quietly some harley- riding local came in and he was greeted like royalty  he barged right in front of me and he got served pronto the bar tender went to him like files to a fresh pile of doo   thankslooks like the only way you'll get served here is if you are known by the employees ride a harley have more tattoos than stripper convention or poor hygienethe food was decent at  $575 for a taco the price was awesome  i'd go back if it weren't for the lousy service  maybe i should buy  a new electra-glide next time i want a taco
0,place was gross and depressing  we live nearby but i will avoid ever going back  we went to taco tuesday and were greeted with horrible service and even worse food  i did not come here expecting anything nice or classy so even with low expectations i left feeling slightly down and depressed from this sad place
0,had gone to eagles crest for lunch a few times and decided to take my family from out of town one weekend when we arrived there was a sign on the front door saying that it was customer appreciation day we bought a round of drinks and found a table to sit at other patrons were going through the food line which was set up at the pool table  but my sister-in-law went to get a veggie plate one of the female staff came from around the bar and slapped the plate out of her hand and told us that we were not welcome there we finished our drinks and left as we were leaving we checked the sign on door again to see if it was marked private party but it was not after that experience i will never go back to eagles crest
0,i could give the harmony less than one star i would i live in the shenk-atwood neighborhood so i'm not writing as an outsider i've been to the harmony many times but i'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner bartenders and waitstaff at the harmony the harmony is worse than seinfeld's soup nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers i won't get into specifics i can only say that i take pride in my neighborhood my wife and i frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such the harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood and i am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment if you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager the last time i was in there with a group of friends she couldn't have been more rude or insulting when we all said we wouldn't be back she merely shrugged her shoulders if you're visiting the east side there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service alchemy mickey's wilson's the weary traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the east side  if you're a masochist be sure to head on over the harmony for your daily dose of abuse you've been warned you certainly won't catch me sitting at this bar ever again
0,unfriendly atmosphere at the harmony bar is its biggest failing  at first i thought it was just sarcastic "soup nazi" humor but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees customers and even performers  i've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customersalso it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band  i once saw a harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights jumping up on the stage and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave  i was floored  it was the first time i'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early  the kitchen staff works hard and the food is decent  unfortunately this is the only bar i've ever been to in madison where i've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front  (there are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards but they still let you run a tab) it made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor servicein short even on occasions when they book national acts it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar  there are too many other fun places to go in madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at the "harmony"
0,see that all the negative reviews for this business have been flagged to those thinking of trying this establishment: read the flagged reviews you will have a far more balanced and accurate assessment
0,is flagging down all the one-star reviews for the harmony bar to anyone considering patronizing this establishment: read the flagged reviews
0,service is absolutely horrible the staff is rude and acts put out by your mere presence
0,selection is ok good room for seeing bands - sound was great however majority of the male staff here is unapologetically rude & disrespectful aging sports neanderthals that could care less that you're there  don't waste your time - spend your money at mickey's tavern or crystal corner instead
0,didn't like this placefirst the service is slowsecond the food is not that goodgyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy i don't wanna talk about friesso this place is so overrated
0,another bad geovanti's experience againthis time i ordered a "famous" calzone however the servbice is still sooo slow aprrox 15 mins after my order i asked the guy on the cashier about the situation and he told me back "it'll be ready in 2 mins" and after another 15 mins he said the calzone is ready geealso i do not recommend you to go there for a "dine-in" dinner coz people usually have a party in downstairs and make noise your dinner would become a disasterps: the taste of calzone is nearly perfect but it doesn't change my thoughts about this placethumbs down again unfortunately
0,made the mistake of reading the reviews of this place and deciding to order food online i had eaten at geovanti's once before and was underwhelmed to say the least  but who can turn down amazing chicken strips well it took over an hour and a half to get the order and once it arrived it was soggy and lukewarm  yuck  i can tell you that i will never order from geovanti's againif you are at the restaurant its 2 am and you're drunk then the food here is ok and the wait for it won't seem too long under those conditions i say go for it  otherwise stay away
0,really do like their chicken strips  my previous review is still accurate but the last time i went the management change shows and the new service staff is slow and inefficient  the place was always borderline sketchy but with the new folks it seems to have plummeted and i recently saw their champaign county restaurant inspection reports and they have been failing them with pretty egregious offensesdon't get me wrong most restaurants have issues and even fail these inspections but issues with hot water spoiled foods and pestsi won't be headed back anytime soon
0,start this review by saying that when we are at that point my girlfriend and i will be going to jos a bank for mine and my groomsman's suits  allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from men's wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding1- they never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call  the other groomsmen and i had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone2- they sent two of our tuxedos to homestead when we asked for them to be sent to ross park mall during the fitting3- when one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said "oh i don't know" (insert an awkward pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say "let me check that for you") he instead said "well i'm going to hang up now"  and he made good on that promise and hung up4- despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to5- we were at one point informed that mw had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know  not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect6- one of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white  another received no studs  we discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization7- on picking up my tux i informed the associate "i'll be unable to get to a men's wearhouse for a few days after the wedding is this alright" to which she responded "yeah that should be fine" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee i was totally caught off guard8- my girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at ross park mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee9- as the best man i was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at men's wearhouse  since i am in another wedding next month with rentals from mw i figured this would be an opportune time to use it  imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental when i presented the coupon and was told "oh that isn't for this  that is intended for your wedding  oh and it expires on december 31st of this year" 10- the groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own rather than rent a tux for the occasion  he was ensured by the homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it  when he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use  granted now i am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last weekover my friends wedding weekend any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding the joke between the groom and his groomsmen was "effing men's wearhouse"  for example at a restaurant "wait i asked for no onions on this sandwich - effing men's wearhouse"  "noise complaint at the hotel room men's wearhouse"another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me "i hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding" to which i replied "perhaps i could find better service from goodwill of western pa"congrats men's wearhouse  you became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suitstl;dr - 10 mistakes several rude associates and 1 future groom going to jos a bank
0, stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item  i wanted to try on a $400 furand the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me  he then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so  he would not let me handle the coat myself because it was "very expensive"  he watched me while i tried it on and then immediately took it off me  i wanted to tell him that $400 wasn't pricey for a winter coat and that i could easily afford it but decided to walk out without purchasing it  i won't be back
0,help me god if i ever get married or have a sex change and need a tuxedo i am never coming to this men's warehouse againwe unluckily got helped by morgan to get fitted for a wedding my boyfriend is in this upcoming july from the get go the gum-chewing-lip-smacking morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service we arrived with a coupon from david's bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for prom only (despite the small print not saying prom only rentals) when i told her where we'd gotten the code she agreed that yes a $40 coupon was in david's bridals free catalogs at the store but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discountso let me go over this: i have a coupon give coupon not valid on this transaction but there are other coupons in the same place you got this i don't have that coupon sorry cannot help you even though i know that coupon exists and the code is simply dbaw and 6 numberswow wow and wow some of you out there might be saying "well you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only it's what it was and too bad" but here's the thing: customer service customer service means service with a smile (no smile on morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing check) customer service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use) customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common senseso what did i do when she rang up the charge full price i called david's bridal in northlake and got amazing customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code which i told to an apathetic morgan me - 1 her - 0 chick you don't even know the lengths i will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible helpand what's a cake without icing totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands hands cigarette mouth touching customers yuck
0,groomsman and i bought the suits for my wedding here 4 of us that i know were sized wrong  customer service was terrible after we purchased our suits they would not correct it  highly recommend not buying a suit here  these people do not know what they're doing
0,have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited i've been twice now when i was looking for a particular color  style when asked if i needed any assistance the answer to "yes i'm looking for x type of jacket in x color" should not be to say "hold on a few minutes while i" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answersave yourself the hassle and go check out pretty much anywhere else i hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores at least there i'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something
0,experience ever we went to men's warehouse thinking it would be an easy accessible place to rent tuxes for our small wedding party of 3 plus the groom when we went in to inquire about rentals we were told that it was cheaper to buy which we thought was weird but we decided to trust the sales associate and buy which ended up costing over $200 per suit after alterations when we bought my husbands suit who was the groom we paid a deposit plus the fee to rent all shirts and ties when our grooms party went in to pick up shirts and ties they were charged for something we had already paid for the best-man was called to pick up his suit saying all alterations were done when in fact the pants weren't even started the tailor job was awful and fit him horrible i'm assuming since they had to rush the hemming we requested all items to be transferred to one store and of course none if it had been leaving us scrambling around town trying to get things together awful customer service no one knew anything when our party came in tried to over charge us when we had our receipts go somewhere else not worth the crappy service crappy tailor job and definitely not worth the stress on your wedding day
0,for 10 minutes to be told there was a sign up list in the corner about 20 feet away in the opposite direction after another 30 minutes of waiting some lady walked up that was not on the list said she was here about 30 mins (i'm at 40 mins now) and the guy started helping her for her sons prom what is the point of the list again
0,we went in for the fitting everything was fine they had to make some adjustments and a button was missing from my best man's jacket no problem they made those corrections and sewed the button back on they also mentioned that they were going to put our pocket squares in for us well they didn't 2 of the 3 of us didn't have pocket squares which were listed on the receipt and on the list of items that should have been included and of course since we had already completed our fitting we didn't notice this until we were getting dressed for the wedding we were told they were being put into our jackets and were let down fortunately we had time to run by a department store and purchase new pocket squares since the wedding wasn't close to a mens wearhouse location but of course that was an added expense we thought we had taken care of also as we're getting dressed my best man's button came right back off again the one that was supposed to be sewed on as the time of the fitting so that was disappointing as well all of the pictures that he is in wearing his jacket look a bit off clearly not everyone will notice it but on a day where i wanted everything to be perfect it wasn't i don't believe for any future tuxedo rentals i'll be returning to a mw as well as i don't believe i'd recommend it i just hope any future grooms or groomsmen don't have the same issues"
0,husband rented a suit for our wedding  a couple days before the wedding he went to pick it up and they had the wrong suit  my husband is 6'2 and they had been shipped a suit for a man who was only 5'10  furthermore their idea of fixing it was giving him a different shirt suit then the one he picked out months ago  the women was extremely rude to me when i told her that i thought that was unacceptable and replied starkly that "mistakes happen"  i told her that it was her responsibility as an employee to fix the mistake  after 45 minutes (if you've ever had a wedding then you know there are a zillion other things you could be doing in 45 minutes three days before the wedding) of her being rude and rolling her eyes at me she finally got her boss to help us  he gave my husband a new shirt (one that was not a rental) and just asked that my husband return it after the wedding which he did  i mean was that really that hard for them to figure out how to make their mistake right
0,read a few negative reviews from other unhappy customers but i thought i would try this place out anyway when i arrived my wife and i met alladin shop owner who seemed very confident he said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about he tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money later i purchased an $800 hugo boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered he made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered a week later i came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing i checked) he didn't ask me to try the right one on so i asked if i could make sure it fit long story short he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off he tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam he finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments he didn't know how to work with the modern hugo boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs  what a joke i was going to seek legal advice but figured i would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work if you need anything complicated done or if you are have anything of value do not use this guy please beware and don't ignore these complaints like i did there are other negative reviews out there if you look
0,payed $70 to get 4 pairs of pants tailored here 3 pairs of bcbg slacks and a pair of true religions so i thought not a bad price for expensive pants and everyone loves this guy not a single one was the right length that i asked the hem fell out of one pair already and the tailor didn't even do what i asked for on another to top it off the chalk marks weren't even washed or steamed out i am so appalled by his craftsmanship i will never go back after i get them fixed
0,took several dresses and shirts in to this person before a long business trip it was very expensive but he seemed competent however on the trip i discovered that one of my dresses wasn't completed and the pins in the shoulders were left in on the phone he offered me a full refund ($40) when i picked up my now completed dress a week later he only offered me a $10 credit and then shooed me out of his store i tore it up right there and vowed never to go back
0,poor customer service - the owner lied to me when i came to pick up my clothing and it wasn't ready that was after calling the night before and getting attitude for inquiring before he originally said it would be ready there's nothing special about this place
0,customer service i went in for the first visit for alterations and they were very standoffish when picking up the pants i noticed the zipper had been broken i brought this to their attention and they refused to fix the zipper or reimburse me for a repair it was obvious that the damage was done at their shop because the pants were brand new also i would not have walked out of the dressing room and proceed to be fitted with a zipper down the owner proceeded to argue with me when i asked him to at least reimburse me for the tailoring and kept this up for about 10 minutes he said he could fix the zipper but out of principle he would not do anything to the pants he said that he had many high end clients and did not need one patron's business  very disappointed will never return
0,read a couple of the negative reviews but decided to get my hugo boss suit altered anyway i was lied to over charged i was given the wrong suit the jacket was not altered when i finally got the right one pants fabric bunched up where alterations were made and to top it off i was treated like it was no big deal i would avoid the guy if you have anything worth value maybe okay for a pair of jeans or sweat pants no apology given after the mess there are too many professionals out there to go to who know what they are doing and who will treat you respectfully so don't go here hopefully this helps you
0,is a problem  i had my phone and keys stolen from me while i was in the pool at dowd  my babysitter had her car broken into in the dowd parking lot as well both of these events took place within the last 2 months  it is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe
0,20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $10 bucks a month for that price i can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the y this place is seriously over sold stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members serious over crowding issue
0,all about the money and really who goes through medical school if its not about the big cash  healing and helping people cannot possibly be the motivationi had my gallbladder removed by dr francis teng my 2 insurances were billed $26000 thankfully (not) my out of pocket was only $320 and $210 to the anesthicialogist who happens to be tengs brother and $35 to rosa teng (office manager) for a one page return to work formmy return visit after the surgery was about 10 seconds long i was still asking him  questions when he was shaking my hand and leading me out of the office rosa his sister and office manager is so rude the word rude doesn't describe how awful this woman is   she is snarky smartass pretentious and full of smartass comments she handles all the insurance and copay fees she will nickle and dime you so be sure you contact your insurance to make sure you get the right coverage and no extra fees  by the way he does single incision surgery he promises no scar well mine healed horribly its what they call a keloid scar and its about and inch long right under my bellybutton  go to a different doctor or ask any medical professional in the las vegas area and everyone seems to agree with the bad bedside manner of dr francis teng and the unprofessional office assistant  rosa
0,in january i had to have my gall bladder removed which was a very unexpected and scary surgery for someone like me who has only ever had my wisdom teeth out i was referred to dr teng's office by a friend of mine who had the weight loss surgery that is his bread and butter i should have waited for the doctor who i was referred to in the er to have an opening but i was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible it was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that dr teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen but at least he got it out and although i now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain i was experiencingi too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which i did and then six months after the surgery i received a sizable bill i couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800 with the er bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine i was not thrilled my husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill when it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it i could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer we wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much after three phone calls my husband had still not heard back from the office yet they continued to send out invoices threatening to slap us with a late payment honestly who does not return phone calls if you are a business it is what you do we were very frustratedfinally my husband got ahold of dr teng's head secretary or office manager who seems to think very highly of herself she was very unhelpful and wouldn't answer his questions besides telling him to contact our insurance provider again what kind of business practice is thiswe paid our bills and hopefully that's the end of it
0,agree with veronika o dr teng's office managersister is the nasiest rudest and most arrogant  person i've dealt with in the medical field it's amazing he still has a practice with the way his office is run even the staff at mountainview hospital don't want to deal with her when i had surgery there and they needed a form from his office they asked me to call because they didn't want to deal with her i also told my family dr never to refer him again there are other surgeons find someone else
0,are lots of businesses that do what they do    i recommended that you do plenty of homework before doing business with neos medspa   they moved to their new location from their mall location for a reason     if you have a problem the doctor that oversees the practice does not call you back     think twice before getting a b12 from them   ask lots of questions and then go find someone else to get one from   it's just not worth the risk
0,people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us  we had rented a limobus for a bachelor party  our driver scott was completely clueless in navigating the city constantly making wrong turns and missing exits all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence this caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops after returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs really  why  how  we found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused by this point we decided to call it a night more than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong as we enter the highway we realize that scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going the wrong way  he starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us  truly terrifying after that we were very upset and just wanted to get home so after several more wrong turns we finally get home absolutely terrible night so if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver unecessary police involvement a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys otherwise i would suggest staying far far away
0,you have any common sense at all please don't stay here  once it almost burnt downand i'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting "burn baby burn"
0, this place should be ashamed of itself  do not stay here  beyond dirty just absolutely rank
0,who wrote the review below a big fat liarsomeone that was paid to write that i stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and i were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home) this place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s literally there was grime on the walls and squashed unwiped bug smears too ok so not the best but for two hours we could deal we looked for bed bugs and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest after about 20-30 minutes we both started itching like crazy i ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders arms and legs horrible please health department shut them down it's deplorable in there
0,can't even rate this place its absolutely disgusting i begged the health department to shut them down i was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body just filthy do not stay here
0,i could give negative stars i would after this review i'm writing the president of aa and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location i will never be a aaa member again (been one since 1999) i recently moved from tn and needed to transfer my title and register my dodge ram in pa  this process is costly regardless of where you go but adding $36+ for every transaction makes aaa the most expensive  i'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me but aaa has made it worse than going to the dmv  each and every clerk at this location is incompetent uneducated and aloof i should know i've dealt with at least a dozen go to the dmvfor my very simple transaction i've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is seven) times and it still is not resolved they've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder issued the wrong plate for my vehicle neglected to inform me of steps required by the state i mean seriously why would you pay $36 for each visit just to get it wrong go to the dmvwhy did you return there if you were so unhappy you might ask  well once you begin the process at one branch you cannot transfer to any other branch (we went to monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes once) go to monroeville or cancel your aaa membership and go to the dmvoh and 30 minutes that's a dream i'm waited between 45 minutes and 35 hours at the east liberty aaa prepare to take the day of work nay the week in order to complete any transaction at this facility go to the dmvit has now been over 5 months since i started this process and it's still up in the air they don't know what i still need to do but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out  save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just go to the dmv yeah it might seem sterile and slow but at least they aren't serial criminals it'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the east liberty aaaoh and if you think this is a harsh review call their number 412-365-7196 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings once i timed it for more than 30 minutes before i got an answer (with no apology)  if you are in the aaa you'll know i'm calling  it's the constant ring in the background that nobody answers
0,really wanted to like this place great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea the pictures on the website are beautifulwe found a grumpy old man at the front desk and he could not have been less interested in our arrival it felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key but the fun started when we returned later in the evening we found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present and i went back down to the old gentleman he stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer i waited suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not he also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollawayi slunk away with my guest who had by now come down too embarrassed and insulted it shouldn't be this way if this is personalized service i'd rather stay at a moteleven without grumpy old man there's nothing special about this place the rooms were ok but the bathrooms tiny (i guess they should be called showerrooms) everything else was sub-par the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful we did not dare try the free wine the hotel is in a bad neighborhoodfor the money find a special at the william penn on the omni hotels website if you want a boutique hotel try the inn on the mexican war streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the national aviary and that beautiful park the priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hasslepriory get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role
0,stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town our first impression was that pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area i find out later is one of the worst spots in the city)  the hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building  projects  ugh  great  then we were put into a "historical" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall moldy threadbare carpeting lumpy squeaky bed  i find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated  i asked to see the room and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee of course  about 50% more expensive  but i pay more because no way would i be able to exist in this old "historical" creepy room  finally a regular room-- the "renovated" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room  why even keep this historical old dingy dirty room  do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it bc they have no other choice i slept well in the "new" renovated room and would have been freaked out all night in the old room what a difference actually the bed and linens were very very comfortable  the bathroom was nice and clean  the room was what i expected a hotel room to be not high end four seasons but not cheap and nasty either the hotel obviously had availabilities of the new renovated rooms so why put us in an old unrenovated ugly old apartment looking room if they believed in upgrading then they would have at least gotten repeat business for those who are going to book here pay more for the new rooms or go somewhere else  the option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all  i don't think i will ever go back here if i ever go back to pittsburgh  i will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever  what is money except a means to be comfortable and live  i will spend more next timebreakfast was "eh"  it was free-- small stations of some fruit cheese small pastries cereal yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon  oj cranberry milk and coffee also available  honestly i felt like i was in college and watching my pennies (poor) staying here
0,at a beautiful wedding  staff was terrible unpleasant and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills  nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the "people" at the priory are cold miserable and just plain miserable i get better guest service at holiday inn
0,decided to have a little staycation at the priory earlier this month  my husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night  with the special they give you a few pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant  when my husband called the priory they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time  we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying  but the main issue was we checked in talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at meat and potatoes and she set us up with the shuttle  we go in the room look around for the $50 voucher and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with meat and potatoes when they  made our reservation  we had a fabulous dinner at m&p great food great service and the bill comes  we asked the server about this priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out  we called the priory and told them this the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it  then refused to call m&p to talk to the manager  she just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel  we gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this  he took our word that the priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill  it was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money just the service with the priory  this showed us two things: we won't be going back to the priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we will be going back to m&p because their service was impeccable
0,was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in my hubby and i  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that i wanted to throw up i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed in the morning at 5am i wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up i felt so dirty that i took two showers at other hotel i never thought that i will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel
0,never been to pittsburgh before and i planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so i booked this hotel the day before i drove up i saw the reviews & ignored them because i figured i'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bedi checked in around 2am the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides "initial here and sign here and your room is over there" the room smelt like hot dogs the ac wasn't working at all so i was dripping in sweat all night none of the lamps worked at all there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet i went down for the continental breakfast at 9:30am (it ends at 10am) and they already stopped serving the shower was ice cold i then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole i spent the night in last night (coast is clear) i checked out and went back to baltimore which seems like heaven on earth compared to shittsburgh
0,bugs horrible place do not stay here stayed here for a wedding we attended woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs arms and back we flip a pillow over and there it was bed bugs we had to cut our trip short the man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning we have been calling since 810 and have yet to receive a call back such disrespect we risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back
0,used to be the holiday inn and now it is the clarion hotel & conference center  we needed to find a place not too far from heinz stadium for a reasonable price we paid about $90 per night for this place and the experience started poorly we walked in and the two lobby tvs were tuned to judge judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure) employees watching reality tv during business hours really puts me off it was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order  two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings it was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions to the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order my wife pointed out her extreme cleavage but i did not want to get lost there we had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room she tended to mumble but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions we finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor in a way i felt as if we were at some sort of slum i kept looking for gang tagging the room was adequate (and i believe this was a renovated room) but a motel 6 would be an upgrade whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible the swimming pool was a swamp (i am not kidding) but i am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time the next morning we went down to the front desk again this time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that i was interrupting her call  she did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side answered my question and then continued her conversation personally i think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and hollywood should contact this place it needs to be knocked down or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality if construction is on track (and i suspect something is wrong) get staff that really is gracious to customers there are people that need jobs out there and i assure you with proper management they will do a great job don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered) personally i would not stay here until they fix the place but for some reason i don't feel that it will ever happen something just feels wrong perhaps clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy
0,lol so seriously i read some reviews about this place and was like noooo it can't be that bad ha hadude so this spot is like mad cheap but really first we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations checkin was seamless as it should be we get to out room 122 and after reading the reviews i know to check the beds immediately the first bed legit has hair under the sheetsstrike 1 as i'm pulling the covers back on the second bed i find two quartersthat's right folks obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the sheets haven't been changedlet alone checked i mean really you couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobswe go to the desk and make them aware of the issue they apologetically get us another room this room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned the elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs thank god for yelpyou've all been warned lol seriously
0,was technically the clarion hotel so i think the name is wrong on the page i'd like to start by saying that i'm not much of a complainer but if could have given 0 stars i would have so we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it i assumed it was leaking and brushed it off i don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there after a great hockey game and a bar crawl we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed there was absolutely no hot water for my shower so cold i wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick it was late so i let it go and decided to try again in the morning when i woke up it was the same thing at this point i was fuming i need a shower manso i put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor "what the hell" is pretty much what i was thinking at this point well there was my shower considering i had to walk through it to continue on my quest as soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor i see the hallway is flooded the carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in i was so mad i managed to get 70% off our bill and i made her call to check us in at another hotel i would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but i'm really bad at being mean to people all in all i will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again
0,checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like moldy ceilings  musty smells unclean rooms and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99% thank god hotwire gave us a refund
0, it's a ghost town needles in parking lot "lobby" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around asked to see our rooms before checking in given the key room was filthy  saw a sticky note re: bedbugs  bolted as fast as possible
0,not sure i can even give this place one star to be fair the room we had was clean and comfortable it did seem as if we had entered a time warp though furnishings and bedding from the 70'sif not 60's i've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites i'd like to know their qualificationswhen you first approach the hotel it looks closed down (and write obviously it should be) you enter through a side entrance with hand written signs the"office" is a room right inside the doors the hallway looks a wreck (oh yeahthey're under construction) dirt filth and stains everywhere electrical wires exposed smoke detectors hanging down you look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes (or are they hmmmm)like i saidthe room was betteralthough not without faults the lights over the bathroom sink did not work and the shower did not work well the tv was definitely a 1980's model wireless internet what a joke when we reported the bathroom issues they said they would move us to another room since we were only staying 2 nights we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning we were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow (our ever)we told the lady working the "front desk" that this hotel was pretty scary her reply was " yeah we get that a lot"
0,yes what has yet to be said about this clarion in greentree which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction check the reviews folks (i sure wish i had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four yearsmy family and i'm sure countless others initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby doubletree hotel but even with directions we drove right past the clarion because: 1) there are no hotel signs; 2) we were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3) there were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4) the entire front of the building was boarded upwhen we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone which once represented the entrance to the hotel we saw a tiny sign directing us to the "temporary lobby" in the back of the hotel the makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk the clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer but found it as soon i had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation emailwe were given a room on the second floor thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine until we located the elevator well let me tell you folks disney's tower of terror ride is less frightening than this elevator it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees the floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floorwhen we got to our room the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on we did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets but thankfully no bugs we also checked for the free wi-fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation)finding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways the adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night) i then realized that i had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining areathere was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about complementary breakfast and the strange phrase "gratuity included" but inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'tip jars' now i've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels but i've never seen a tip jar in the dining room i've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off but there were drop cloths power tools and all sorts of debris everywherewhen i got in line for the grub i learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food the person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage adding "because clarion cares about your health" i'm not kidding (who could make something like that up) anyway i tried this so-called health food because the only other hot alternative was french toast and i did not want any syrupy food that morning guess what the sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup real healthy right thus i ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up the coffee was okay by the wayin conclusion i would not have stayed at the greentree clarion had i not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day plus we used our loyalty points for this room so i couldn't even request a discountbelieve me hud would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the dept of homeland security would never even consider housing immigrants there but of course you and i are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there
0,was by far the worst hotel experience i've ever had it wasn't just that there was massive construction going on but they did nothing to accommodate for it they put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings spackle and sheetrock everywhere the lights were broken and the room was filthy the second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet rendering it useless in the middle of the summer had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor the children working the front desk which was located in a hotel room gave the worst customer service greeted me with an attitude and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner the worst do not stay here
0,i could give this place negative stars where to begin it begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at and then it goes into their "temporary lobby" which is a room turned into an office the whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad but my gosh they have crap everywhere that leads us to the elevator norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him it's marked with two different hotel names on top of that holiday inn and ramada then the room not the worst of the worst the decor is nice the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed really wish i would have looked at yelp before booking here buyer beware oh yea and i knew they were under construction before we booked in june and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand extremely disappointed
0,was at the visulite saturday night and it was a terrible experience i bought tickets online 2 days prior to the show it was listed as a headliner and that the doors opened at 8pm with 2 opening acts we got there right on time and were denied entrance jam base had listed it as one show and when i bought tickets on the visulite website it was for 1 show we were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later what then we were told "it was made very clear on the website" at which point the guy whipped out his clip board and showed us some piece of paper and was like "don't make me pull up the website" if it was made so clear why were we having this discussion to say the least the guy takingselling tickets was a jerk and the door guy was a total bully he not only told said "are you talking about my ticket guy in there you better watch yourself or you won't be coming back" really first of all i'm a hard working polite female that does not deserve to be bullied around by some oaf that thinks his job is that important to keep squirrely little girls like me out of there what am i going to do kick him in the shins tell him he's a meanie there are better ways to handle a situation second i was not talking back to this guy or arguing i was trying to figure out why on earth i would have to buy separate tickets for 1 nights worth of music at the same venue we ended up going to crown station (which is an awesome spot with very nice people) and headed back in time for the show again the door guy was a bully saying "looks like you came back for a 2nd try huh you better watch yourself this time" to say the least i asked the bartender to speak to a manager and apparently there was not one there on this particular evening i have to say the bartender was extremely nice and apologized about 3 times over this used to be my favorite venue in charlotte to see music but after this terrible experience i will not be returning i remain very upset about this situation and can't imagine the band would be very happy knowing their fans are being bullied and talked down to at the front door as for the sound once we finally made it in it was extremely loud and impossible to hear any words that the guys were actually singing super bummed about the whole evening but would also be very willing to talk to a manager
0,hated this place  it might have just been a bad time but i doubt i'll ever go backi arrived and found a seat outside so as to smoke  i go in and get a pbr it's loud there's a dj i'm happy to be outside  i got pestered by a waitress a few times while sitting outside but i can't really complain about that since she was kind and was trying to help us out  i had two beers and was ready to leave when i went to the bathroom  on my way there i got punched in the face accidentally by some chick that was dancingwhen i woke up the next morning i got a call from my bank about a $25 charge at cowboy monkey to my account  i checked the receipt in my pocket and sure enough: it was a $5 bill  turns out they take a $25 "hold" out on your card when you open a tab to make sure the card is good  the catch though is you don't get your money back for a few days  i'm still out $20 to them three days later  i paid $25 for two bottles of pbr at this pointso to sum it up i got punched in the face by an enthusiastic dancer and got way overcharged  so i'm not too pleased with the place
0,left after the bar tender insulted my friend i can see having a bad night but do not take it out on your customers to top off our bad experience this place steals your money we asked for our check after dealing with the offensive bar tender and wrote no tip on the tip line later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a $5 tip that is not ok
0,this place like they serve salmonellaour dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember  we sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show upi ordered what the waiter claimed was their "signature" dish paella latorre  it was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm  i called over the waiter and explained  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had "re-heated" it  while the plate was hot the food was still tepid  i called the waiter over again and told him  he argued that he "saw" the chef reheat the food  by this time my business associate had almost completed his meal so i ate as much as i could and left about 13we told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check  he returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do  we called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he would dothe following week i contacted blerim meta the general manager of this restaurant as well as "aquavina"  he has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experienceavoid this restaurant  avoid aquavina
0,was so excited to try the pupusas after reading the reviews but all the hype didn't reflect my experiencelocated in a bright blue building it was very unassumingwe entered through the back into a dimly lit but very clean dining area  the menu sounded good and had photos of everything to make it easy to choose  my daughter and we ordered the plato tipico to get an idea of what they had to offer   the tamale smelled and tasted of funky fish (i think it was actually pork and potato) with under cooked masa there were beef empanadas deep fried hard things that i think were potato and the bean and cheese pupusaseverything tasted of the oil it was cooked in and was very bland  the cabbage slaw accompaniment was of no help in adding flavor  i also had the horchata which was very good  we tried ordering a dessert however after taking our order the server came back several minutes later to tell us they were out so we ordered something else only to be told later they were out of that too  finally we ordered the pork bean and cheese pupusas to give one more tryit was very cheesey but bland with an odd meat taste  overall a very disappointing experience
0,have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work and i must say that the first time i was there the service was slow and the food mediocre  the last two times i went there it was not by my choice but by group consensus  the food is also mediocre at best having a friend whose mother is from el salvador this food was terrible absolutely terrible in comparison  the beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water 1 part hot sauce  each time i went there i called ahead and placed my order and i had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min to wait for my food (after ordering ahead)  i brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant and they told me in their exact words it's not their problem and if i had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer they have many more waiting  i don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly  i have been overcharged and never received items that i have ordered that were still on my check and i had to argue with the owner  it is by far the worst service i have ever received in this city  about 5 people i work with have all sworn to never return to this store
0,of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas with that said the owner took our order and she was rude not friendly at all1 she get the order wrong2 she food was kind of cold3 seen like she didn't want to be there (she is the owner) found out she was the when i was paying the bill4 she was trying to over charge the bill postings images of bill  5 she never told us about the drinks weren't free refills 6 got mad when i pointed out that the bill was added wrong 7 slam the bill on the table when she corrected it even my girlfriend who is calm was shocked8 when the bill the guy owner said sorry for the bad servicewhen noticed i not happy
0,a big fan of family owned restaurants especially ethnic so you can only imagine my excitement when i found a peruvian restaurant here in the desert  sad to say this is one restaurant i will not be returning tothe food was bland and lacked flavor  it almost like they ran out of "all spices" right before we ordered (yes including salt and pepper)  to start of we ordered an appetizer the papa a la huancaina sliced boiled potato served at room temperature covered with a cold bland bright boldish yellowish colored hollandaisemayonnaise sauce let's just say it was a start to a bad mealfor the main course we ordered the lomo saltado generous chunks of beef sauted with onions tomatoes and potatoes which sad-to-say was probably the best dish we had  the dish was uninspiring something you could find at a sit-down chain restaurant   nothing about the dish screamed central american flavorswe also had the jalea a combination of breaded octopus shrimp and chunks of fish fillet topped with a peruvian salsa (aka your standard chunky and fresh pico de gallo (tomatoes onions cilantro and lime juice)) i have never in my life had something that was breaded and deep-fried so soggy in my life  the breading was heavy and disgusting  it also came with the worst plantains i've ever had  dry overcooked and extremely chewy  put it this way i've had better plantains at bahama breeze then this place (yes i said bahama breeze)i am not trying to pick on this place  i swear  but when the owner's brother helps you order and tells you what they are known for and what they make best and they miss horribly  well needless to say i can only imagine what there non-staple dishes taste likenot to beat up on these nice folks too much  they place was cute  the place was painted in a vibrant yellowishbrownish mustard type color which gave the place a warm and bright feel  on one wall was a mural of what was to resemble a village in peru  the other wall was a collection of trinkets from the native land and of course the flag of peru  the servers were extremely nice  beware when you order water they bring out bottled (and charge you) so if you want tap you need to ask and depending on your spanish or their lack of english that may be a challenge i hate to say this because the place was quaint and the help was friendly but if you have a craving for central american andor peruvian food don't waste your money or time here i'm just going to wait till the next time i'm back east in ny or dcnorthern va to get real and tasty peruvian food and i would suggest you do the same
0,here with our family and there are only 5 of us ordered pupusas and fried plantain it took a while before the food came out this place is a hole in a wall but we were willing to try it out because of the good reviews here we got our foodplantain was good the shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork it was alrighthad better  we got the bill and noticed that they already included the gratuity coming from vegas i have no problem paying gratuity but for it to be included on the bill for 5 people  that's unheard of so i came up to the cashier to inquire about it one of the girl from the cashier pulled out the menu and said "that's our rulesix people or more we have to include gratuity" so i stood there a little confused until i came back to our table and my sis reminded me that there are only 5 of us so i went back and asked the cashier that there were only 5 of us so she shouldn't include the gratuity then all of a sudden both girls that were in the cashier counter said that the rule was changed to 4 people mind youthis is within 2-3 minutes time frame their rules changed from 6 people to 4 people when i asked why they did not mention earlier that it was changed from 6 to 5she kept on saying "call the manager" and was saying this rudely
0,costumer service walk up to the counter and stood there for a bit then finally a lady asks me to have a seat and someone will be with mewaited and then another group of guys come in sit down on the table next to us and finally a lady comes to help but completely ignores my family and helps the group of guys and thats when we walk out no need to spend my money on a place like that
0,a bit longer of a drive than we normally make for lunch our office lunch crew wanted something different so we decided to try and find a cuban place and came across this one which got us all excitedwhen we arrived we were unimpressed by the exterior but figured plenty of dives have awesome foodwe were seated fairly quickly in some beautifullawn chairs  the chairs were the cheap plastic chairs you use when you havee guests in your backyard and don't give a crap about their comfort  the atmosphere was tacky and unimpressivei ordered a chicken sandwich special as i didn't see any torta one the menu (what respectable cuban place doesn't have a simple torta on their menu)  the sandwhich was dry and flavorless and tasted as if it received no seasoning at all  my companions all looked at their food after tasting it and were disappointed as wellreceiving a refill on a water was like asking the government to stop spending money it just wasn't going to happenhorrible experience bland food overpriced  in short never going back and don't recommend it to anyone
0,going backthis was my second time here wasn't that impressed the first time but thought i'll give it another look more because one of the guys in our team really wanted to go here food: just ok over-priced and very small portions came out hungry deserts are quite niceservice: i think i would have given this place 2 12 stars was it not for the bad service very rude waiter i am not going to go into details of what happenned at our table but suffice to say i left the place pissed never going back and nor is the guy in our team who really wanted to go in the first placei think i hate a rude (and i mean rude not bad) service more that bad food bad food just leaves me with no feelings but a rude server leaves me pissed

0,2518-6167i am seeking a refund for my voucher to havana cafe last night i went to havana cafe when we entered the restaurant the hostess approached us and asked us if we had a reservation we told her we did not and she said that they were booked up but we could eat in the bar there were at least 6 tables open it wasn't our first choice but we said okay we sat in the bar and the waitress took our drink order after about 20 minutes the bar tender asked if our orders had been taken we said no and he asked if he could get an appetizer started for us we ordered our appetizers and waited for the waitress to come take our dinner order while we waited some other people came in and we heard them say that a 10-15 minute wait for a table was not too long we asked them if they had a reservation and they said no they just came in a couple at the table next to us said they too had been told they couldn't eat in the dining room while my friend went tell the waitress that we wanted a table a waiter came to the table with 2 appetizers he tried to give me the wrong one and i told him that the other one was ours he walked away with both appetizers i and someone at the table next mine tried to call him back but he kept going the waitress finally came to take our orders the appetizer waiter again came by with our appetizer and walked past our table twice the waitress had to stop him and tell him to give it to us we were finally moved to a table and waited for our food when the food finally came they brought all of the food at the same time instead of bringing my friends salad before the entree also my salad was nothing like what was listed on the menu and had ingredients that i am allergic to i told the waiter that this was not the entree salad that i ordered and that i was allergic to some of the ingredients at this point we asked to speak with the manager after 10 minutes of watching the manager come in and out of the dining room going around to talk to people at other tables we asked for the manager again our entrees were brought out to us they brought the exact same salad to me and my friend's entree had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp the waiter said that he would get the menu so he could show me that it was the right salad the manager still hadn't come to us so my friend went to him from across  the room i could see from his body language that the manager was not in any way responsive to our issues when my friend returned to the table she told me that he was rude to her until she mentioned that she knew the owner the manager then came to our table when we brought up the fact that my salad was nothing like anything on the menu and the fact that when we told the waiter that i was allergic to some of the unlisted ingredients he apologized and said that sometimes the chef changes the ingredients and the menu isn't changed i explained that this could be life threatening for some people  he offered to have the salad remade but at this point i was not confident in their care for allergy issues and declined after 2 hours in the restaurant we left without eating the manager did end up giving us gift certificates for a return visit - it is highly unlikely that i will return
0,place has turned me off of cuban food terrible decor old hot not enough air conditioning i guess and the paellaplease over cooked smooshy cold vegetables almost all rice with no saffron favor ands terrible seafoodcan't even get the crab out of crab legs because they are so soft and cold terrible i hope this place goes out of business because at these pricesi wouldn't normally say that butshame on you for serving this these other reviews are from the staff no doubt about it try it and then thank melater for warning you
0,houronly 2 tables with clients and i still had to wait 4-5 minutes to get somebody to come out and offer me a table  $17 lunch plus $3 tip for a waitress with no personality carne ensebolllada was less than ok will not be coming back maybe an off day but honestly fast food started to sound better specially for a $20 lunch
0,signed up with yelp just to write this review my wife and i moved to az recently and we were happy to find a place which sold cuban and puerto rican food all the dishes we ordered were disgusting  the fried meat (carne frita) that she ate was dry and flavorless the mofongo she had was unlike any other we have ever tried she asked me to try and i just couldn't swallow it we both love mofongo so that was very disappointing it doesn't end there my dish was the puerto rican plate so i was excited and thought it would bring back some memories of my hometown but it only brought back nightmares the rice with pigeon peas (arroz con gandules) had way too much tomato sauce i can go on forever but would rather not i will just jump to the desert we thought maybe since the meal was so horrible maybe they could redeem themselves with an awesome flan when we ordered the flan the waitress said they did not have the large portion but she  could give us the two smaller portions we said ok but to our surprise the flan was so pale and the taste was so bland i looked at it carefully and noticed that it had the recycling symbol on it who does that  come on really  i'm done with this place i would never eat at this restaurant even if they paid me i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless i hated them
0,made a special trip to go to the havana cafe to buy food for my mother who was just put into hospice care imagine my surprise when i arrived at 3:30pm and was told that i could not order off the lunch menu because the kitchen was switching to dinner service i pointed out that the front door has a sign stating lunch is served until 4pm the hostess got the manager who refused to allow me to order off the lunch menu i suggested they change their lunch hour to end at 3:30 instead of 4pm so this wouldn't happen to anyone else as far as the food i am hispanic and my food makes this food taste like fast food i only went there for convenience what a huge disappointment
0,will not be going back because the owner would not honor my $15 groupon  my waitress asked her 2 times and she said no  there are plenty of great places in north scottsdalethis is not one of them
0,is very unfortunate that there is only one colombian restaurant in las vegas and this one is not a good example of our gastronomy  what i really dislike about this place is the inconsistency  one day food might be good but the next it will be terrible; customer service is very bad and sometimes they dare to serve old old foodi do love their empanadasthey are pretty goodlas vegas needs a good colombian restaurant and not this mediocre place
0,food here is always good but unless your hispanic count on getting terrible service  i am regular customer because the food and the owner are absolutely amazing however the waitress today was rude and condescending  i felt rushed as she was taking my order she was weeded with 3 tables including us and she had a runner  30 minutes to get appetizer that were pre made empanadas that i had previously asked for 3 times and she kept saying they were coming  next time i will order my food to go ad avoid the rude condescending and dismissive service  food is 5 stars but service was  terrible i hate to write bad reviews especially for an establishment i love so much but she has to learn to be more hospitable  restaurants survive on returning customers and service can make a lasting impression
0,keep telling myself to give this poor place another chance but unfortunately i went again on december 2013 and the service was horrible and the food as usual not good at all whenever there is any latinos in town or colombians i highly do not recommend this place at all since i do not want to make any enemiesif you are craving colombian food go to los angeles there is quite a few places there that are authentic and deeeelicious the decor is horrendous i feel like i'm in a cave someplace
0,a colombian living in la and lv wanted to some traditional colombian food only to be turned away by bad service and little attention there's only two waitresses for the whole restaurant and one cook both to busy to even notice my family and i sitting and waiting when we called one of them over they rudely told is that it'd be 45 minutes before we could be helped left and never coming back sad that this is the only colombian restaurant in town
0,i go here it seems the portions get smaller and more expensive the staff is poorly trained and the food always comes out cold too bad there isn't any other colombian restaurants in las vegas i went there today hoping it would get better  but it just gets worse i wouldn't recommended anyone going here
0,terribleoverpriced tipical colombian place but the food not good enough the service really bad slow and poor they can offerd more because they can't
0,to be fair i didn't actually stay to sample the food i can only think of a handful of times i have actually walked out of a restaurant in which i intended to eat at unfortunately this was one of them this is why:my fiance and i bought a deal over a year ago on restaurantscom to try out this place we were actually really excited to give columbian food a try but for whatever reason hadn't gotten around to using our coupon we finally decided to just make a plan and go for it we looked over the menu and were really looking forward to coming here we were expecting a little hole in the wall with simple but tasty food and maybe that is what we would have gotten on a different day unfortunately the day we went two major red flags were present 1 when we walked in a handful of people were sitting in the "front" room which is basically a convenience store front with a few tables we weren't offered a seat in this room rather the hostess walked us to the larger back room- where the lights were turned off she told us they were off because they were trying to cool the restaurant down- there is no air conditioning in the building we arrived at 6:00 pm on a wednesday it didn't seem as though they were expecting customers 2 the second we walked in my fiance and i both instantly noticed that the entire building wreaked of sewage the smell could not be ignored sorry but if the place i'm going to eat at smells like waste i don't have confidence in your sanitary practices i've never been in a restaurant that smelled and we immediately left the health department might want to drop in for an inspection
0,yelp hides reviews written in spanish or sends them to the bottom  being that this restaurant is a latin restaurant where most clients speak spanish i wrote my review in spanish but here's my review in englishthree times i have received bad food  i would never recommend this place to anyone for salvadorean foodi tried to give the place a chance but after three times of the same bad food i just decided its best to let gothe chicken or fish dinner plates are horrible  the meat itself is dry and it seems they are not fresh  when these complaints are brought to the staffs and subsequently to the owners attention they simply are indifferent and do nothing to resolve the problemthe last time i ordered to go and was so angry after i got home and discovered a poorly cooked and tasting fried fish gross i immediately called and over the phone the owner offered to refund the money or another replacement dinner the following day as they were closing for the night so i was without dinner that night and had to put something simple and quick at home the next day and the following days after nobody wanted to do good on their word of giving me a replacement dinner even though the owner claimed he would leave a note to inform his staff in charge  i didn't even want my money but after a few days i demanded a refund and it was then that they offered to replaced the fish the fish only because they felt that was the only thing that was not to par  seriouslylol i laughed at their lack of professionalism  who buys a dinner plate just for one of the items a dinner plate is made up of all the items on it to provide you with a delicious eating experience that means the salad the rice as well  so that day they only gave me a fish lol i felt that i was transported to el salvador a third world country  certainly thats the only place where they would think this to be good business practicethey're a joke the food is horrible the chicken and fish is not fresh even the second fish was in the same condition  one of the waitresses even made a comment that's how they do things she even suggested ordering pupusas as they tend to have less issues with that some times  only because you are a latin restaurant that doesn't mean you have to provide a substandard service  there are many other latin restaurants that do a great job  this place needs to take notes from them
0,service i felt like i was treated like the ugly adopted child here first they got my order wrong and didn't do anything about it the horchata had a nasty burnt after taste pupusas were mehh then they took foreverrrrr to bring our desert seriously forever my testicles were beginning to collect dust and to top it off one of the flan deserts was burnt its not over ladies and gentlemen then our check was wrong too i won't ever be coming back here for sure
0,this place i had some beef tacos and they have to be the worst i've ever had in my life i have never seen taco meat like this it looked like they first boiled a steak and then chopped it with a claw hammer and seasoned it only with black peppermy wife had the steak buritto and encountered the same lousy beef i went to this place because i was nearby and a yelper had given it 5 stars i can't even imagine how drunk this person must have been to give it 5 stars did i already say avoid this place
0,got a pedicure here not bad they were pretty thorough but two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway) i hate to rate a local shop down but man my toes hurt
0,away the owners are so rude they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in pittsburgh they make you feel so unwelcome advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair  it was so awkward and weird   i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet  i may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate but this place gives me the creeps sounds dirty and has beyond bad customer service  they definitely do not know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well sue and kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients  i have never experienced a ruder salon or should i say dead beat shack
0,think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients  i was all ready to be a new client  i had a 12:30 appointment with them and when i arrived at 12:30 on the dot the place was locked and dark and no one was there  i waited for five minutes (in the rain) and they still didn't show  i called and left a voicemail saying that i was still willing to wait and i understood if there was some confusion but could they call my cell (i gave them the number as i had previously given my home number when i made the appointment)  i waited nearby at a coffee shop went back after another five minutes and it was still locked and i hadn't received a call  and i am definitely not estimating the time either  i was willing to wait a bit and i looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that i wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving  finally i went on with my day and when i got home they had left a voicemail on my home phone which i had specifically asked them not to call saying "oh hi  sorry you missed me but i was maybe two minutes late at the most  i hope you haven't left but you should just call back to reschedule'  seriously  when i was waiting another woman came to the door  i thought she worked there but she was just another client also trying to get in  when i told this story at another local business the women there said that i was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place  i couldn't believe it  this place is the worst and i have never even stepped inside
0,i'm picky about my hair but mane attractions was so bad that i walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clientsi had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers  first the girl at the counter said my hair might be "difficult" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that i would probably have to stand while it was cut  weird but okay  second no one there knew anything about donating to "locks of love" and i feel like salons should be aware of things like that  i needed a cut so i went for it anywayi watched the two stylists while i waited for my turn  one stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it "wasn't looking right"  ummm okay  the other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplashat that point i just pretended like i had received an urgent text and said "i have to leave so sorry "as i bolted for the door
0,i'd give supercuts a shot since giant eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks  i don't remember her name but she is one of the "bigger" woman there  i wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy  so i asked her for a trim to get the sidesback cleaned up  she said ok and off she goes  5 minutes later we were done   yes just like a bad date we were done in 5 minutesi got home showered and saw the damage  it was messy  what's worst is every day it grows it looked even worsti'll just stick to my usual barber
0,wish i could return a haircutunfortunately kelly melissa and jen were not there so i settled for whoever was free at the time worst trim of my life:she cut off over an inch more than just the deadsplit endsshe did not cut the hair how i described initiallyshe did not change the cut to how i repeated during the cut when i noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back which does not mix well with my curly hairafter retelling her how i wanted it cut she compared this tragedy to deaths of familyfriends and how i should get over itthe beautiful long layers i had and wanted again are now choppy medium layersmy left side is even choppier than the right side of my hairi fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evidenti regret tipping her because i understand how the service industry works because my minimum tip of 20% for all service people is undeserved for her lack of worki want everyone to know how the only good hair stylists there are kelly (who moved to philly) melissa and jen if they are not available do not risk goingalso the supercuts oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color therewhile it was a $20 cut (after the 20% tip) i know had to buy biotin to grow my hair faster so it is more expensive to me in the end i hope this proves helpful to all perspective customers
0,i got a haircut here once and hated it but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes it never did look right so i just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people i didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it as i highly doubted that i'd get any money refunded and i certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it i then figured hey this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing right right but their service is so bad that i gave up on that too -- i got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble but the last time i went in i had called ahead to put my name in and was told that i would be next on the list and to show up in about 20 min my house is a 20 min walk from there perfect i headed out got there in 20 min and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her i'd called ahead there was one man sitting there waiting who i had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me the "stylist" was just finishing up a haircut so i should have been next right since i had put my name in before the guy who walked in nope she called him over and i said "sorry i think i was next i called ahead and was told i'd be next in line" and the lady said "oh we don't do that" wtf you told me very clearly that you do exactly that what craziness is this so i waited figuring that i'd already invested 20 min into this venture so i may as well stick it out and waited and waited while one "stylist" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing) they must have been "on break" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic because i sat there waiting for another full 20 min and when i finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows the 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over very annoyed at my presence and the woman doing the haircut said "after i'm done here" and i sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving will never go back
0,went there today the cut was terrible i have an awful experience they lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head
0,sothe search for a new hair salon continues sigh don't get me wrong the cut was a good cut the salon itself was clean and stylish the owner welcoming and friendly now what went wrong the cut was good but it certainly wasn't what i expected from a salon with the reputation of izzazu i wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either don't diss my previous stylistshe rockedyou don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else  (and come on i was waaayyyy overdue for a cut since i've been driving to cleveland for a style)  that being said for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas tolls lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal but when i started to sign the charge slip it said $65 not $55 "but" i said "the website said it was $55 for a master stylist" "oh" the chick at the counter said "that's for men's cuts" silly me so when i got back to the office i went online and checked nope it said $55 for a master stylist women's haircut hmmmmm so i called the chick at the counter now said "oh our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut should be" what so i quoted the prices to her from the izzazu website she changed her tune again "oh welli'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number" didn't she have my slip with the card number "sorry i don't give my credit card number over the phone" "or i can send you a gift certificate" "nope" i said through clenched teeth "i won't be coming back"it wasn't the cut it was the bait and switch i'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time as judge judy says "don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining" the search goes on or i'll be back in cleveland in the spring for the next cutp s  one amusing side note:  i checked in at izzazu when i arrived  turns out i'm the duchess  the duchess is displeased
0,the professionalism of the front desk never got better  despite emilio's assurances that changes were being made my latest visit proved otherwise  i called ahead and was assured that marshall was on timein fact he didn't have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as i got there  i was there a few minutes before my appointment  i waited  and waited  fifteen minutes later i asked if marshall knew i was waiting  i was told by the brunette that they had been busy  odd she the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while  she went back to notify marshall  when marshall came up front to get me the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients - she shouldn't have to notify him that his appointment is there  wow  and the purpose of a receptionist iswhat  i'm done  i'm out  apparently nothing will help izzazu's but getting rid of the front desk staff  on a positive note it was another great cut  not good enough to lure me back though
0,facial with lulu used a groupon and thought it may be why she was so terribly unattentive but realized she had no idea what i was paying with basically i got the 'steam machine' blowing on my face for 40 min  would give negative stars if i could
0,had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when i turned up they told me that the person i had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me they made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel to make things worse the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude here's a tip when you are in the beauty salon business staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually been to a salon not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago will never go back
0,and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself i was put on hold twice and never picked back up emails went unanswered  :(i was going to have so much done too hair cut color with highlights spa manicurepedicure and an hour massage all as a graduation present to myself but if they can't be attentive to prospective customers then i can't imagine that they'd be attentive in the store i'll spend my money elsewhere
0,experience literally unbelievable i waited 50 minutes and finally walked out receptionists were beyond awful i booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding one person was taken right away 20 minutes later the second person was taken  i waited 50 minutes while being ignored by the receptionists  i can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late my stylist finally came out and said he'd quickly do my hair what  i'm not paying $100 to get rushed service we were looking forward to a relaxing fun experience more unbelievable i waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services one receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party  i was so close to walking out and not paying unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own i can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as i am still furious in the way i was treated  i would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style i could never recommend izzazu denham & company is on market square their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the fairmont i am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience
0,customer service is absolutely horrible they made me wait an hour before anybody got to me and there were 3 available beauticians in the back i complained and got waited on right away i thought the customer always came first why would they want to risk a customer not coming back i mean i can just go down the road to borics these women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs i won't be back disappointed:(
0,people who work here are very rude i have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person but no it happen every time i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there it is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them the people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation plus it is very dirty perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other i will not go back again
0,coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care if you're a local i get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for i really wanted to like tazza d'oro i've been several times hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences i drink espresso i know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn i have no complaints about paying $300 for an espresso but if it isn't right and i let you know you should probably try again the last time i went in both baristas admitted they hadn't triedpulled the espresso i ordered the gentlemen working there who was very nice pulled my shot i tried it and it was very sour i let the girl standing directly in front of me know that i didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment "ya well we just got it" silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you "just got" to taste goodthis place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future it's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there it's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off
0,i am just the most jaded vegan in town; quiet storm's food menu bores me to tears that which i will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home their coffee isn't all that great either as given the choice local la prima is in my favor tears this is the only vegetarian restaurant on the east side of town and oh so close to me but i cannot stand to go there desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room
0,must be a glutton for punishment because i keep finding myself hungrily returning to the quiet storm the menu has slightly changed and they are no longer cash only this time it was the "8th ward" that inflicted extreme disappointment not sure what 8th ward is supposed to mean but i will forever associate it with a dry boring place and i thought we were getting a party platter this appetizer sampler included the worst hummus evaar; i am near positive that they forgot to add garlic lemon salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as "garlicky" on the menu sooo wrong "the butter" another wtf of a name was also very dry and bland the salsa was good and there were plenty of dipping accessories too many really given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portionsat this point i've tried most of the vegan options qs has to offer and the only luck i've had has been with the byob go figure i wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if i didn't really desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction and it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (i shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of "the best" vegetarian restaurant pittsburgh has to offer
0,i think heidi s pretty much covered all of the bases here the lemon-ginger tea that i ordered was weak perhaps not steeped hot enough the hummus wow definitely the worst; tasted like paste yuck with a capital why i considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant but since i do not plan to return i guess methinks not
0,a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years every time i have ever gone the service is awful it's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you i think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw also the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine the one great thing about this place is their coffee and that's it
0,it is reasonably priced  yes my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10)  however the place did not look clean to me--i won't be back because of that
0,i got a plate with seisage tofu scramble and sundried tomato toast my whole plate was entirely dry chewy and unpalatable i had high hopes for the tofu scramble especially after seeing positive reviews about it but honestly it tasted like nothing i thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu but it was hard dry and chewy hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate but that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy anything will taste better drenched in gravy we think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water on top of all this service wasn't the greatest i had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)i wanted when i ordered the toast option for my meal then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice we had to tell someone else to get it for us also they don't really wash their cups there are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty good idea but poorly executed food i've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens avocados and more for a vegetarian place there was nothing green on our plates this experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price
0,tofu scramble ever days old cold hard inedible  sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish i can't even believe that the server let alone the  "chef" thought it appropriate to serve brought my 2 year old along had to get a high chair i'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one
0,imagine that this is the restaurant that i would make if i were 20 years old and knew nothing about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool  in that it does some things right but none of the important things  it has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright so that's good  they have good music but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place  its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker  i know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well  if only there was a way to solve this problem like just riffing here more speakers at a lower volumethey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to  they include coffeeteajuicewhatever in the price of the brunch because like everyone i hate choices too and i definitely wanted at least one of those  i'm looking at the menu and its a veganveggie place so we're never going to be good friends but i'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful  there are two tex-mex-ranchero breakfast dishes that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but i assure you it was not enough herei go with the egg frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note  it comes with a salad that is not bad but who wants a salad for breakfast  as we're leaving the waiter who's been fine the whole time asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers "dc"  the waiter replies "oh i'm sorry about that"  now neither of us is actually born in the dc area nor do i even particularly like living there  so i'm not personally offended but i'm not sure if someone from or living in pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about washington dc or almost any other large city  its not like property values in pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there whereas in washington dc they arei was not enjoying the restaurant before that but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it  if you're vegan and have literally no other options then i guess you're going here  if both of those conditions aren't true then go anywhere else
0,cheap i'll say that but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working and when they do only respond snarkily there are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from
0,and atmosphere are great but my god the cupcakes are the worst ever  there is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all  i think a fakedisplay cupcake would have been fresher and maybe even taste better  yes it was that bad  mr manager try your stuff before you sell it
0,bought a latteno wait actually i bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on (not all for me i had a friend with me) when i ordered the 2nd latte i sat down and realized i didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me really maybe it sound petty to you but i like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part it's all about customer service and considering i had just spent over $2500 a little foam wasn't much to ask good coffee bad customer service
0,staff  dirty tables i agree with the other reviews here  i think the "manager" only hires other smokers and they spend 90% of their time sitting outside smoking instead of being prepared to serve customers  i go there because sometimes it's convenient bc of the location but last week they left their ac broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather)  no additional fans nothingthen when it was fixed i went in ordered coffee and an order of hummuscarrotcelery (prepackaged)  not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days but the celery was rotting at the ends yes brown and rotting  i showed the kid working there who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette and i asked for another one  without opening it i could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot just like the one i was given  i asked for my money back  you know what was the worst thing though  the kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery rotting celery back in the case to serve to other unsuspecting customers  hello allegheny county health departmentthen the ultimate insult: 2 kids came in selling candy bars  i've seen this there before but this time i said to them: "you know this is a business you shouldn't be here"  well the older of the 2 girls (probably 11-12 at most - where is her mother) put her hands on her hips and said in a smart-ass tone: "we asked da owner we is allowed ta be here"well that coffee i spent $2 on  that is the last money i will spend in that place  disgusting
0,guess is that "ruth k" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner  regent square deserves a better coffee shop run by someone with good business sense  what kind of a "business" only prepares food (chickentuna salad hummus) once a week  does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge  also whenever they lose an employee they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months  they should be open till 10 pm as it is with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood especially in the summer my guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door   otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the placebtw katerbean did go smoke free before the allegheny county ordinance went into effect but the place to this day reeks of stale smokeadded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted  i'll just say i received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it  tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition i asked for a refund and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers that was the last straw  i won't spend another dollar there
0,really want this place to be awesome because yet again i want regent square to be an up and coming area  this place has been here for years and as i sit drinking my bitter bitter coffee and smelling the overwhelming scent of (i believe) dog pee i wonder how it's even possible  the three times i've been here i'm greeted as if i'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent  they always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if i am terrifying to them then duck out of the way  then grudgingly come when i peek around the counter at them  if i didn't i'm convinced that they would just sit there as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place or what the next step should even be  this is what i like to call "the dance of shitty customer service"  today (and i write this longingly looking over at square cafe) i decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded and i figured the quiet would be a good thing  the girl at the counter was on the phone and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until i said 'excuse me'  the charming reply: "yeah" she grudgingly got off the phone and after accomplishing the herculean task of handing me a cup i pumped this swill that i'm currently drinkingshe's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner  i'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day or she's just an asshole butif i had to bet i'm going with assholethis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is and the foodjust don't eat the food  (side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something  she stomps around like she's being sent to her room  then continues muttering)okay so this place is a travesty  bad coffee bad odor bad lighting unbelievably bad grudging service  i would beg the owners to put any effort into this place  as it is now it's cornered the market in regent square and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of braddock avenue
0,katerbean is the abusive boyfriend that i keep coming back to and hate myself for it there is nothing else around and convenience wins today due to the snow and my extreme exhaustion and need for caffienewhy do you ask i just asked the gal behind the counter kindly if i could borrow a pen for a moment i got an annoyed sigh an eye roll  and zero eyecontact really i asked for a pen not a kidney my pleading for a coffee shop intervention from someone anyone is now a red alert help us rs residents please
0,it possible to give zero stars  if so katerbean would rate a zerobad atmosphere unfriendly employees slow and reluctant service pump your own coffee dingy interior dirty tables  if they only had telescreens which couldn't be switched off then this place would be a perfect setting to film orwell's "1984"
0,effin starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks horrible customer service and they always screw up our orders i just don't understand why they're so lazy i understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though but if you hate your job don't take it out on the loyal customers your life sucks we get it but you have one job at starbucks so do it right it's not hard
0,here for a "quick" breakfast on our way from the hotel to fallingwater and regretted the decision immenselyextremely long lines and poorly trained staff as a former employee i know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink this staff was not trained at all and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd it took me 32 minutes for me to receive my order (there were 7 customers in front of me) and my order was incorrect i ordered a small coffee medium latte a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich i know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about 40 seconds in oven so i can't comprehend why it took so long to get my order would never come here again i also received a warm cheese danish instead of my croissant first the warm creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing and second they looked so dejected when i pointed out that i ordered a croissant i almost just leftdo not recommend
0,owner nicholas g nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone maybe too much hp for him if you see an 08 white porsche with fl plate 917 mnc stay clear guy drives like a nut almost ran me off the road in boca raton by 95
0,went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great well i can't write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink i was expecting her to offer to make me a new one since she was the one the dropped it in there but instead all i got a was blank stare the coffee shop down the street had great coffe and they don't drop anything in there as well
0,of 200 reviews i've written only 14 1 star reviews  that's 07%  that means i never really write 1 star reviews  la prima espresso in the strip district gets one  :(they've got a good coffee but i will never be back bc the older woman who is the barista in the morning was unforgivably rude without reasonthe coffee is good i would have liked to become a regular but i dont want to start every morning dealing with her nasty attitude  yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when i asked for lots of room for creami am a former barista  i *know* asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets  if you hate the public you shouldn't work with themthis morning takes the cake and i just won't be back  here's what happened:  i walked in and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular  because she was busy and bc i've barista'd myself i waited patientlyand waited and waited  it was a few minutes but an eternity when you really need coffeeshe never even looked at me  then all of a sudden she goes "okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee"  wtf  i liked her sense of urgency but seriously  rudei asked for a medium coffee in a large cup or if that's not possible a medium coffee with lots of room not hearing me she goes "what was that" and the older gentleman said "she wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup"  and the woman turns to me and snaps "and you couldn't repeat that yourself"even the guy she was talking to her regular was like "whoa"  he tried to make some excuse for her like "she's just fired up today"  then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter  was she having a bad day  am i the doppleganger of someone she hates  i dont know i don't care  i believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now as there are other posts with complaints about her "do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time i was there today and it was 615am and there was no employees at all managed very poorly the older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesn't open on time when she is scheduled please move this lady to a different time 6am is too early for her" i won't ever be back  if that's just her spunky personality well her personality sucks  seriously lady you're not a morning person  you should ask for later shifts
0,used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business  however with the last experience i will have to rethink that my aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday when it was delivered it looked beautiful  however once opened not so much  inside it was filled withdollar general brand goods when i stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect if it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip so moral of the tale if you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the dollar store you know where to go to make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care
0,lindsay's best friend and maid of honor i went with her to jim ludwig's a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers  we sat down and jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed  i very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces  not only do i know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement but i was also at the consultation to witness the discussion  the centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies or dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding  in no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed  i don't understand how there was a "miscommunication" as i saw the paperwork  i just know that i won't be using jim ludwig's for any of my own special occassions
0,security at any venue i have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks $9 for a double fuck that noise security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door i've been through airports with hassle
0,here for a concert and the security instantly assumed that i had been drinking which i had not my friend was also hassled because he purchased his ticket online in advance and they were apparently unable to handle that transaction personally i will not be attending any other performances here
0,wanted a late night snack but also wanted boba so this place had what i wanted it was my first time (in cap locks for the owner to understand) and i was a bit excited as soon as i walked in there was no greeting (customer service is a must for me) so it was a bit awkward i didn't know where exactly to order because the cashier was on the side but the menu was in the middle and i didn't see the cashier until later because a few people were blocking it (it didn't seem like there was a line forming because everyone was just standing around) in the meantime i was pretending to look at the menu but i already knew what i was going to order because i looked into this place before coming anyways i ordered a large taro slush with boba eight pieces of lobster balls and popcorn chickenmy boba was already done and made i thought they were going to call it out or put it out immediately (like all the other boba and coffee places) but no they put it on the side until my whole order was finished i waited a couple minutes more than five minutes actually eventually i asked for it and it already melted i didn't ask for a milk tea i asked for a slush the "company policy" obviously needs changing the boba pearls are just the usual boba pearls and the taro is the usual taro the flavor is there but not enough to be like omg it was okayas for the eight lobster balls and the popcorn chicken it was way to salty for me it would've been great to be informed that you had an option for salt or no salt but then again it was my first time so how would i even know it would be salty for my taste buds but i do admit that the crunch lasted a while i didn't think these snacks will get me full but the large drink filled me up so i couldn't eat the rest of the popcorn chicken and lobster balls it was okayoverall my whole experience it was okay this place is something to check out once i'd probably come back again but after i felt like i've been insulted by the owner and the employees looking miserable no way
0,was on my way home and this was the last chance for milk tea before heading towards mountains edge  i already passed chinatown and was too lazy to turn back  ordered the milk green tea  worst milk green tea i've ever had  no green tea taste what so ever and so so sweet  yuck  it was pre-made and he basically just poured it out of a pitcher saw it for myself i was so pissed at myself for picking this placedon't you hate when you do that  i chucked the drink in the trash when i got home  better off stopping at starbucks for a grande latte for the price i paid for this disgusting milk green teaanywaysthat's what i get for being lazy and not driving back towards chinatown for some real milk green tea  oh welllesson learnedyelp fail
0,kick you out at 9pm sharp when i got here at 8:45pm they said they were out of boba i don't know how a place with "boba" in their name doesn't have their namesake product so i said alright and ordered some popcorn chicken it took them nearly 10 minutes to make it keep in mind i was the only customer and there were two employees working so i start eating and less than 5 minutes later they both tell me that they're closing so i have to leave i ask if i can finish eating (i have about 6 pieces left at this point) and they say no because they have to go out back to throw away trash and they can't leave me alone in the front what the popcorn chicken itself was fine but the service was horrendous
0,service suckscame here with my family on a monday around 8pm there were 2 girls working we ordered a thai tea slush and a strawberry banana smoothie we paid for our drinks tipped the girls and waited while our drinks were being made when one of the girls brought our drinks out we noticed they had made us a regular iced thai tea rather than a thai tea slush we told her that there was a mistake - and she just had this look of pure annoyance she didn't apologize for the mistake or even said anything to us after we told her there was a mistake all she did was go to the register to ring us up the price difference - a whopping 11 cents seriously you're going to make us pay an 11 cent price difference on a mistake you made and after we tipped your rude ass already whatever - we paid the 11 cents and waited for her to remake our drink after she was done making our drink she just put it on the counter without saying anything to us and walked away we grabbed our drinks and got the hell out of there seriously i wouldn't have minded paying the price difference if the girl was nice about it at least apologize for the miscommunication or somethingneedless to say we won't be back
0,this place out for the first time yesterday since the hubby was craving boba and it was the closest one on our way home i got the honey lemon tea while he got the strawberry tea my drink okay not overly sweet and had a hint of a rosy aftertaste probably from the tea his tea however sucked pretty badly first they got his order wrong and gave him a strawberry milk tea it would have been okay had his drink tasted good but it tasted terrible despite him not wanting to i forced him to take it back since it was their mistake anyway they finally gave him his strawberry tea but to his disappointment it tasted like faucet water with an over abundance of sweetener it was so bad that he threw his drink away after only a couple of sips maybe it's just us since we are used to the quality of tea we get at qq boba in henderson but this place really isn't worth coming back to
0,place makes me want to kick someone in the face how can it takes 2 workers 15 minutes to make a passion fruit ice tea with no one in line or  are they really making my ice tea in the back this place is horrible horrible service horrible tea my passion fruit ice tea tastes like water with a drop of passion fruit flavor ugh never again
0,service ever so the boyfriend and i were at town square on a friday afternoon we were really really thirsty i suggested we go to lollicup to get some kind of flavored iced tea there was no one in line as my boyfriend and i were making our way to the order window however another couple got there right before us so we got in line behind them there were 3 girls working so we didn't think it would be that long of a wait with only 2 people before us and no one around waiting for their drinks this was definitely not the case the couple before us apparently knew one of the girls that was working there and proceeded to have a personal conversation for several minutes without even ordering anything we ended up just leaving for the clear disregard the workers had for their customersnever again will i try to order a drink from here i'll just wait until i go to florida to get my lollicup fix
0,yuck and triple yuck this is literally the worse boba place i have ever been to not only the drinks suck they lied too before i ordered i asked the cashier if the avocado smoothie is made from powder or real avocado and she said it's made from real avocado oh boy did she lie i couldn't taste any avocado in the drink at all and it was sooooooo sweet it was just like drinking liquid splenda sugar taro milk tea yuck yuck way way too (artificial sweetener) sweet with absolutely no taro flavor at all we took like 2 sips and had to throw them away because it was basically undrinkable (even though we were thirsty) it's not cheap either
0,boba drink was so disgusting too sweetnever again
0,was already irritated after i paid for my drink because i thought it was extremely overpriced but almost lost my temper completely when i literally waited over twenty minutes for two smoothies  there were several drink orders in front of me but it did not warrant a twenty minute wait  my husband and i ended up missing the movie we planned on watching in the movie theater upstairs  my mango smoothie that cost over five dollars tasted nasty too  it didn't even taste like mango and there was a weird after taste never again
0,was willing to accept the expensive mediocre boba tea i was also willing to accept the 20+ minute wait both times i orderedwhat i'm not willing to accept is that the cashier told me they were out of boba i ordered tea anyway the people who ordered before me got boba which makes sense however the couple that ordered after i did got boba tooso they were only out of boba for my drink
0,went to the window at 8:53 and no one was around a minute later a girl comes up and says they're out of boba and no hot drinks because they're about to close  i said "ok nevermind" since it was such a burden to her   as we were leaving she was actually happier that we weren't getting anything which would've caused her to actually work
0,needs zero stars where is the management for this place the customer service is severely lacking  non existent  and why are we put in a position to have to get attention to take our business pass
0,here is disgusting vegas got nothing compared to california's lollicup or any boba places for that matter vegas needs to step their boba game up
0,to cocomero today after lunch just like i usually would for the past year when school was in session i went up to the counter to order my usual - fruit bingsu with syrup rather than milk because i can't have milk what was different was the "manager" this time refused to make it for me he claimed that it was best with condensed milk and i would just have to deal with it i tried to explain to him nicely that i understand but that's not how i like it also that i've been doing it for the past year and even though the amount of syrup has been hit or miss i still like it that way and i haven't complained about it instead of listening to the customer he insists that he is "the manager of all of this (with hand motions)" and refused to sell me what i requested i ended up giving up and leaving most likely won't be back as long as "the manager of all of that" is still around since he refuses to sell me the one thing i can eat and enjoying having
0,fact that a self serve yogurt bar doesn't allow you to sample any of the 16 flavors they have blows my mind being from out of town and having plenty of similar establishments near my home that are same concept and allow samples i was confused when i asked the counter "you would rather have me not buy anything than sample 2 flavors"  responseyes unreal plenty of places are successful and lucrative with allowing a taste test my only thought is the ownermanager must be cheaper than subsidized corn  fellow friends said their yogurt was bland probably why they stopped allowing samples
0,do i start yelpers beware the high reviews offered to this place are deceitful this place is terriblefood: this is only reviews off the bubble tea because of previous reviews claiming it was great far from great it was this watered down tasteless and sorry excuse for bubble tea puts all other bubble teas on top worst of all the bubbles tasted old and as if they were stored away all winter not fresh in fact our bubbles were more like giant balls stuck together the tea was watery and lacked true flavor of mango or macha what a dissappointment however the people of the burgh wouldn't notice the difference so fortunately for you this is a good thing service: meh slow and it seemed that they had no order in serving peopleinterior: it's outside which was nice 1 star given disclaimer: i drink lots of bubble tea if you want a true experience go to philly or miami they make a thicker juice with fresher bubbles
0,had to visit yelp to see if i could have been forewarned how the bubble tea is not good granted it was my first time here and i only ordered one thingtotally ruined the mood for laying out in the sun sipping on a cold bubble tea while reading a book i ordered the pink rose tea - if ur a bubble tea fanatic (i'm from la) definitely not what i was expecting i can't really put into words what is this hot pink neon drink with only eight tapioca balls in it :( i'm too disappointed with this one to see if the green tea or taro tea would be any better
0,am not happy with asia tea houseit was a hot day and i was feeling optimistic so i decided to order a bubble tea i went with the mango fresh fruit then the wait began  fifteen minutes later the guy hands me my smoothie i took a sip this was followed by a frown another sip was necessary to make sure i was not just imagining things yep this was the worst smoothie i had ever tasted and i have had a lot of bubble teas in my day forget the fresh fruit it was too watered down to be identified as a mango smoothie and the tapioca balls were tough and bland i had just paid $4 for water and crappy tapioca ballsthe search for good boba tea in pittsburgh continues
0,my boyfriend and i found this place as one of the few (if not only) donut spots in phoenix that's open 247 after he had a craving for donuts at 1am it had good reviews and i saw on yelp that they served boba there we decided to give it a go when we got there he first ordered a boba for me and began his dozen donuts order the donuts he wanted (namely chocolate simple to make you would think) was not available at 1am he then asked for another type of donut (boston cream) not available only ones they said they had at that time of night was glazed raspberry filled and lemon filled he declined the donuts altogether because he was frustreated with continually getting "sorry we don't have that"i gave this place a one star on his behalf and because i had my boba drink and it was descent however nowhere near the best i've tasted i like my boba squishy and not too rough to chew i tried boba at this one viet restaraunt that was better but that's another yelp review in the makingoverall case and point: we may have been better off going there earlier in the day and their selection seems to be extremely limited after typical business hours if your business is said to be open 24 hours and you're one of the only open available donut shops in the area that never close please have a majority of your donut selection available around the clock thank you for reading this rant
0,love bosa donuts i have been to several locations and this is by far the worst the lady that works there with the funky colored eyeshadow has been rude to me on 2 different occasions i have never been greeted by her she tossed my card to me at the register when she was done swiping it little things like that just really piss me off especially when i am a repeat customer i suggest going to the bosa donuts in mesa by bookmans the people there are nice and the facility is very clean go where u are appreciated
0,place really sucks1 doughnuts are crazy greasy and heavy2 service is exceptionally rude snatching money and my card from my hand on two different occasions3 pressuring the up-sell to a dozen i had to ask last time while ordering a half dozen inside; if she were going to join my wife and i in controlling 4 kids hopped up on doughnuts and begging for more so stop up-selling 4-6 to a dozen4 rarely will your order be right in the drive thru open the box before pulling away5 they talk over you in the drive thru and inside while you're ordering actually had to  tell her "if you would please stop talking you'd hear my order"to other posterreviewers that say this is perfectioni question your palettebetter off going to safeway and getting them there bosa is aweful
0,donuts but the worst service ever every time i go there which is a lot since i live down the street they always mess up my order either i was missing an item (and still payed for it) or they make me pay more money then i should last time my girlfriend and i went there to eat they charged us $24 for 2 breakfast sandwiches that cost maybe $4 each i had to literally scream at the manager to get a refund (paid with card) and it wasn't even in full they only gave me $8 cash and free food then had the nerve to say never come back again i will never give my money or support to this establishment again
0,bewarei am a very big fan of bosa and their menu items delicious coffee delicious doughnuts delicious breakfast sandwiches and delicious boba tea however someone there is engaged in credit card fraud and identity theft my information was ripped off and sold to a third party harvester that tried to drain all the funds in my account all within the time it took to drive thru and order breakfast but fortunately for me i check my activity daily i can't say i won't ever go back again because these are the acts of an individual one would assume but i would highly advise anyone who goes there to be a cash paying customer from now on i know i will be
0,not so good lately  one really nice girl there  but the rest are pretty unkind   they mess up on orders a lot too  i ordered a tuna croissant and got home and it was a turkey yucky sandwich of which i threw away  i called back to tell them and the girl was rude  and i got no apology  terrible customer service that is
0,i first found out about this place i was very interested within the first week i went at least 8 times bringing friends with me to show them how awesome this place is but recently the staff here is disappointing yesterday i took my friend there for a  fun drink to have when we entered we were the only customers in the place and were not greeted he ordered a drink and i ordered something new we were shouted at when our drinks were ready we sat down and my drink wasn't the tastiest i have had having only one sip i returned to the register and explained that this wasn't agreeing with me and if i could switch it out with three people standing behind the counter not one could speak up or look me in the eye one mumbled that they couldn't do anything because their manager wasn't there i asked what could be done and he said "well you can buy another drink" seriously what happend to making the customer happy i was very dissappointed and it will be awhile before i come back what a pity
0,has to be the worst ice cream shop that i have been to i walked in expecting a varied of ice creams and come to see that they do not have much to choose from i ask for the basic flavor strawberry and they did not carry it the person over the counter seemed confused and did not know what he was doing i did not even bother to order a smoothie seeing how bad the place looked
0,been reading yelp for two years now and it's been our guide on picking restaurants and what have you i trusted the review 90% of the time wc is pretty good my personal experience with this establishment yesterday was unpleasant walked in yesterday late afternoon to try this place and there's a family on one table enjoying their ice cream and two chinese female in their early twenties who wear a hoochie mama type of clothing ahead of me ordering  the chinese dude in his 50's taking orders is somewhat extra nice to these 2 which is fine suggesting to sample all the diff type of ice cream when female one ordered he asked female 2 about what she wants and she said she didn't want any the chinese counter guy said " oh u should've tasted more free samples while u were waiting" my point is when it was our turn my daughter tried one flavor of ice cream and when she wants to try another flavor the guy had this annoyed look and said " i can let her try another flavor but i need to scoop the ice cream & drop it to to her "used plastic spoon" what a rude ass  he said its a waste to give my daughter a new spoon that's the 1st reasons why they scored one2nd - while he's about to do my boba the family who's about to leave decided to order some soda the bastard stop and took their freaking order not sure if i have the look of a push over but i know my face doesn't look friendly anymorelast the register broke the dude was now clueless on what to do so the family who were paying for the soda helped him to figure out what they oweafter 20 minutes of hell and mistreatment he can probably tell i'm about to explode and let him have it he gave me a scoop of ice cream to top my boba for the inconvenience and i can tell from his face he don't really wants to do thisto be honest the wait doesn't bother me but the fact that this perv was all nice and giddy to these young hoochie female and he wants us to re use our freaking plastic spoon the it's reason of the 1 star their boba by the way is just 2 stars i'd rather go to cefiore down the road or better yet fresh cup in chinatown btw the red bean boba is so badwe drove straight to human bean and got snowy mocha instead i know it's not boba but were almost home so i got coffee instead
0,this place is 4 star i think there's a secret in making boba definitely this is not the place how can anybody mess up a watermelon slush  yikes donot come here for boba please
0,is only for bobamy friend told me this place has really good ice cream but i was craving for boba tea so i bought taro tea with boba when i first took a sip the taro flavor was vague and didnt have enough taro flavor in a taro tea and the bobas were very hard and not fresh like come on i wanted taro not like a watery purple drink  i took few sips and threw it away because it was disgusting they seriously need improvement on their flavor or the powder they use if you are going here for taro try somewhere else if you are going here for boba don't waste your money
0,absolutely hate to do this because i would totally give this place a five star rateing however today was possibly one of the worst experiences everusually love this place the owner is always nice and we like coming here to visit this one worker cuz she's always nice but today we were helped by two girls who have pretty cruddy customer service my boyfriend got a vegan brownie sundae and asked for no fudge the girl still put fudge on it which was whatever then we asked to have the brownie warmed up since she failed to ask if we wanted it warmed up before hand they took the ice cream off and just handed it to us in a cup (i honestly would have replaced every thing) they proceeded to warm the brownie and burnt it then 10 minutes later still no warm brownie she said the brownie was soft but still chilly and asked if it was okayi mean i guess we've been waiting a while so nevermind alreadythe icecream was half melted any way so in result no warm brownie and melted icecream they were sorry but didn't do much to fix the problem
0,tummy ache i should've stayed away after reading the reviews but it was close and it was late at night so i gave in in short one freezer wasn't working so all tubs were stacked on top of each other in working freezer took too long to sample flavors because she had to move tubs around husband was not impressed so just told me to chose what i wanted n get out of there i chose on a sunday pictured with chocolate syrup walnuts banana and two scoops of ice cream advertised at $550 chose green tea and taroask for no chocolate syrup came to check out and she charged me a $025 fee when i asked her what that was for she said for the banana after pointing out the price and picture her answer was "that's from a long time ago"   i told her my piece of mind mentioned i was a yelp de-customer and went outside to eat halfway through my sunday my stomach is turning we're pulling into our driveway now and i am running straight to the toilet avoid this place as a fellow business owner know that i've discounted many clients because they had seen other pricing (be it old) it's all about customer retention fail
0,in to the sound of a blender in the back kitchen with no greeting 6 minutes later a girl comes out with two drinks for the people waiting before us i finally get to order a honeydew slush she disappears to the back to make it which is strange because there's a full blender set up in the front after hearing the blender go off about 6 different times and another 5-6 minutes she reappears with my drink mind you she's only making one drink so i don't know why the blender went off so many times it's super icy very light on the honeydew flavor and the liquid is separating from the ice mush definitely not coming back what a waste of 450 go to tea planet or volcano tea on spring mountain their boba is delicious flavorful smooth and quick
0,get the single star not for the doughnuts but because it was 112 degrees outside and they had no ac going in the restaurant it may have been hotter in the restaurant than outside it it was hard to order since i couldn't concentrate on anything but the heat i bought three doughnuts but couldn't ditsy to enjoy them because of the warmth i bought the chocolate bismarck a raspberry jelly and some sort of crunch doughnut they were all good too bad i had to enjoy them in the car of the starbucks parking lot i will try them again hopefully in january when i won't care if it's so hit inside the restaurant
0,taste left in my mouth after my 6 yr old daughter drank expired milk that they had out for sale she didn't check the date but that shouldn't be her responsibility i'm strongly upset after this experience so be wary if you decide to go and remember to check the dates
0,will never go here again every time we take our daughter here the next day she is sick the last two times she has gotten viral infections and we have to go to the er as she got a temp of 105 obviously this place is not cleaning their facility properly
0,time here and we received terrible customer service  i usually don't write many reviews but as a marketing major i was in shock  we stood at the counter for several minutes waiting to see about getting a bowling lane and then were cut in front of by a group a people who were eagerly greeted the guy announcing orders over the intercom sounded absolutely irritated and like he hated life and then when we were finally helped at the counter we were told we could bowl if we could get done in 50 minutes or less  the whole experience was extremely unpleasant and we will never return and i will never recommend
0,to parents:  the wave pool is not safe for children under the age of eight my five year old is a strong swimmer (gold medal swim school in chandler for 3 years) and almost drowned due to a current created by the waves the lifeguard posted right above her made no move to rescue her until i told him she was drowning she was crying for help but he didn't hear her   i thought this would be a gentle pool as it was for a child's birthday party  if i would have known the strength of the waves i would had my swimsuit on and my daughter in a life vest i hope the lifeguard finds a different summer job- he almost lost a little girl literally under his nose
0,disappointed weve loved this clubhouseuntil today beautiful saturday morning and we decided to take our 3 kids to play basketball we show up just to find the court and the kids playground gates padlocked not sure what my dues are paying for if we cant use the facilities with our kids at 10 am on a saturday
0,went for the indoor pool since heritage complex is a bit too far the front dest was rude the girl who checked us in at the pool was not friendly and the pool area was pretty dark and it was small we will not be going there again
0,wouldn't know how this place is the direcrions for the address listed ended me up at "the district" shopping center on green valley parkway
0,away from this place they have nurses on drugs walking around in a zombi like state nurses that have been in drug rehab several times an handing out patient meds this place is run bad
0,unprofessional  from the moment you walk in at least one of the receptionists is pleasant another is a complete loud mouth and the things that come out of her mouth are absolutely rude and ridiculousthanks to "loud mouth" i've learned (in detail) that the director of nursing at this facility is having an affair with one of the male staff members  can you imagine waiting to greet your loved one and learning about such shenanigans  all from your seat in receptionthis combined with very poor bed-side mannerisms and the fact that i've met this don (and she is horribly unfriendly) told me that the facility is not fit to care for my mother and we pulled her out after just a few monthsplease do your loved ones a favor do not send them to this sham
0,father was a resident in this nursing home for almost two years  the care he received was inconsistent and disappointing to say the least  i found that some staff members were professional and caring but the majority of the cnas who interact with the patients on a daily basis were unprofessional and severely lacking in bedside manners i strongly recommend exploring other facilities if you are in need of care for yourself or a loved one  there are places out there with caring competent staff members that far exceed tlc in quality  this place has so-so reviews on medicaregov  they may be able to check basic boxes but when it comes to personalized attention and compassion they have a long way to go
0,unprofessional and sketchy staff - all the other yelp reviews will confirm thisyou know a nursing home is bad when you call to get information on your family member who is receiving care and the rudeilliterate nurse you get a hold of refuses to identify themselves - won't even give you their first name  what kind of nursing home hires people like thatlater we found out my family member ended up hospitalized due to dehydration  they refused to assist my family get information about his care after he was "discharged" - that was the word they kept throwing around even to my family member while he was still there waiting for an ambulanceif you are considering placing a family member in this facility read these reviews and also this news story: http:www8newsnowcomstory23140454nursing
0,know wherehow to start this review - i will start with if you can find any other place to send your family members for care it would be in your best interest to do so  my moms insurance company gave her no choice to go here  repeatedly i arrive to visit her and she is in a wet diaper and has been for a very long time due to the smell i lost my cool and a nice person (wish i could remember her name great smile not a nurse someone with authority) told me should would find someone to help  she stopped a man in the hall and he gave her instructions to find a nurse  later i found out this man was the administrator and he passed my need for help onto someone else  in a nutshell don't bother making a complaint the director of nursing will not return phone calls her name is donna and the nurse who told me her name told me not to tell anyone that she told me her name as she would be fired i could go on but it makes me more angry to think about it positves clean facility allows healthy pets to visit decent food cons unhappy nurses poor care no one who can help will listen at the management level
0,am giving this place zero stars  my grandmother was sent to this hell hole to build and regain strength after being at tlc for almost 10 days  my grandma had been vomiting large amount of green vomit for days her blood pressure was finally checked and it was so low they rushed her to er my grandma is now laying in icu with the worst pneumonia one can have all of this is caused by lack of staff members doing what they are paid to do ( care for the patients) when my grandma arrived at the er photos were taken of her bed sores and amounts of green vomit my grandma was severely dehydrated mal nourished  and know where near where  the recovery she should have beenaccording to several staff members at the hospital my grandma is currently at say that tlc is well known for all of their neglect i will go to my grave fighting to have tlc's doors closed and pray that all staff members get what they deserve when they need care somedayi am aware that when we get older we will pass there is no reason to take years away from anyone due to laziness this place has messed with the wrong family this time
0,being admitted to this facility my elderly friend received a few days treatment and then was constantly badgered to sign into a hospice facility called solari she was told by tlc that she could stay there up to 100 days then suddenly after less than 2 weeks she was told she had to leaveperiod no notice once again the solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in solari moved her the following day tlc on site social worker was usually no where to be found and never returned her calls or the many pages the receptionist made for her stating "i know she's here i don't know why she's not responding"avoid this place at any costs
0,place has unmotivated staff whom are mostly not happy or caring to the residents their standards are poor and utterly sad for any human being do not waste your breath here
0,i could give this place zero stars i would  they hire personnel with no health care experience to run the expressions (memory care) unit  my mother was a resident there (she had alzheimersdementia) until she passed away  i didn't write a review prior as i feared that the care she received would be even worse  imagine visiting your mother and finding her with fooddirt caked on her hands so thick that you had to scrub her hands before you could hold her hand to help her stand up  or how about taking her to get her hair done and her scalp had the worse case of "cradle cap" that the stylist had ever seen  her dr even advised the personnel at prestige that they needed to do a better job washing her hair use special shampoo and watch her while showering to make sure she washed the shampoo out if her hair  the worst experience was when my mother fell and they sent her in an ambulance to the hospital with no paperwork or personnel fromprestige with her  she didn't even know who she was at this point  by the time i got to the hospital the people there are trying to ask her questions and don't know why she can't answer them  to cap off this awful experience when my mother's death was imminent i sent an email with explicit instructions as to what they were to do when she passed  i was assured "your directives will be followed"   needless to say they were not  i called to check on my mother at 8:30 in the morning to see how she was doing that day and was told what they did for her the night prior  when i questioned them again i was told "oh she died at 3:00 this morning didn't anyone call you"  when i got ahold of the facility director all i got from her was"i guess we messed up"  real compassion there  maybe they spend all there time making the place look nice and playing games but they sure missed the boat when it came to taking care of my mother  if you are going to have to put a loved one here you might want to think again  for $4500 per month you think you would be able to get better care  if we could have taken care of my mother in our own home i would have  if we had unlimited resources i would have moved her to another place
0,mother recently received rehabilitation services from freedom plaza the people that work at freedom plaza are very friendly beyond that there is very little positive i can say about her experience there in the 2 weeks of her supposed rehabilitation she never walked more than 150 feet she had been labeled a liability this is interesting considering the entire reason she was sent there was to walk and rehabilitate after open heart surgery she walked more in the hospital icu than she did at freedom plaza  during her two weeks there she was not showered or bathed one time  she was continually pulled up out of her recliner by her arms which is contraindicated after open heart surgery we met with case management to address our concerns but none of them were addressed case management rarely returned phone calls i would not send my mom back to freedom plaza given the choice i would not recommend that anyone send their loved one there for rehabilitation they may do a good job at long term care but they do not do a good job at rehabilitation
0,so muchwhile the building level of service and rooms were in line with a typical holiday inn the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and priority club customerbrief summary of my horror story - we check in we get the wrong room  they move us give us keys to a filthy room  we bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean itwe get back to the room and i check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329  after spending about an hour on the phone with my bank we trace the charges to the holiday inn i am staying at via the card that i have left for incidentalsdespite prepaying for the room we've now given the holiday inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110  night roomfurthermore the banks had closed so i couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend  it wasn't that i didn't have access to cash but i had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guyswhen i bring it up at the front desk i am immediately given run around  they pull up my info on their computer and gasp as they see their error  the staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake they simply blamed a computer error  i finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue and i don't receive any further communication as i'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekendthe next day of my stay i call the front desk again and demand answers  this manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue  she spent time on the phone with my bank and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome holiday inn's costly errorafter dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend  i demand to only pay half of my hotel bill which is immediately granted  by then i was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensationultimately don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account which could cash screw you for the weekend  also don't stay at holiday inns because the staff and management is comprised of lazy lying and incompetent thievesthat is all
0,is the second time that my husband and i have stayed at this hotel  both experiences have been terrible  the staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile  the decor is bright and nice but it is not maintained very well  the lobby could use a good cleaning  also there is a $15day charge for parking at this hotel  the location is great you can walk to pretty much anywhere but it is very noisy even on higher floors  we were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room jj told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had  we felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online  then when we got to the room the faucet was so loose it fell over  it was fixed promptly but made a bad first impression  neither time my husband and i have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience  i would strongly recommend staying at one of charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience
0,possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life noisy dirty poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man the way i was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place doesn't even deserve one star in my book avoid at all costs
0,i booked a hotel room here for new years eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before i was staying there my credit card was charged for the room  i was treated like an idiot by carmen who answered the phone  she kept saying that i should have known but i would not have been so upset if i had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted  make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room  would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way i have been treated
0,had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived all the way through to the time we left  it's actually quite sad because i'd like to share the information but i'd rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place  it's awful and we won't be going back  the worst of our experience  let's just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room while we were in it with the privacy sign on pretty much sealed the deal here  if anyone's had theft problems this may be why  hotel staff was quick to throw out "sorry" for each thing that went wrong but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said (i didn't want to give this place any stars but one star is needed to submit this review)
0,clear of this hotel  mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses bar is way overpriced  there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one
0,recently went to a wedding reception here i felt sorry for the bride and groom the place was not clean for starters the food was the worst part the salad was soggy from the dressing sitting on it for far too long and then they put on top a hot fresh baked bread stick that came from the freezer which in turn made the salad hot i had the sirloin it was cold chewy and bland my date had the vegetarian pasta it was over done spinach pasta with some sort of flavorless cream sauce and veggies mix in overpriced drinks and you have one of the worst wedding reception venues ever stay away
0,husband a friend and myself went there for fish on black friday we were surprised that it was not very busy so we thought we would get service pretty quickly we sat at a table near the salad bar and waitedand waited and waited we saw one server and also saw another table waiting for service as well the waitress never once acknowledged that we were sitting there and she had to pass our table to to wait on another table all the waitress had to do was say she would be right with usor something after waiting a half hour with no word from the waitress we got up and left murphy's bar was way more accommodating
0,boyfriend and i came tonight 1219 for fish fry it was our first time the service we got was the worst we both have ever experienced it took us 30 mins to even get a menu or drink we finally got a menu and ordered water 5 min later a different waiter brought us water and took our order i got salad from the salad bar it was fine but my boyfriend got the soup which we were guessing it was clamchowder after 15-20 min our fish arrived it took us probably 5-10 min to eat the fish we were given we ordered all you can eat 15 min after we finished our food a different waitress came with our bill we were never asked if we wanted more we told them we were not going to pay for all you can eat when we got the same amount as a regular order after the whole experience taking over an hour and a half my boyfriend is now sick from the food i don't think we will ever be coming back for food here again which is unfortunate because the fish was actually decent
0,the star says don't come herei'm in the culinary program and the only reason i'm in it is to get my gpa up to go to jwu down the road i'm giving these people 30000 for a certificate degree not even an associates degree and i have no idea where my money is goingwhy because every day i come to class we run out of some type of food or necessary supplies and they are usually out of stock on all their suppliesthe apartments they stick us in arent even close to what they advertise and they stick us in a fairly bad part of town thats actually 20 minutes away from the campusand dont get me started on the students here if you like the fact that they accept just about anybody and yes that includes people with under a 20 gpa and people who've been out of school for 20 years then youll do fine here if you're like me and you dont like how the school accepts everyone just so they can pocket the cash then dont go herei really regret giving these people my money but its the quickest way to get into jwu and get a little experience while i'm at it save your money and go to jwu much better investment
0,school has put me deep in financial debt the amount i owe them for sub par education should give me a masters :( this school is terrible and predatory it is a scam and you should refrain from attending save yourself
0,am dealing with crippling debt from going to school here & do notrecommend that anyone go here i'm living a nightmare with student loanpayments around $850 a month i have a good job & still struggle everymonth at this rate i will never own a house and probably never getmarried or have kids attending the art institute was the worst decision ihave made in my life i don't see how anyone working there can sleep atnight i don't think an art degree should cost over 100k that's just crazy i used to go here to mentor students after graduation but will no longer help a school that has hurt me so much i had decent teachers for the most part & i do have a job in my field but i will be paying almost $1000 a month for the next 20 years unless i win the lottery i was young & stupid (20 years old) when i enrolled here i had no idea what i was getting into i was trying to do something to better my life but it is now ruining my lifethey will accept anyone just to get their money i know people who graduated from here with an associate degree & owe $100k if you're thinking about going here run
0,girlfriend and i where totally lied to by everyone we talked to finally someone from finacial aid pulled me into a side office away from the enrollment counselors and pointed out bachelor's degree would cost a minimum of 90k i recieve the maxium amount of grants and loans i still would have have to pay over $1000 out of pocket every month to cover tuition throughout the course of the meeting i consistantly asked why my finacial wouldn't cover the total cost of tuition when at other schools (that cost the same per credit hour) i would be getting a refund to help cover the cost of housing everytime i asked it no one would answer me they just tried to push me to the point of signing papers and paying the application fee i went home got online and did my own research the reason their tuition ends up being more per degree is because they make you take 60 more credit hours for the same degree if i was going to 90k for an undergraduate degree i would attend an ivy league school f$%^ that school the best part is when the enrollment counselor could see that i wasn't going to sign or pay anything until i did my own research she started getting super aggressive to the point if she wasn't a girl the meeting probably would have ended voilently how can she even get mad at me if they wouldn't have lied to me in the beginning i wouldn't have been there the situation felt like i was being screwed by a used car salesman
0,go here please save yourself the $$$$$$ i got my degree here in fashion marketing this school is a joke its all sales they dont care about u they just want ur money my best friend also went here and is now working for ai she told me about all the shady stuff they do to get ur money she said since she works for them and knows the bs they pull she would have never went here all my close friends i went to school with cant even find a job to even pay for there loans the jobs they send us are for retailhow lame you dont need a college degree to work retail two of my friends pay 500 a month for loans my other pays 1200 i only pay interest because my loans are deferred i'm going to a reputable community college and getting a reputable degree oh ya fyi this school looks bad on your resume i went on a job interview and the lady told me she felt really bad for me that i went there because she used to work there and they are a scam
0,go to this crappy school  it is not worth the money  i transferred from another art institute because they misled me seemed to care only about getting your money  the phoenix location makes me feel like going back to portland for that type of abuse  phoenix is much worse  the teachers don't give your grades promptly nor do they explain what they are expecting to see from you to determine the difference between a 79 85 and 93 on a project for example  they are supposed to submit these grades so you can check them online  i have yet to have a teacher who actually does  when you finally corner your teachers to get your grade they just tell you that you are doing fine  i was a straight a student with a previous bs degree  i attend all my classes and turn in every assignment on time  i am an actor pursuing a film and video degree i have never considered myself an artist (drawer painter sculptor)  i do not mind having to take these classes for my degree but i just wanted to keep my gpa high  i have never had so many b+'s in my life  some folks would be ok with those grades however i am a serious student and pride myself on my gpa  the teachers at this school don't seem to care about truly helping students  it definitely seems like they just hand out grades arbitrarily and don't place much emphasis on returning your tests and assignments promptly  even some of my a's were just given to me because of how the teachers may have felt about meif you are not in the culinary program then you are definitely the redheaded step-child at this schoolif you are not a video game nerd an artsy gay looking femme or a hot fashion design chick then you may feel like an outcast at this schooli am a non-traditional student and a transfer student their bullshit sales tactics and focus in not designed to reach these demographicsi am clean-cut in my 30's prior military veteran former college football player and have already worked in the profession i am pursuing a degree in   i have yet to feel welcomed by any staff member or fellow student at this school accept for security when they ask to see my idyou are not allowed to pick your own classes or schedules at this school  they "somehow" register your classes for you then you have to go through much hassle to change it to a more convienient planif you are a transfer student (even from another ai in the same degree program)  prepare to be screwed in you degree auditit is very difficult to find personal tutoring on a project or software program  even though they advertise differentlythe only decent thing about this school is that they do have decent gear and equipment and the people who work in the rental cage are very helpful  however you have to have permission to check out gear overnight or over the weekend  this just seems like an extra hustle and other schools don't have this policy  all in all this school really sucks  if you are disciplined and focused you can get what you need out of this school but you will regret the price and experience later  if you are a virgin nerd or loser looking to meet and mingle with your peers and figure out what you want out of life then this is the school and experience that you need to have  otherwise if you are young and seeking the traditional college experience or older and already have a job and other obligations then i suggest you go to a "real" college or university  asu or u of a are some good ones  they don't need to hire and train people to be sleazy salesmen in order to pressure you to come to their schools they actually have prestige and they don't need to advertise solely to losers at home sitting on the couch watching daytime network tv dreaming about a career inlike the art institutes have to
0,of very high tuition costs with very little results not worth the money
0,missed a total of 2 days didn't actually miss them just showed up late because of morning traffic and that's only for one of my classes my grades are pretty low now and it's finals week there saying i haven't turned in most of my work when i actually have they still haven't even put in my grades plus it's now been 3 weeks since they've last been updated i soon found out that i actually wasn't the one who was slacking but the teachers them-selfs were especially when it comes down to grading
0,place is good for about an hour of entertainment on a good day  the hi light was paper airplane making something we can easily do at home  my suggestion spend the $4 more and head to the children's museum downtown  it is better by leaps and bounds
0,you would  like for someone be disrespectful to you especially when give helpful advice or please attend class here the staff feels they own this non profit and disrespect you with little apologies or consideration they do not even return emails in a dispute they respect depth of your pocket book giving little in return the charges high premium for class so you can learn with famous artist from another state however complain they have no money up date an obsolete system but flying artist from ny chicago and elect is ok  you don't receive much knowledge or support except you painted with this well know artist does that not sound like it helping local artist or non profit my favorite part is hiring an education director 2013 without a college education or little knowledge of the arts for as many art education majors out there it is miss directed use of funds not supportive to arts in any way  this school has no courtesy or  loyalty to students  educator been there for years you would expect that for price they ask as a connoisseur of 5 star establishment gallery's  and assisting in many non-profits the school fails on all accord but you got to paint with so in so that all you can say

0,food was absolutely gross i ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado bacon and turkey breast what i got was totally different from the picture first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame) there was no avocado 1 slice of bacon no lettuce and to top it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking lunch meat lol no not the kind that you get from the deli the other sweaty nasty looking stuff gross our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so i would have a bit of an attitude if i had to wait 10 tables without assistance too   the manager was really nice of course that disgusting sandwich that i didn't eat was free
0,service cold food our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted bland food crazy overpriced long waits in the arcade 1 beer per hour maximum  avoid at all costs fair manager
0,place just plain sucksbad management lost them bizdumb arcade drama** they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old
0,the dave and busters in homestead pa last night waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs charged them already too - both incorrectly my brother had to walk around and find out who it was waitress never apologized gm was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out did nothing to remedy the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill after spending over $300 plus games we will never go back whatever happened to the customer is always right horrible service
0,of the games were out of order and i had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits  apathetic service staff all around the peanut and i were really disappointed  won't be back
0,keep it short and sweet: save yourself $100 buy a good board game your alcohol of choice order a pizza and invite your friends over what an incredible disappointment after seeing the enticing commercials so many times we decided to give this place a try on a double date i understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however the food was incredibly over-priced came out cold (as in sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and i literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink it was pure juice $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them (not to mention my glass was dirty and i saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop i know the food and beverage commission would be as disappointed as i was) the service was terrible don't ask for anything from your waiter as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade yes if you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games i suppose i would advise you give it a shot i would never recommend their food customer service or drinks save yourself the money and stay home or go for a traditional bowling figure skating roller-blading rock climbing basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead
0,was here on 103 and i have to say this was a horrible experience  me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards  it took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again  we ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table)  no refill on my beverage no how is your food no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered  lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people  i will not be back again to eat
0,beer horrible service horrible menu
0,friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else after we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and i had ordered meal that came with a desert really dissapointing all around
0,a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to germany not worth $595 unfortunately the sausage platter was $1595
0,with my bf we started with the crab artichoke dip it was very greasy and had virtually no crab the wedge salad was good and crisp i had the hazelnut crusted chicken this has to be one of the worst dishes i've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken to finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing
0,service and food i waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence they finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay so i had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay yes i had to try and give them moneyon to the important part food was terrible i had a burger and it was pathetic
0,careful the servers can't pay attention to save their lives and the management cares even less i want to make sure people know how careless the management is particularly mark who seems to let his staff run around
0, what happened to this location  it used to be happy and fun  it just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by  so sad
0,everything from the bad service to the diluted soup to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad to the pre-fabricated pizza avoid this place
0,it started well food was okay deep dish pizza was good but the salad we had - too tiny portionwe were greeted and seated well but later the service was not all good bad bad service first of all we had to ask for everything we wanted the server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts she just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more)later when we talked about this in the front the girl there also just listened and said "okay" not even a sorry oncei would not like to go there again :(

0,you are looking for an "after-school" program for your kids where they jump around for 45 minutes but learn nothing related to "real" korean taekwondo or for that matter martial arts then this is the place to be the fact that the word karate is over the door of a taekwondo facility is due to the fact that they are not sanctioned by the  koreantaekwondo association as their forms techniques and testing are not approved nor recognized students are passed from one belt to the next regardless of how they perform during testing simple logic is pass the kids make them happy so they keep coming in and paying the monthly fee the basic phylisophy of martial arts is nothing more then a pledge they say at the start of each class but zero is done to ensure these words are understood or followed most of the kids are out of control and disrespectful to the instructors and other students any attempt to voice the slightest bit of constructive critism is met with anger followed by bullying emails if you want real martial arts go somewhere else this place is a joke
0,research on karate and compare schools this school puts emphasis on katas and teaches very little sparring ranks are questionable at best if you want to do nice katas and you do not care about learning real karate or practical self defense this school may work for you this school is also not at many locals tournaments red flag took my child out and put them in another school he's now having to relearn everything and realizing they could have gotten really hurt becouse they thought they were learning self defense it's dangerous but if you want to exercise and learn kata dancing and point sparring this could be a good fit otherwise please do your homeworkteenagers are doing most the teaching or adults with new black belts
0,wished i could give them zero stars my daughter attended coach ed's the high rollers class and was harassed and treated awful this coach has a demeaning attitude and makes excuses for everything  i noticed from the first class that the coach didn't have patience with the kids and would get frustrated if they didn't do the moves correctly even on the first try during the second class my daughter had a blister and asked the coach if she could go to the bathroom to wash off the chalk i could see from the viewing window that he grabbed her hand and could also see my daughter's face in pain my daughter came running to me and he had squeezed her hand so tight that he burst her blister my daughter is not sensitive at all and has taking gymnastics at other gyms and i know that this is not the way to threat kids after the class i talked to the coach and all got from him was complaints about how the other coaches in the gym don't see eye to eye with him and he deviated the conversation to other stuff i also talked to my daughter's previous coach to explain my concerns i was told that since he only had two-three fingers in one hand he might have burst her blister by mistake but said that his demeanor was different from all the other coaches during her last class she was told by the coach ed if she was deaf multiple times and was told to go away during my whole time dealing with this coach was pure torture for me and my daughter he does not give kids a chance to learn the moves nor he showed that he cared about the kids or had regard for parents after that incident my daughter walked out of the class and told me everything i immediately talked to the front desk and she informed me that the gym knew of coach ed and that they he has had previous problems with other parentskids i spoke with the owner but i got the feeling that i was ignored i got part of my money back but not all because she said that i only had a problem with one coach to me it shows that she does not take responsibility for her employees and did not really showed much concern yes it was only one coach but it only takes one person to do damage my only regret is taking my daughter here and i will not referred anyone to this hell place their website contradicts to what actually happens herebeware it is not a safe learning environment
0,review is based on observing my daughter's class in the 'firecrackers' groupi do not recommend this company for 'first timers' or inexperienced toddlers how class goes; there are two instructors per class one instructor gives a quick demonstration giving them instructions what to do on the equipment at each station the kids chose which station they want to start at and then they rotate from station to station what i've been seeing; all the kids are at different skill levels different heights different ages and some are better at following directions than others while some of the children are able and capable of maneuvering around the equipment themselves other children who are too little or inexperienced end up waiting around until either a the instructors finally make their way to helping a different station b a kid gets impatient and has to ask the instructor for help or c the child gets bored and starts wandering around and doing whatever they please getting in the way of the other kids let me be honest and say my daughter was definitely 'c' she is too short to reach most of the equipment on her own she is also inexperienced in gymnastics and she has a high energy level with very little attention span throughout most of class she was waiting around for help get bored and do her own thing ultimately getting in the way of everyone else several times neither of the instructors noticed that she walked away to another class or was off in a corner away from everyone just playing by herself the instructors neglect in engaging with the children all i have seen them do is spot the children on the equipment they do not have any kind of activities for the children to do together as a class they do nothing to make their learning experience a fun experience i'm not trying to tell anyone how to do their jobs but perhaps it could be beneficial to divide the kids into two groups one group per instructor and start at two different stations rotating together keeping the kids into two groups instead of four-five maybe that way the kids can each possibly get more attention from the instructor and even be kept an eye on more easily i don't know if it would work but its a suggestionthey definitely need to rethink what they can do to better organize the class as a whole and better engage the kids it would be appreciated for them to evaluate what they can do to maximize the services they are being paid for i absolutely did not respect one of the instructors putting my daughter on a time out during a class he said she was too hyper and he didn't want she or any of the kids to get hurt so he put her on a time out to calm down i understand that he was thinking of their safety but i didn't believe a time out was fair because honestly if they had been paying more attention they would have noticed her standing in line waiting to be helped for almost 10mins before she decided to have free play and each time she went to another station she would wait for so long before getting bored can you blame her (or any other kid) she's only 4 five minutes to them is equivalent to 30-60 minutes i am not upset about the time out itself i do believe in discipline i care that she got put in time out for entertaining herself due to the lack or organization by the instructors truthfully the class looks like 'free play' being monitored by instructors who only help them on the equipmentafter they wait and wait and wait until one of them are available they could improve their class by adding activities and games that relate to gymnastics and can help bring the class together as a whole alsoi can't stress this enoughthe instructors really need to engage with the children rather than just "spotting" them on the equipment fortunately i used a groupon deal before deciding to register for regular classes she has one more class to complete and then we will be looking into other gymnastic businesses  i am exceptionally disappointed with the experience my daughter has had with this company fortunately she is only 4 so she doesn't know the difference but she will absolutely not be returning
0,experience with rico's martial arts studio has led me to believe that tae kwan do is korean for  "let's see how much money we can squeeze out of our members before they quit" their turnover rate is very high due to all of the hidden fees associated with attending class there from mandatory uniform changes with outrageously priced clothing($50 for kids shorts) to overpriced mandatory equipment to advancing students 12 belt at a time so you have to pay double for each rank increase these guys know all the tricksi would only recommend this place if you are a recent lottery winner or if you don't mind feeling like you are getting robbed 3 times a weekaside from that i found the program to be satisfactory
0,martial arts is a total rip off mickey rico will shake your hand while going straight for your wallet they are constantly up selling everything there everthing you do there costs more and more money the last straw for me was when they started giving half-belts that way they can charge you twice as much twice as often  i don't know how they sleep at night mickey rico would be better suited as a used car salesman
0,drives me crazy how many of my friends are tricked into going to this dump i hate this bar if i wanted to pay scottsdale prices for drinksi would go to scottsdale i know its crazy oh i have to pay cover to get into a bar in tempe ha what a joke people please stop being duped into going here the only people who should be going to this pit are kids for their power hour or people taking their parents out to drink when they are in town cuz your mom would like it
0,know that feeling of being taken advantage of the morning after a one night stand well i have it after going to this placeabout 15 of us girls went there to celebrate a birthday we got there early (7:50pm)  and were surprised by the $800 cover we argued that it was not 8 yet but their clocks are what they go by oh well we each paid it and then desperately tried to find a table - what a joke we ended up at two high-top tables in the very back with a big ceiling support blocking half the stage the drink prices are very high (scottsdale high) the bathrooms are disgusting and small and the piano players beg constantly for tips another disappointment was the 2 male piano players went on break shortly after we got there and a female singer took their place she is good but there is something wrong about hearing a female sing elton john and billy joel leave the girl songs to the girl and the boy songs to the boysanyway 2 hours later we were out of cash and annoyed by the high alto singing - we left and won't be backsave yourself some money - go to a local bar and listen to karoke
0,place is pure crap the players are sub-par and un-entertaining  (especially mike clement and julie martinez)   and the door men are ridiculously cheesy and rude i'm a regular at piano bars all over the country when i'm traveling (pete's piano bar in austin howl at the moon in scottsdale) and the big bang in tempe is a terrible destination save your tips and bar $ for the aforementioned places and take my word for it
0,the big bang another chance have always enjoyed it someone needs to take the steriods out of the bouncers drinks i went in with my bf (he was stone cold sober) and was turned away at the door apparently we were too drunk are you kidding me big bang your service has always sucked but i forgave that since i liked the music i'm not a co-ed so please don't treat me like one i'm more than happy to spend my money elsewhere
0,travel to arizona all the time and tend to end up at mill ave i have tried to go to the big bang and all i have to say is classless they think they are so pretentious they kick you out if you seem to be having a good time but really they are just rude and the bouncers think that they are better than everyone in that place they have a cover charge which i think is rediculous i will not be going therethere are so many other great bars on mill that i can enjoy a drink with out feeling like they make me feel (low class)
0,i went to meet up with people the guys at the top of the stairs let me in because i didn't have cash my boyfriend found cash and paid anyways for both of us we went down the stairs to enter the place and our friends walked out we promptly walked back up the stairs and asked for a refund since we didn't go in the building the employees collecting fees said no they were rude and uncaring i asked for the manager and they laughed talk about a rip off never going back never recommending this place and never saying good things about it
0,we got the groupon and reserved a good table the music was awesome and the service was fast our entire group had a good time until the check came each of our tables paid our tabs and tipped at least 18% everything was cool until the waitress came back and spoke with our tables individually and solicited us for larger tips  she kept asking if her service wasn't good and if it wasn't she wouldn't have gotten nearly what she got she wouldn't go away and kept insisting we didn't tip her i've never been solicited for tips when we obviously gave her enough and its not the first time i've heard this happen at the big bang its like they were taught to do that we will never be back
0,off the piece of garbage so called bouncer said my picture wasn't me i retorted really he said yes this isn't you do you have a debit card or credit card with your name i provided the proof but like i told him my id name is different from my real name thanx ssa but my picture still looked like me sans long hair anyway we were told no cover charge and we were given two free drink tickets mr garbage bouncer who will remain unnamed said no we don't accept those even though it had their name and were laminated by the clubi asked why they had canvassers out on the street tonight handing these out he said to get people to come to the club but they don't accept the cardsthen he stated that i didn't have to give him attitude i said asking questions and calling them on their false advertising practices was being rudedon't waste your time or money on this establishment
0,used to be my favorite bar  had scheduled to have my bachelorette party there  even send out evites to all my friends  all i did was smile and show my "bride to be" sash to the doorman  he rudely deemed my unfit to enter even though 3 other where more than happy to help me and my party celebrate my special night
0,is the worst place on mill ave we decided to purchase 2 tables for my roommates graduation party and for some reason one of the dweeb bouncers kicked out the graduate for "pushing him" my roommate was respectful when the bouncer asked him to get off the stage immediately and his response was to remove him from the bar i was standing directly behind it when the ordeal happened and that was not the real story the bouncer lied to the head bouncer and had the entire party removed also the tv monitor's picture that is airing the stage has the worst quality picture i've ever seen might as well throw a black and white tv on the wall what kind of establishment removes a group of 20+ people for their employees' feelings getting hurt we brought business to them and now we will never be back the place is hurting for business trying to charge a $2 cover fee jon taffer needs to get in here asap big bang more like bitch bang
0,will never ever go back here end of story i went with the boyfriend right after it opened in feb '08 it was some special neither of us paid cover and it was $5 cosmos for ladies the funny thing is my beer drinking bf ordered a cosmo and received it for $5 maybe the waitress thought this funny or something i sure did anyway the music was out of sync between the two piano players the kitchen was closed and it was only 10 or 11 pm and the guy playing the piano reminded me of a super annoying joe pesci with his dumb jokes they embarrassed some drunk girl on her birthday with really vulgar stuff i'm not a prude in fact i'm pretty foul mouthed and minded but if this guy said that stuff to me i probably would have knocked him right off his piano stool we finished the only drink we ordered payed our bill and booked it to the yardhouse to enjoy the reverse happy hour and some beer
0,charge was too expensive drinks were very weak  one of the piano players sam ferguson what a detroit punk we had to pay him three times to get one request up and i am talking at 10-15 bucks a pop  my advice to anyone going there is to sneak in a flask of whatever your drinking do not pay sam ferguson for any requests  james brown and scott doyle are the best  complain about the cover charge
0,saturday night and the bf's 30th birthday  a group of us decided to head to the shout house since it was fun the last time we went (nov 2008)  this time however was not enjoyable  we got there around 9pm and paid our cover  we were lucky enough to find a table that was a good distance from the stage   after about 20 minutes a waitress finally came over for our order  we got a round of beer and water - the water never came and it took another 20 minutes to get the beer  the place was not crowded so i'm not sure what the hold up was   as we were drinking our beer we could not help but notice the table next to us: about half a dozen middle aged single women that were incredibly drunk and overweight that were grinding on each other  then the painist introduced an engaged couple - yet again a middle aged overweight couple dry humping and grabbing each other on stage  we all became disgusted and hurried to finish our drinks  we all agreed to leave  on our way out the birthday boy asked to speak to the manager - he complained about the waitress and then asked about a free birthday cover  the manager said that if you let them know when you are in line then yes you can get in for free  they do not advertise this so the birthday boy asked for a refund for his cover  the manager would not comp him  he stated that they do not give refunds  this manager needs to work on his customer service skills  it was his birthday afterall - why be a dick and lose business  i can't see myself coming back here ever
0,is my two  word opinion of the shout house:  never againfirst of all you have two guys banging on pianos at the top of their lungs  not for me  major headache after a couple hours there  majorhowever for those with not such great hearing it would be a fun place to spend an eveningthe service is horrid and the waitresses are slow and seemingly uncaring for the most part but nobody will care if they are having fun i think  i definitely wasn't more and more as  the evening wore onif you don't hear so well as i seem to you will just love this fun enthusiastic placei was there at the beginning of a friday night until maybe 9pm  i understand it gets more raunchy as the night wore on  this was my mistake going there so early  i'd rather get a few laughs from the raunchy cause early in the evening it was waaaay too tame for me personally but to each their owna gal i know with meetupcom complained it was way too vulgar at the end of the evening  she's been coddled obviously and was probably mortified if anyone said "poop"  so like i said to each their ownit was the constant loud noise that burned me out and not the bad service or the non-rauncy lyrics i heard  this i guess is one of the downfalls of having better than normal hearingcrap
0,it a second try i am still at my first conclusion it's loud bathrooms filthy strange location upstairs expensive and the quality of bartenders is subpar (extremely subpar)who is running this place anyways i think no-oneeek methinks not
0,worst food ever i've been sick for two days after two bites of the tacos when will it end ugh okay drinks kind of watery
0,westgate rip offyou gotta pay to get inthe bartenders are clueless and inept when it come to makeing drinksthe piano players are terriblethey just bang the keys and yell the lyrics almost trying to sound bad its really grating on the earsits not fun its not coolskip it
0,enjoy the finer things in life  the music of air supply the films of michael bay and fine dining  so when i drunkenly stumbled across the shout house one evening i knew this place was right up my alleyi got into the restaurant and was told to sit wherever i please  that's always a sign of a classy restaurant freedom to do as you want america style  i sat outside because i wanted to make sure that as many people as possible saw me eating there  i was not disappointed  i can't even tell you how many people walked by saying "you're in for the worst experience of your life"  i knew they were just jealous  the waitress whose name escapes me (because of the aforementioned drunkenness) took about ten minutes to decide to come to our table  i like it when restaurants seem to have a policy of making their patrons wait  it just amps up the anticipation  i ordered a blue moon because i had already had eleven jack and cokes before breakfast and figured it was time to slow down  i had just come from church for chrissakestaste is not a thing i enjoy so when my blue moon arrived watered down fifteen minutes later (more waiting :d) i was particularly excited  "mmmm this is totally worth $5" i thought  "i'm glad you like it" replied my striking blonde () waitress  "did i say that out loud" i said back  i really can't stress enough how drunk i was"you did  you've also been ranting about communists since you came in and i think you peed your pants""you have a good eye sir""i'm a woman"we sat there in silence for four minutes"food" i said  "i want food"this startled the waitress and she screamed"feed me""yes fine  what will it be""cheeseburger and fries  medium""done deal"forty minutes later my burger showed up  some people like to compare food to heaven others hell  "mmmm this is purgatory" i exclaimed  "there's absolutely nothing notable about this food at all and look you forgot the cheese i knew it would bring too much spice to my meal"half an hour later my ginger () waitress returned with the check  "wow all this for only $40" i said"i expect a good tip" my waitress who i think had black hair said"oh you'll get a good tip" i replied  as soon as she walked away i got up and left because i suddenly remembered i had no moneyi would definitely recommend the shout house to anyone who likes watered down beer burgers that taste like water and waiting aroundi just remembered my waitress was a brunette  and a man
0,have been to piano bars all around the country from miami to cali and back and this was by far and without a doubt the crapiest one  i genuinely like piano bars since they can be a really fun place to blow off steam while enjoying a good show; not here  never a good sign that the place was pretty empty on a saturday night the weekend of cinco de mayo and the kentucy derby but nonetheless i and four other guests sat down  i can easily handle the unstable tables or that all of the chairs felt like they were just about the break apart i'm actually good with that  i can even handle the fact that it took our waitress almost 20 minutes to just say hi as she walked by to another table  i would even go so far to say i can handle the horrible tasting food it's a bar right your there for fun not a gastronomic awakening  what made this place the crapiest piano bar in the united states was the continuous barry manilow cover songs with an interspersed elton john number- and they were horrible at both  the drinks are very short pours let me say this again since it bears repeating- the bartenders short pour you to the point of being offensive  i went up to the bar (which was empty as well i can see pattern forming here) and was met by a young man who was giving me the "what the hell do you want" stare   i asked to have my martini look like a martini and not a  12 shot in a martini glass  his reply was "well that's what you get unless you pay for more"  holly crap what a horrible place  here's the bill lowdown- 2 martini's 2 grey goose mandarin and sprites- total bill-------- $72  that's before tip (which they sure as hell don't deserve) or anything else since i paid for the burger with cash at delivery  there are a ton of other great piano bars in the valley and there are some good bars in the glendale area just stay away from this shit hole  i would bet $20 that this place is closed by the health department within a year that is unless it goes out of business for being such a disappointment  do not go to the shout house in glendale az  chewing tin foil would be more fun than going back there
0,away  far away  go if you want to be insulted and not valued as a customerwe went with a group on a wed (very slow) night to listen to some music and have a nightcapwe left when we were told "you are the oldest people here" (we are in our 40's) and didn't care to sing along to a song before our timethe manager even apologized for the poor form of the piano players if they were astute business people they would have realized that their "oldest" customers had the most amount of disposable income to spend there   as such we took our money and found another place where they welcomed our businessnever again
0,montreal it seems to be normal to charge good money for mediocre to poisonous food we're it not for my favourite cheap and cheerfuls (thali thai express and a few others) i would never eat out at allthis evening a friend of mine wanted to go for a bite i was really just looking for a coffee while he ate we ended up at the griffintown because it was close and looked reasonably appealingonce seated i checked out the menu and though i wasn't hungry i saw pulled pork tacos and couldn't resist now -- i should know better as there is one thing you can be sure of -- no one in montreal actually knows how to cook much less something as tasty as pulled porkmy pal ordered a burger and when he specified no bacon what do you know he got bacon -- strike 1my pulled pork arrived and it was cold: trichinosis anyone strike 2 i sent it back and at that moment i realized that griffintown was another over-hyped under serving restauranti didn't want anything else to eat as god knows what goes on in that kitchen but making food is obviously not their fortethe final strike was the out of tune bad sounding piano being beaten by some woman who required sheet music to play old standards and her accompanist a microphoned double basswould i go there again bzzzt the only saving grace was they comp'd our meal which when you think about it thats about what it was worth -- nothing
0,brunch place the service was terrible walked in no one greeted us after 5mins of standing in the entrance waitress told us to sit anywhere we sat down at a table and waited another 15 minutes to get menus the waiter then told us we didn't sit at the right place and that we should of waited for someone to seat usonce we ordered the wait was reasonable although we had all finished our plates before the waiter brought us our drinks terrible experience terrible service many much better places in the area don't waste your money here
0,a long time to get our food - and it was served cold and no flavor - don't get the 'mexican dish' - whatever you do - service was alright - they did comp me my beer - will give them another try - pretty pricey - 30 bucks for mac and cheese and a beer

0,to clarify my rating for this business is not based on the quality of their work but based on their service the problem i had with them is that i never got any service i called them on a thursday to see if they can do a rush order for me because i needs shirts made by sunday the service rep promised everything will be done by friday and that he'd call me to let me know it's done he called on friday afternoon to tell me that it won't be done until saturday and he'll come in on saturday to finish the job of course no calls on saturday and sunday so i missed the deadline where i could've order from another place and actually got the shirts in time the rep finally called me on monday to "confirm" that i still want the shirts wow thanks sherlock i needed those shirts bleeping yesterdayanyways i don't recommend businesses that over-promise and under-deliver
0,had the same problem as allan h i was not in any kind of rush for my shirts i gave them 2 weeks to print my shirts i got no calls on the day the shirts were suppose to be ready i left several phone messages and finally sales person called me back he wanted to see if i still want my shirts print  can't count on this place
0,a hardcore knitter and whoever was working behind the register it was a man couldn't have been bothered with customers that day didn't say hello didn't ask if i needed help or even acknowledge my existence when i walked out and said oh well thanks have a great day i didn't even hear anything back so sad
0,time i tried them second time disappointed the wait is long with no seating but more importantly work mediocre had them embroider military labels despite being specific and spelling name out it was misspelled after the clerk argued he realized and said he'd fix within 15 minutes 45 minutes later i left as i had an appointment when i returned the job was shoddy and it was clear they simply removed the transposed letters and the new ones didn't line up evenly with the existing text never will i return the owner didn't even apologize
0,you remember the crappy apartment you rented in college or grad school  the one with the bad ac and dirty carpet  the one with the barely functioning electrical outlets and tiny almost useless kitchen  well if you ever want to relive that experience stay at shadyside inn suitesi spent six years of my medical training in pittsburgh and found myself with a few days off last month  why not take my wife and young son back to my old stomping grounds in oakland and shadyside  we've found that when traveling with a young child staying at suite-type hotels (with at least some sort of kitchen facilities and a separate bedroom) is very useful  the most convenient suite-type hotel to shadyside is the shadyside inn suites  unfortunately since this business has a virtual monopoly on the area it must believe it can put its clients up in deplorable nearly unsafe conditions these comments are based on our experience with the building on s negley ave  i believe there are at least two other buildings the hotel maintains as well as "mansion suites" which are reserved for vip's or people staying for very long periodsgeneral complaints:1  exposed electrical and cable wiring (see pics)  we tried to spend as little time as possible in the room because i didn't want our 19 month old to inadvertently touch exposed wires2  dirt  everywhere  when we were getting ready to leave i did a quick last run through the room to make sure we weren't leaving any of my sons toys behind  i made the mistake of peeking underneath the couch  yuck  food remnants dirt and debris from who knows how long under there  disgusting3  general poor maintenance of the building and its parking lot (see pics)4  the furniture in the rooms looks like it has been there for at least 15 years  our dining table was strikingly similar to the one i had in college5  no dishwashers  not unexpected given the age of the building  but if you're not going to give your guests a dishwasher at least give us sponges so we can wash our own6  when you check in the hotel bills your credit card for the entire length of the stay ahead of time rather than vice versa (completely the opposite of every other hotel in this country)  keep this in mind if you want to leave early after seeing the condition of your room7  three separate keys are required to get into the building and your room  again completely out of date and not particularly securealso the vaunted customer service that they crow about on their website must be limited to special guests and celebrities 1  when we asked for an extra blanket to be delivered to our room we waited for over an hour with no response  ultimately we had to drive back to the main office and retrieve the blanket ourselves2   the remote to the dvdvcr combo had no batteries in it  i had to get the aa batteries from the main office (i didn't even bother to attempt to ask them to be delivered to our room) and had to wait while the office staff repeatedly found aaa batteries for me  i was told the aaa batteries fit the flat screen tv remotes in the rooms  i had to calmly explain that we did not have a flat screen tv in our room rather we had a non hd crt tv that was at least 10 years old 3  daily cleaning of the room costs extra  be sure to read the fine printperhaps some of its other buildings are more modern and in better condition  perhaps we had the worst unit in the entire complex but i doubt itunless you absolutely have to be within walking distance to a business client or family in shadyside do yourself a favor and find a more modern cleaner safer and better hotel  shadyside inn suites should be ashamed of itself for the condition of its facilities(61110) update shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay  they report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilities
0,shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay  they report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilitiesin response to the manager's comments:  as i noted above they refunded our stay  the tv cabling is exposed perhaps not as dangerous as exposed electrical wire but not something to be particularly proud of if you consider yourself to be a business built on customer service and the impression of luxury the "ongoing" repairs in the hallways were not touched during our (middle of the week) stay so one must wonder about the urgency of those repairs   the building we stayed in was not full  why did they put my family in the oldest most dilapidated room as far as moving to a different room any one who has traveled with children would know how difficult  it is to move from one hotel (or hotel room) to another  we arrived after a 3+ hour drive at 5pm in the middle of a thunderstorm with a very tired and cranky toddler  given the relative level of competence at the front desk at the time of check in we weren't confident that any room we would be moved to would be any betteri stand behind my review  if i could give the place zero stars i would
0,granting one star because there's no way to give noneas i write this the door to my room is open and two burly gentlemen are drilling and hammering and drilling and hammering--i just checked and it's going to go on all day evidently the inn is installing a new lock system and for some reason it was impossible to wait until i checked out later today counting on solitude and quiet i'd brought work to do but it's now utterly impossible to concentrate i stayed here once before and loved it but this lack of concern and respect sets a a new low
0,stayed at the shadyside inn for months and spent thousands of dollars i really wanted to write a good review but the experience was disappointing the quality of service from the staff was inconsistent some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude when we provided feedback to the manager (carol s) she was extremely disrespectful she was not receptive to customer feedback at all and her response was very unprofessional to say the least we also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall)  and the elevator did not work at timeswe will not stay at this hotel again
0,so muchwhile the building level of service and rooms were in line with a typical holiday inn the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and priority club customerbrief summary of my horror story - we check in we get the wrong room  they move us give us keys to a filthy room  we bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean itwe get back to the room and i check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329  after spending about an hour on the phone with my bank we trace the charges to the holiday inn i am staying at via the card that i have left for incidentalsdespite prepaying for the room we've now given the holiday inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110  night roomfurthermore the banks had closed so i couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend  it wasn't that i didn't have access to cash but i had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guyswhen i bring it up at the front desk i am immediately given run around  they pull up my info on their computer and gasp as they see their error  the staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake they simply blamed a computer error  i finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue and i don't receive any further communication as i'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekendthe next day of my stay i call the front desk again and demand answers  this manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue  she spent time on the phone with my bank and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome holiday inn's costly errorafter dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend  i demand to only pay half of my hotel bill which is immediately granted  by then i was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensationultimately don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account which could cash screw you for the weekend  also don't stay at holiday inns because the staff and management is comprised of lazy lying and incompetent thievesthat is all
0,is the second time that my husband and i have stayed at this hotel  both experiences have been terrible  the staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile  the decor is bright and nice but it is not maintained very well  the lobby could use a good cleaning  also there is a $15day charge for parking at this hotel  the location is great you can walk to pretty much anywhere but it is very noisy even on higher floors  we were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room jj told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had  we felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online  then when we got to the room the faucet was so loose it fell over  it was fixed promptly but made a bad first impression  neither time my husband and i have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience  i would strongly recommend staying at one of charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience
0,possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life noisy dirty poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man the way i was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place doesn't even deserve one star in my book avoid at all costs
0,i booked a hotel room here for new years eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before i was staying there my credit card was charged for the room  i was treated like an idiot by carmen who answered the phone  she kept saying that i should have known but i would not have been so upset if i had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted  make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room  would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way i have been treated
0,had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived all the way through to the time we left  it's actually quite sad because i'd like to share the information but i'd rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place  it's awful and we won't be going back  the worst of our experience  let's just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room while we were in it with the privacy sign on pretty much sealed the deal here  if anyone's had theft problems this may be why  hotel staff was quick to throw out "sorry" for each thing that went wrong but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said (i didn't want to give this place any stars but one star is needed to submit this review)
0,clear of this hotel  mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses bar is way overpriced  there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one
0,this one
0,has got to be the most overrated restaurant in charlotte i've been 3 times and i have never been impressed  but this last time was horrible this is the mcdonald's of cajun cuisine every dish we had was completely flavorless fortunately it was only half price because of the groupon that i used and even at half off it was overpriced relative the to the exceptionally low quality of the food i'll never go back
0,have been to this place plenty of times i have always had good meals and service but tonight was bad i went ther with my wife's work friends we sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named bo(very red hair)   we had about 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food which we had planned to do he seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was friday and happy hour so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but bo seemed very disinterested in us until it came time to pay the bill then he was really nice(tip time overall the food is good there but bo did not make it a pleasant experience smile bo it will get you far in life
0,was our first visit to this restaurant it boasts a louisiana  style menu however this dish ( cajun platter) lacked any type of cajun spices you can't serve red beans and rice with no gravy  and consider that to be a  louisiana style dish my husband ordered the new york strip and had to put salt on it because there was no flavor i certainly have had better and i would not visit again overrated
0,charlotte from los angeles while husband is in town for business the good: the upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere people are talking loud and enjoying themselves have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time we each had a glass of wine the sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal not the shrimp the sauce with bread dipped inthe bad: food is mediocre we had the cajun popcorn which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce good but on the salty side tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead the sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place uneaten we each had a cup of seafood gumbo there is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless we ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and i got a side order of grits the sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth the shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture the final insult: the grits grits are a favorite food of mine i'm a southern girl and make real deal bomb-azz grits at home the grits at cajun queen were those instant "add boiling water to reconstitute" grits culinary blasphemyi will not return if you want real grits go to mert's heart and soul
0,incredibly let down by this dining experience our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts meanwhile the food was terrible the fried green tomatoes lacked any kind of seasoning and the crawfish etouffee was bland and not at all spicy the tollhouse cookie pie was also a travesty how does one mess up a cookie pie at least the key lime pie was good but not worth the $250 dollar bill :(
0,not waste your money the gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever i ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking "no one can mess up blackened chicken"i was wrong none of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper this was the most bland overpriced food i'd ever had in the city i ordered my toddler the chicken strip little gators meal the fries were the best thing out of the entire meal the service was as also dry and not very friendly or inviting from the hostess to the waiter brandon geez i know it's a tuesday night (we arrived at 5:30) but at least show some enthusiasm as i arrive to spend a whopping $123 (4 entrees 4 alcoholic bevs 1 kids meal) on a below average meal it would've been more had we been charged for the uneaten cup of gumbo
0,take everyone that comes to visit me to cajun queen  from the great food (my favorite is the bbq shrimp and bread to dip into the sauce) to the live jazz and great service this is a restaurant not to be missed
0,people please beware i've been a patron of cajun queen for over a decade but my experience tonight was humiliating i treated my sister to  a birthday dinner and despite our online reservation we were asked to leave in  the most demeaning of ways i have a debilitating childhood disease and use a wheelchair on occasion ; tonight was one such occasion i could only order food i knew didn't require cutting so i opted for potatoes and a salad my sister ordered a full meal with wine i had two mixed drinks (so we're not cheap diners) we had to signal for another glass of wine for my sister despite seeing the party next to us being served appropriately i'm not sure why we were overlooked but i'm left to wonder if it's the small portion i ordered that was disparaginganyway when my sister went to look upstairs a minute to reminisce our server asked my sister quite off the cuff "do you want help with 'her' (wheel)chair i kinda need that table"taken aback my sister said "no" we took note of the empty tables on both sides of us and the fact that the restaurant wasn't crazy busy as we remembered i spent $67 on a tab for two  and left a tip of $20--clearly more than twenty percenti don't know many people who tip as graciously as i  do my reasoning for leaving the tip despite the service was it being christmas time and it's something i do for goodwillwhen we rolled to the handicap ramp it was completely (i mean completely) blocked off by an a-frame sign about parking; see for yourself had  my sister not been with me i would have not been able to access the restaurant at alli haven't  always been disabled and ran a restaurant myself (loved every minute of it) i know how people can take advantage (campers) and i know people can be uber-cheap at tipping i don't fall into  either ilk i know good service when i see it; i know how to approach diners who overstay their 'welcome (their can never be anyone who overstay their welcome; consider it flattery); it's part of doing business and keeping patrons happy  take a loss here and there we were in and home in a little over two hours the couple beside us with the adorable little girl who  laid all over the booth was fine by me; she's a child and cq is a noisy place i felt a sting of angst when i asked for my food to be wrapped the facial gestures were quite unsettlingplease don't tell me i'm sensitive: i've had over forty surgeries--two with no painkillers afterwards i've walked on a broken leg to buy wrapping paper tape been accosted because i wasn't 'messed up' "enough'" to ''deserve a handicap tag so enough ---but there's  no excuse for inhospitably between diner and those needing  to use the facilities''please let these be a isolated parents'please leave :)
0,loud bad service and the food doesn't met the expectations we came w a party of 10 people we didn't even get menus for a while it was so loud we could hardly listen to our server dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time super disappointed
0,place is like the equivalent of the clubhouse in tempe but in phoenix the layout makes no sense and the character of the building is incredibly old and out dated especially with as many good acts and money they bring in its time to reinvest your money to renovateimprove they pull in great acts but almost always the venue pushes me away from seeing them not worth it
0,i am the most "uncool" person on yelp but i hated this place  a friend and i decided to meet here thinking it sounded like a chill place to have a drink relax go down memory lane etcwe drove separately and i arrived before him  i paid a $10 cover to get inside only to discover that "inside" was so dark i could not see so packed i could not move and playing the most insanely loud i-don't-even-know-what-to-call-it music i have ever heardtrying not to be a diva i went to the bar and ordered a jack on the rocks  it took me screaming at the bartender to accomplish this feat likely through no fault of his ownanyway my buddy showed up and miraculously recognized my silhouette in the dark  (i am a perfectly normal size 1012 so i didn't stand out at all)  he ordered a drink and we stood in awkward pitch-black booming silence until we decided to just slam our drinks and leavethat was the most interesting $15+ dollar jack (including cover) i have ever hadi don't see the appeal  maybe on a weekday
0,were scheduled to go with an events group of around 35 people my friend and i got there 40 minutes early a man that appeared to work for the place was propping the door open and greeted us we milled around and listened to the band run some practices and sounds test we talked to the bartender about food and was told she could give us some menus for pizza delivery we waited about 40 minutes for the rest of our group at 7 (opening time) we were approached and told we were not suppose to be in there and asked to leave the man didn't offer to  our $5 entrance fee or walk us to a waiting area he just asked us to leave so we did outside  there were people milling around but it appeared our group would make up the majority of the patrons for the evening we did not know that what appeared to be a front entrance was not the front entrance no one stopped us or came up to us for 40 minutes it was not a weekend i tried calling but no one picked up and i tried to find an email address with no luck i doubt i will return unless they contact me and explain themselves if my employee talked to someone in that matter i would fire them when i told the man i will never come back he shrugged what amounted to a misunderstanding was handled with extreme rudeness and with a complete disregard to our future business i will be informing our event coordinator of how we were  treated as well the group does events every night of the week i hope he removes this one from our future schedules all we saw was a dirty club with torn bar stools
0,your money gas and time  over priced and food took way too long to get to our table  i went once before and it was ok the second time i was sad i spent datenight here with friends  i was embarrassed we suggested this place  you want great chicken go to lolos in phoenix  sorry
0,if you cuss the bartender will correct your word choice and possibly kick you out don't get me wrong there's no need for gratuitous cursing but it's called "colorful language" for a reason -- it adds affect besides this is an adult establishment right where are the impressionable children and easily offended nuns p*ss offas my accomplice said "this place is a f*cking time warp" (luckily out of ear-shot of the bartender) that wasn't meant as a compliment rather an observation of the tacky lounge-jazz on the juke box and inordinate amount of gaudy tiger decor filling up every square inch of wall space gag meif i'm brought back here i'll be the one kicking and screaming in defiance*for the record i did not get kicked out i just didn't like the feeling of having to watch my language so closely when i'm go figure at a bar
0,place is not wheelchair accessible  there is no disabled parking the ramp to get on the sidewalk is on the complete opposite side of the parking lot and then as you attempt to push someone in a wheelchair to their entrance the path is constantly blocked  things certainly don't improve once you finally make it in  the whole thing is a joke  good music sure if you can get there
0,a horrible experience last night they had a halloween costume party on one side  and bollywood night on the other the security seeing we were desi's asked us to go to the other side will never return
0,the crepe was very good and our waiter was a kind young lady our seemingly great experience turned into a bitter one when a rude monsieur told me to walk out or throw away a partial sandwich i had in my bag that i was going to finish from my breakfast earlier i understand if you would like to point out that it might not be allowed in this establishment considering i was completely unaware of it but if our table is still consuming from the restaurant as well i personally would consider it twice before interrupting what seemed to be a lovely afternoon snack with such an unwelcoming display of service would not recommend this location
0,service just terrible before our drinks even came there was a bird pooping onto our table but the staff couldn't care less (perhaps because we're an "ethnic" family) both the wait staff and someone who i assume is the manager were extremely rude and very unapologetic sure they couldn't do anything about the bird but they could have at the very least let us move the table slightly to avoid unwanted filth falling directly into our food and drinks after a long while of this absurdity the staff (very reluctantly) moved us to another table (inside this time) by this point though this place had completely ruined our mood both by the staff's deliberate avoidance of our issues and their continued insolence as a party of 7 we ordered a variety of dishes again the food was not only subpar but actually unenjoyable in fact we all concluded that we had had substantially better food elsewhere overall not going back somehow their blatant ignorance of our concerns during the service and the unapologetic 'gtfo' attitude towards us (and to no other patrons present there at the time) is quite evident of a very bigotedly racist attitude embodied in this rather unremarkable eatery as a paying customer it's disappointing to be treated as a 'lesser person' in this day and age
0,experience with a hairdresser ever at this location made an appointment with diane for a body wave when i was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said "you get body waves" yeah that's why i booked one at your salon then she argued with me about when to trim i wanted after she wanted before and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter but first telling me the perm "wouldn't soak in" on the ends unless she trimmed it then she argued with me about the rods it's taken me over ten years to figure out with aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is diane knew better but finally agreed then she proceeded to comb my wet hair from the forehead back scratching my scalp and jerking my head that wasn't enough though she then started rolling it with the rods she thought i should have  i got up and left when i addressed the problem at the front no effort was made to help me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner yeah right that's gonna happen horrible salondirty also just as a side note
0,went here for the first time on a recommendation i did not request a specific stylist and told them i could do an appointment "any time this week" i received a decent cut but left promising the receptionist that i would never returnonline their women's haircut price is quoted at $30+ i get a very basic cut so i expected it to be $30 $35 at most only when i checked out was i informed that my cut was actually $44 when i asked why the cost was so much higher than their base quote the receptionist told me the cost is based on the experience of the stylist my stylist -- the one chosen for me without revealing this policy -- has been working at the salon for 13 yearsi understand this unit of commensuration -- although i think it's bad for business because it insinuates a customer will receive a much lower quality experience if the stylist is younger however if this is a salon policy it is one that should be clearly stated upon scheduling the appointmentfrom my perspective la pomponnee preyed upon my naivety and (seemingly deliberately) chose the most expensive stylist this is downright terrible customer service and it will be the reason they eliminated any chance of a long-term relationship
0,was new in town and needed an eyebrow wax i found the spa at ballantyne and decided to give it a try although i received a skewer of yummy pinneaple while i was waiting for my technician that was the highlight of my expereince we got in the room and after what seemed like just two strips pulled off she said i was done she didn't have a mirror in the room so she said i could use a metal bowl to try and see my reflection or we could go into the bathroom and she could tweeze and strays in there are you kiddingthis wouldnt have been so bad if it was super cheap but the waxing was $20 and then they add automatic tip on there so it came to $24 there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money
0,was so surprised as to the level of disappointment i experienced at this spa my best friend and i (she flew in from nj for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages both of us choosing hot stone we both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places nj ny california to name a fewhere are my main issues:1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak english we ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time when we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water) we get a 'yes' i ask again are they hot we get a yes she leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold we find the hot tub figure it out ourselves and the jets which do not move are facing straight up therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles it was a joke2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile i thought i was in a hospital3- my massage was all about the stones my very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes she didn't massage anything i kept on waiting for the manipulation to start thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second then we were done what the heck  my friend's massage included an actual massage4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers there is no tranquil anything about this 'room' no soft lighting no blankets (i was quite chilly) no anything to make me feel i was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time5- the pleasure of this experience and i use that term kindly cost me a whopping $175  i haven't felt this ripped off in a very long timeif you are used to a special experience and you feel you deserve to be pampered and be made to feel good do not go here unless you don't care where your money goes
0,i mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints i was surprised when i received a phone call from the director he wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition updating the spa etc he refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place we were looking forward to a great experience as promised and i fully planned on updating my rating here on yelpso i called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa i left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call i guess the good service left with the director
0,2 - spoke with the new spa manager and she promises a great experience for my friend and me i will update
0,takes a lot for me to give a nasty review and this place earns iti was in town for a mini reunion - 4 of my friends from all over the us met here to catch up (after 20 years)  i have lived all over the world and appreciate spa's of all sorts and facilitiesand always the main thing comes back to servicefirst the greeting here was nice  we had reservations for our treatments and confirmed at the desk then went on the tour the facilities are wonderful  very posh  beautiful pools indoor and out and the spa was relaxing and comfortablenow with posh places they can often miss the point of actual "treatment"  but keep in mind i go to a korean spa in los angeles and get an old lady to scrub me down like a little dirty kid so that my skin glows  still i expect the actual treatmentso i had a massage  can't go wrong with that - right  wellmaybe you can  i choose the only man on staff as i like a strong massage  i can honestly say that he spent more time adjusting my blanket a million times then he did actually rubbing me  it was almost annoying  i was ready to rip the blanket off  i'm here for a rub down not fluffy adjustment of the blanket and how it covers me lol  so whateverwhen i got back i asked my friends if their treatments were nice  all said "ok" and i had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain  one did complain  she said that she didn't get the hot oil head treatment  oh that's sucky - because it is an add on service and costs a little bit  but she really wanted it  well it's not missing it that pissed me offit's what the lady told her  she basically told my friend "well i totally forgot and i don't have timebut what a shame cuz i do a really good treatment"  well if that isn't the biggest f-you ever  she should have taken the time to do itthen we go to pay  wellnow here is the part that totally had me trumped  like i said i've been to spas on every single corner of this earth and never before have i seen this done  they basically add a 20% gratuity  they pre add it  then they say to you "well if you feel you want to give them less we can change it"  wow wow wow  so are you really suppose to feel like an jerk and say they deserve less  so first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the service she didn't get then said she did want to tip less since the girl made her feel bad  they said to her "well you know the tip get's shared by all of us"  oh my lord  my turn  i say to her well i've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats  we all would have paid it anyhow but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths  i paid and didn't fightbut thenthere was a local man standing in line waiting to pay too  he said to the girl"what can i bitch about to try to get a discount"  wow  is this really how these locals act  he didn't know our situation  he didn't know how we were treated  so my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business  the girl behind the counter laughedoh no  in the car my friend called several times to speak to a manager  they kept sending her to voicemail she left two voicemails  no call backyou can have the prettiest little southern spot and posh trimmings but the meat is your treatments and your service  in my booked you failed on both
0,treated my mom and myself to sea pearl facials bottoms up pedicures and luxury manicures on april 1st 2014 at the spa i have lived in the ballantyne area for years; however this was my first visit to the spa at ballantyne overall we were very satisfied with every service we received we were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival i personally had leigh for my facial and she was amazing she talked with me at length about my skin type the products that would work well and the experience was incredibly relaxing i have had facials before but this is the best one i've ever had my mom was equally satisfied with her service and said she could have stayed on the table forever i had choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure she was an expert and sought to ensure comfort at every step my mom and i had these together and it was a great experience - relaxing refreshing and lots of good chatter we had a beautiful view of the golf course and were sipping complimentary pomegranate martinis during these services i have not been doing a manipedi on a regular basis but am considering adding this on a monthly basis choyoung was very welcoming friendly and efficient the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout after gathering our things from the locker room we came back up to check out my mother went into the shop to browse while i waited to pay there was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk there was a woman behind the desk also not participating in the discussion but seemed like she was politely listening she clearly saw us walk up and my mother go into the shop i stood there for a bit expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member she would respond but did not i almost said 'excuse me' but given i do customer service for a living as well i wanted to see how long she would ignore me i continued to stand there and finally she (lindsey) greeted me i must say she was the most cold and rude person i encountered at the spa she presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with $700 in services and a forced 20% gratuity (i normally tip 20% and would have anyway but it's nice for the customer to have that choice) and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts it was almost as if i was a bother to her after i received my receipt i started to walk into the shop and i heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude after the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day it was not something i expected at the end it goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business additionally i sent this feedback in e-mail to the spa and heard absolutely nothing from themnot even a 'sorry'
0,crowded loud and not a relaxing experience stayed at the hotel and booked two massages was looking forward to a tranquil  environment sadly that did not happen the service was below par and did not measure up to the quality of the hotel i was not told about the facilities available it was loud crowded i was told i could relax after massage with my husband that did not happen and checking in was not smooth sadly not worth the money or time
0,made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 61414 to have a relaxing day but they gave me a stressful week it was a really nice place i was planning to go again but not anymorei was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was  different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too i think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization i received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes
0,overpriced threading maybe i'm spoiled by my shabby little nailsthreading place in new york but modern-phillips place charged me $70+ for what would be $30-40 in ny (compare business rents) sodi threaded my face in no particular order so i ended up with strays it scared me to death the way she hopped between my sideburns and my brows--you can lose half a brow that way no consultation on the shaping mediocre brow shaping with rows of sticking out hairs along the curve she did that way too rapidly with tweezers (so i guess she can't really do the fine work of threading a brow) the edge of a properly shaped brow should be perfectly sharp but also natural as if it grew that way holes should appear to be filled in magically my brows also now sit a bit unevenly on my face she wears a magnifier and this may give her a peephole view that is inadequate to perceive the overall shape but it should have allowed her to create a totally smooth edge and no straysno pre-sanitation or post-care of the skina mark where she caught my skin in her threadplus cold rude staff
0,pedicure should have been way better than it was if you're short you'll have to be uncomfortable because the seat doesn't adjust skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure
0,waited a few months to review because my experience was so bad i am hoping things have changed by now i booked my appointment with a third level 'color specialist' to darken my hair a bit light brown to a solid auburn after ratting my hair in a knot and then trying to brush it out more like ripping and telling me "pain is beauty" numerous times my hair turned out 2 different shades the top half being orange and the bottom being orange red when asked what i thought i pointed out the two different shades and how orange my hair was i was told he would put something else on it to even it out second time around still really brassy and two shades third time i said just to go dark brown because we weren't getting it right and i had been there for 3 hours already i get my hair done every 8 to 12 weeks and have never had an experience like this the hairdresser was so focused on his personal issues which i heard about that i don't think he was paying attention to what he was doing safe to say i was really upset and disappointed when i left the rest of the staff seemed really nice and the place was pretty and clean maybe i just caught the hairdresser on a bad day
0,got my hair cut here about a month ago during the shampooing my scalp began to feel a little tingly but no biggie by the time i sat in the stylist's chair though it felt as if my scalp was on fire my ears were bright red and anywhere else that the wet hair had touched my face turned the skin bright red clearly i was having a bad reaction to their aveda-only products  the stylist got very concerned and appropriately brought over the salon manager the clearly unconcerned heard-it-before manager said that she too had a bad reaction to their products as did some other customers and that i "might want to take a benadryl" when i got home  end of story not "how can we make it better for you" not "oh i am so sorry this happened" take a benedryl that and they charged me full price for my miserable experience - maybe they felt that they had to recoup the cost of rinsing my head againany service professional that doesn't understand the importance of customer service will not get my money again
0,went in for a simple everyday ordinary haircut two hundred seventy three (that's $27300) later i came home with products i just had-to-have pushed on me like drug dealers by everyone from the stylist the shampoo girl the facial girl the counter girls who just wouldn't take "no" for an answer and are very well-trained to "put you on the spot" in front of other customers so as to embarrass you and "trick" you into buying something you really don't need just to boost their commission sales jennifer hasn't the foggiest notion how to properly complete a man's haircut she neglected to trim the sideburns ear nose eyebrow and neck hair even though i asked her to which she responded "we have people who do that" (for an extra charge) and suggested i spend more money to have another girl wax these areas wtf are you kidding me here really on the lighter note i am getting a so-called complimentary facial definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more money
0,pedicure ever the polish bubbled and never cured properly besides making a mess of the job the stylist lathered on a lot of artificial flattery and tried to pressure me to buy a bunch of unnecessary over-priced random products  but all that i needed when i left this place was a new pedicure--which i gave to myself with some drugstore polish  never ever again will i go here  absolutely horrible experience
0,trying to unsubscribe from their mailing list though today they sent me 7 spam emails  stop it they also have a link to review their spa's on yelp on the e-mail - though it just goes to the yelp homepage they obviously don't care much about their customers  it was so long ago i was there i can't remember the service
0,came to snail motorsports with the intent to have 2 strollers powder coated and media blasted but unfortunately i ended up having to ask for a refund and not have them do any work i was really upset by the whole situation because i was really looking forward to having some custom powder coating done by someone who has done numerous amount of work for my friends juan the powder coater has done frames and rims for several friends so when i started asking around for who to take my items to everyone referred me to snail motorsportswhen i took my items to snail motorsports i was first quoted $37000 to media blast 18 items and custom powder coat 6 items i thought that was a little high so they reworked the numbers and came back with $240 i still thought that was a little high but i agreed to have it done and i payed half up front and left the items as i pondered about everything throughout the day i decided to look over the receipt and do some math i noticed that for a simple powder coat i was been charged $5 per item for a candy powder coat i was been charged $15 and for media blasting i was been charged $10 i then though to myself what if i got everything powder coated and some number crunching late it would roughly be $260 to powder coat everything could this be a $20 difference to have everything done i called snail motorsports and explained to them what i had came up with and i asked if the price to powder coat all my pieces would be $260 i was shocked when the answer came about the price to powder coat 2 strollers would be $60000 what i was so shocked with that sticker prices that i just sent an email and asked for them to not do any work and that i would pick up my itemsthere is no way 2 strollers would cost $60000 to powder coat its not 2 cars when i showed up the next day i was greeted by juan's wife who quickly offered me back my parts but also offered to get me another quote she came back with $48000 while there was no explanation to why we would go from $240 to $480 if the pricing per item remained the same i just could not do business with someone who was so inconsistent in their pricing i ended up calling several friends to find out if they have had similar experiences come to find out several friends explained how before juan use to be someone who you could talk to and ask questions too now he is either just too good for people or he just doesn't have the time for them that really sucks since some of my friends ended up telling me that they are sending stuff out of town to get done instead of having to deal with someone who has an ego
0,will never go back to this place again because their customer service was really very poor espescially the lady who always therei will never recommend this to anyone it was a bad experience of being here
0,bought a new set of wheels and took them to snail motorsports to be powdercoated when i picked them up they were nicely shrunk wrapped and put back in the boxes  the next day i took them down to the tire store to have them mount tires on them but after i got home i realized that there were mounds on one side of each of the spokes where the powder was sprayed too heavy i have had several people tell me how horrible they look which makes me really angry after paying to have these "professionally" powdercoated  there is nothing worse than bragging to your friends how nice the wheels are going to be just to have them laugh when they see how bad they look  now i have to get a second set of wheels to use while i pay to have the tires unmounted and have someone that knows what they are doing strip them back down and re-coat them
0,was my second visit and alas my last our first visit was at lunch and it was just ok we weren't blown away nor were we impressed but i will always opt to support a local mom & pop shop if all things are equal this last visit was the pitsit was 5:30pm on a saturday night we were one of two tables this is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun) appetizer was edamame it was overcooked and left uneaten i am not the adventurous sushi order-er; i had california rolls and spicy tuna the tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying as for my ca rolls the avocado was all brown not just the parts on the top (because i checked) all the way through when i brought it to the staff's attention her response was "oh yea avocado is like banana they get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday" what they did bring me another batch (that was part brown part green) but it was too late this was my first sushi restaurant ever that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten since we were all still hungry my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts yuck filthy not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever when i set it back is when i noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down needless to say we skipped dessert our first visit deserved a 25 but this visit was a 1
0, it's just rolls off the tongue doesn't it  no unfortunately notatallanymore  from hence forth all mentions of benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart  i hate complaining like this i really do but sometimes you just have to ya knowtuesday evening i met a group of friends for a birthday dinner  the reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm  all but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00 but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated  fortunately the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm  it was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders  she (name withheld because i don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders  as i was waiting i looked over at the table next to us who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday  at one point the mother (i'm assuming) smiled at me and said "i hope you get out before midnight we've been here over two hours  we're taking our cake and getting out of here"upon taking our orders one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill etc)  our server said that she would have to ask the manager who came to our table shortly thereafter  when the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave  i'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table not the restaurant but i'm not certain of this following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side  i asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables  i understand his point but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm  finally he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen  i'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option but i'll leave it at that  our chef tom eventually arrived at our table he was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation  during his time at the table my emperor's salad was delivered as were the majority of my table's sushi orders  however two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time  in fact they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals  at one point they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned who responded that they were "waiting for the rice"  when she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay  two hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at benihana we left  from start to finish the entire evening was a terrible experience  it was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom  were it not for the kindness and professionalism of tom (and the awesome company of friends) the night would have been a complete waste  my final thought is this the food was fine but because i was feeling particularly piggish on this tuesday evening i enjoyed two california rolls from my stash of costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant the difference between costco's rolls and benihana'sa toss up - just sayin  the good news is this will give my friends something to whine about for years to come
0,great memories and great experience at benihana but last night was not horrible service took 15 mins to even take a drink orderthen when i had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal could he go find no told me to go the bar and ask the bartender really then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini where's the veggies from start to finish it was about half an hour if we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold so we ate as we went also drink refills were a tough task too the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist few and far between we had 3 birthdays at our table not one song  which i didn't care not one complimentary picture no dessert was offered until another customer said something then the bill oh the bill that took another 15 mins at this point i told my family to go ahead home and i will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal i was double charged on two items at this point i was done dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating rectified the errors and was generous with a $20 refund i told him about the experience and all he said was "i can take picture now for you" um i was by myself no thanks one last thing the male greeter needs some drug intervention he was high as a kite and made my daughter & i feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post wow & boo and sad : (
0,is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at the food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled) hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char which none of our food had i question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu) not only was the food bad but the service was terrible our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces he acted confused when i asked for them additionally we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand this restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other i've eaten at
0,place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago  i recamen go sime where els n eat
0,is the worst hibachi i have ever had  we came here for a friends birthday and i will never be going back service was mediocre but the food was the real travestyyou go to hibachi for a show but it's not fun when the cook makes the same giant eagle joke the entire time  he also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from hibachi chefs  the food not good  my boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle  he didn't bother to have the guy heat it more bc it would have just been a hassle  the chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server  then after everything was cooked he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp i replied "no you never served me any" (i had ordered the chicken and shrimp)  he then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more by the time they were cooked everyone was finished eating  come on  to make matters worse when we left we saw that he was the head chef that doesn't say too much for the rest of them i don't know how people keep coming here  there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh for a lot less money  i mean honestly i paid $950 for a glass of kendall jackson no the best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought  do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different hibachi place  benihana is not worth your time or money
0,family and i have been going to benihana for about 5 years now we've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated even when we've had reservations in the past its been forgivable mostly because its close to home for us the food is okay (albeit a little pricey) and my grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi but that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday i made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner when i called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening our reservations were for 7:30 we arrive a little early at 7:20 and i let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in then we basically just wait and wait and wait we notice the hostess turning people away and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads by now its nearly 8 o'clock then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long by this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes my sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working but there are seven tables seated all waiting for fooddrinks so i ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated she informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick it would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders this is totally unacceptable first of all the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait or the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule either way we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat on an evening when we had reservations we decided to call ichiban to see if they could accommodate us they told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately as we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food it was now about 8:20pm our first dinner at ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at benihana so i don't think we'll ever be going back there i think ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice
0,sorry but as cool as andy is i just don't like the sushi  the tuna tasted metallic and mealy definitely not fresh  i actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite  the portions are large yes and the prices are good but i'd rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect
0,do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible that pissed me right off second the rolls here are sloppy not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite) but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go after my experience with the toro i don't think i will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try while the rolls are large the prices were quite steep not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood
0,ew gross i know that's not the most mature thing to say but that's what comes to mind when i think about this place sad thing is i've been here a couple times every time i kept thinking it would somehow get better but no it doesn't the miso soup they serve has this weird after taste and to be honest doesn't taste like any miso soup i've ever had so on to the sushi oh yeah it's gross too i think i kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous the thing is the fish does not taste fresh at all it's always luke warm andjustnotgood oh well i tried but i'd suggest you not
0,the worst sushi my husband and i have ever had  it was gross i don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold  you couldn't pay me to go back to this place
0,you're in the mood for fresh tasty sushi this is not the place for you the food that was delivered to us was simply inedible point blank my husband and i ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day so we splurged a little spent like $60 on various rolls the presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger meaning it's the msg-soaked kind; glue-like rice where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell when we took the lid off the tray the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back i honestly gaggedit was so awful we just stared at each other amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot determined to not waste everything i picked up a piece of spider roll to sniffinspecttry it had a huge hair in it all wound around the crab totally disgusting my husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice right it tasted like rotten fish as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls we had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup and a green salad with ginger dressing can't even believe this but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends they actually screwed up a green salad the soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot all metallic and burnt-flavored horrible horrible horrible we literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal total wastewe tried to call and complain but by the time our order was delivered the place was closed we will be calling again today to get our money back maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money
0,bother with the sushi can't speak to the korean bbqlong story short: i ordered delivery never had sushi delivered before so maybe this is just the way it goes but it took almost two hours to get to me there was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree i'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag assuming that the rolls were made long before i got them i just threw out the tuna roll which was warmer than room temp anyway vegetable roll was good but not exceptional fried rice wasjust not what i expected not exceptional either in short i paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice maybe this is better when you dine in still would not recommend pricey and doesn't live up to it at all
0,korean and my kids and i visit all the korean restaurants when we are out of town  since my daughter goes to pitt we wanted to treat our daughter to korean food  my family including my wife who is non- korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage   was the worst i have ever had  their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat  will not go back
0,am sorry to say that this place still stinks  i work in the strip and often get temped by sushi kim  i stopped in for lunch today and i was the only person in the whole place  that should have tipped me off  the last time i was there i had a bad meal but i wanted to give them another shot  i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu  i believe is was l1numbered menu itemsanother tip   my food was terrible  the miso soup was horrid and old the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved  avoid this place at all costs
0,this place based on reviews in local paper and friends this place was awful we asked questions of the server and ordered based on them neither was goody friend said she cannot eat real spicy food and asked them to tone it down her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it  mine was just disappointing the only thing i found good was the plain rice i also thought it was extremely over priced will not return
0,from the west coast this is probably the worst sushi i have had in a very long time there are no descriptions for any of the rolls they do not offer low sodium soy sauce the wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes now for the food the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops i wouldn't know) actually everything i ate was mushy the service was inattentive i waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass
0,mignon not as advertisedwe ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi  the flavor was ok we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet  false advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegalthe fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles  other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice togetherthe miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful  the salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizingwe also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best i have experiencedthe waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea  the whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $7500 tip included  not worth the price time gas and wear and tear on the car to get there
0,& time of visit:  may 21 dinnertimei don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar eight-course tasting menu  that menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste after the first two (2) courses were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side  moreover the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants  as for their restroom only one and a unisex one at that  and yes there was urine on the floor
0,used to be our favorite place when we first moved to pittsburgh two years ago  it had good quality fish and a nice atmospherecool staff  as of our last visit about two months ago the menu still had not changed the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same and the atmosphere was on par with that of a hofbrauhaus  a drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other  it literally looked like there was going to be a brawl  the members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened  no one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into  it was absolutely not the experience we expected to have and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill
0,$1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced
0,don't go here i'm begging you i wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy i wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend this place was a literal nightmare i think i've been to jimmy wan's 4 times this month so i was sick of it plus i'd heard good things about taipei so i thought i'd give it a whirlthe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize i'd sat down he was very kind but only dropped my food off no "how's it going" no water refills no offer of dessert or other courses a kind busboy kept refilling my drink the portions are extremely small - i've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life the menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white huh jimmy wan's offers white and brown no extra charge interestingthe atmosphere was atrocious  a family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7 mind you) take off his shoes and walk around he then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between he swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet i audibly gasped but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me then she threatened to take each of their kindles away if they didn't shut up the boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night longthe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all my waiter didn't show up after i was finished with my meal and when he did (after i'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates i finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if i wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy youthink i want something to go how were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order howis that busyother reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands if you care about your health don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet if they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen i have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cookingjews don't go here on christmas even if though they loudly advertise they're open if 15 people means they're "busy" can you imagine what it'll be like on christmasthe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding i dropped my little brother off at jimmy wan's immediately before going to taipei - a 15 second drive between establishments wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends he called me to pick him up as i was paying the bill how the hell did taipei take as long as jimmy wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me the 15th person in their restaurantonly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist
0,used to frequent tai pei once a week or so but within the last few years it has gone severely downhill the food is greasy way too expensive and they use massive amounts of msg i got terrible msg poisoning from tai pei and ever since then have gone to jimmy wan's down the road
0,visited with a groupon last thursday we ordered the hot and sour seafood soup the black bean chicken szechuan beef and lamb with scallions the soup was awesome very spicythe rest of the food was awful it was tasteless the meat had a weird fluffy texture there was zero flavor it was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager he said the kitchen would make new dishes they brought three new entrees they were again completely flavorless but warmer i couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat it was awful we paid and left yuck i used to go here as a child i remember the sushi was always good maybe that is the thing to order
0,into cosmos last night for dinner before the michael buble concert  it was a nightmare  first and foremost they were serving a limited special event menu  not a huge deal except the concept of a limited menu is to reduce the variety of entrees being prepped so you can get meals out of the kitchen faster when the place is packed  four diners at my table and all three entrees and my salad (more on that shortly) arrived at different times with the last one arriving 10 minutes after the first  and brought to the table without apology  so why did i order a salad  becuase i wanted an entree with chicken as the protein and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (i am not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya)  i also didn't appreciate that they served olives with the pits in a salada recipe for cracked or chipped dental work  lastly our waiter forgot our drinks and bread after several requests  and then messed up our bills (yes we split checksshame on us)  if you are going to go through the trouble of doing a special event menu to accomodate a crowd then round out the preparations by staffing appropriately (in the kitchen and the dining room)
0,at cosmos on a thursday bogo on tapas ordered chicken quesadilla n needed more sour cream n was charged 50 cent ridiculous i will never patronize again also the food is just ok not the greatest they should b glad u stop in with all the other choices
0,went here with a social group for drinksmeal on a thursday evening we had the upstairs reserved just for us the atmosphere was comfortable the downstairs [outside of our group] was dead the physical layout of this place is impressive on the outside it looks like a corner business but its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area anyways back to the actual experience they served food upstairs for our group which was cool but you had to put your credit card down as a tab [not an issue] the bar selection is ok the food was ok the issue i have with this place is that when you go to pay out they give you a post swiped transaction this is the receipt that shows the total card transaction details tip and total they did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service after requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it i paid and put down a tip after looking at the receipt later it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt i find this to be very deceptive and fraudulent adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me it bothers me when 1 it was never stated that would be there 2 when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group i was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] to add insult to injury they try to play the club vibe outside they put up velvet ropes and use a door man there was no line and secondly giving an impression of an "exclusive club" is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs vibe: deadfood: decentdrinks: typical selectiondrink price: $5 for a beer [mid range for downtown]would i go here again no absolutely noti've been to the ballantyne location twice and i can't say that's a bad place
0,limited options in uptown i gave this place a few chances  it's just not good  i got some eel that wasn't fresh and i haven't been able to eat eel since  i also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in
0,the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that i have left before getting my food me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon that we had purchased specifically for fujo they refused to take it and the manager told us "you have two choices ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it" if we had been rude then i wouldn't be able to blame him but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it we walked out and went to emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food
0,was absolutely terrible  it was so highly reviewed but absolutely terrible  not that we ate the food because we never had a chance  we were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server  there were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks  still waiting on our drinks our appetizer came out with no silverware no plates still no drinks  our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once)  shortly thereafter he brought the drinks still no plates and no silverware  we waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads  still no plates and no silverware  when we asked again about the plates he laughed as though we had made some strange request  we continued to wait - no chopsticks no silverware no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  it's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service  the food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight i'm glad that we had no utensils  if you have an hour to kill are looking for terrible service aren't in a rush and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise stay away
0,food ain't bad  but their predatory towing practices arei parked in front of a sign that said customer parking only  i was a customer and my car got towedthe owners of the business say its not their problem its the owner of the parking lot  the owner of the parking lot says its not his problem eitherso my $30 meal just got a $120 tax added on to it
0,ordered take out of tom yum soup and chilli chicken what a disappointment none of these tasted good tom yum soup was kinda disgusting
0,have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors however i was very disappointed for their lack of "respect" to what a customer orders  i order my usual the mee goreng with tofu and as i combed through and had a couple of bites i found a strip of chicken  i lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish  this place is black listed for me and i hope to find a better malaysian place in the queen city
0,review is about the food only i'm in town and without a vehicle so naturally i was looking up some tasty delivery options on yelp when i came across cuisine malaya i was elated to see that they delivered  i got my food fast both dishes came in very nice containers and i was sure i was in for a real treat based on other reviewers i had the steamed popiah  and the beef char kway teowback to the opening of the containers first the steamed popiah i'll admit i have never had popiah before and they probably would have been better if they were fried   the popiah consisted of a thick roll stuffed with mostly rice and some other ingredients it was topped and garnished very nicely the problem is it didn't taste like anything  i'm a firm believer in not eating tasteless food   the char kway teow was similar in appearance to pad see ewe but again this dish was tasteless i mean i couldn't taste any flavors how does this even happen did they forget to add flavor to my meal  i ended up only eating a tiny amount of my food  it's so sad when you have something that looks delicious but turns out to be a barrel of bland
0,make sure to scrutinize a resturant review from a college studentit's more than likely based on the cost of beers rather than food quality my sushi was warm food was cold and the chicken in my stir fry tasted old
0,boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for a long time the food was great and the service was great everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position the food quantity and quality started to go down hill there was hair in my food not once but twice every time i order a rice dish the new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended i even brought it up the sushi is very plain and not high quality either as a college student they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable we will not be coming back at all there are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction
0,booked her for my daughter's party and she double-booked herself now i know the reason she asks you to call and confirm the day before your party then she made it seem as if i misunderstood her when our entire "booking" conversation was well documented by text messages i don't think there is a way for me to misunderstand the words "my other client fell through i'm available for your party" luckily the lady she pawned me off on ended up being available and amazing look elsewhereupdate 52812: i was going to leave my review as what it is - the truth but now after receiving an email from this "business" owner asking me to change my review and now accusing me of sending someone i don't even know to rate her badly i had to update and confirm that i absolutely stand by my 1st review the owner sent me an email a few months back asking me to give her a better review because her life was busy w work and school or something (i already deleted email) it was more of a "poor me" email than an apology i thoughtyou know what i'm not even replying to this because i'm a mother full-time student and have a full-time day job and i make it work no excuses plus her follow-up comment makes it seem like she knew she was over-booked but planned to send me to another face-painterthat couldn't have been the case because when i called to "confirm" her presence at my party she had no clue who i even was i had to explain every little detail of when we talked and who i was before she gave me a  to another face-painter hoping (not knowing) whether this other person would be booked or not so don't act like you had it all planned out and under control  after skimming through her other reviews this morning i see that now she thinks that any bad review must be from me or one of my minions let me say i have absolutely no idea who the other 1-star commenter is i am connected as a friend on yelp with everyone i do know and its sad that i have to defend that fact  if you look at any of my other reviews you will see i gave out 4 or 5 stars for every other company and that is because they deserved it bottom line a business is a business you aren't the only person trying to make it through this hectic life in one piece run your business well in the future and stop harassing me about my honest reviews
0,is completely unprofessional first i take i contact her to do face painting for my daughter's birthday party it takes her 3 days to get back to me then during trying to nail down a time for her to come out she over books herself it's clear she isn't a true professional nor is she proactive about her business i will not be using her and you may want to look else where
0,came in and the visit started ok the lady at the front desk told me to pick a color and have a seat for my pedicure when i went back i was waiting for 20 minutes maybe they forgot about me i finally asked one of the ladies how long i would wait and one looked at me and asked if i was in a rush really one of the girls working there came back to sit in one of the recliners and one of the nail techs sat down to start her pedicure until i asked again how long will i be here then she realized that she probably should do my pedicure insteadi couldn't believe that and then the other ladies (other nail techs) looked at my funny because i as the customer was expecting to get service before an employee i was in a rush employee was not i won't be coming back here how rude
0,asked for the manager and the manager wasn't there  the person that replied wasn't even there to comment on this situation and of course would say anything to make themselves look good and there were no other customers in front of me i know for sure the lady that almost got serviced before me worked there  i am not going back another visit
0,several years i was an occasional client of cobblestone until my last experience i do not plan on returning againi made an appointment for a manicure on halloween at 630pm i was going to a family wedding the next day in texas and i really wanted to get my nails done before i left when i called to make the appointment i asked if they'd still be open that late considering that it was halloween the girl on the phone said yes and i made the appointment i arrived at cobblestone at 620pm the whole place was empty and dark but i could see someone still in the building i went inside and spoke to eileen who told me they were closed i let her know i made an appointment and she went to check her book she found my name but still said that they were closed she said that she wanted to call me earlier that day to let me know they were closing early due to halloween but her receptionist didn't get my phone numberi left the spa very unhappy and the next day i went to the wedding in texas without having my nails done upon my return to tempe i went back to cobblestone i spoke to eileen again and expressed my displeasure she apologized and asked me if i wanted to get my nails done that day i said yes and she took me back for a manicure and pedicure right away eileen did a great job like always and my nails looked very goodafter my nails were finished i went up to the front to pay and she only charged me for the manicure giving me the pedicure for free she apologized again for what had happened the previous week i appreciate the free pedicure but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth truthfully i do not feel like a valued client the salon is nice and generally they do a great job but i will not be returning
0,was so excited to get my hair cut & colored because of the great reviews on here i wish i could be one of the very happy customers but unfortunately i am not hair cut it was okay she seemed like she was in a hurry & for the price i should have gone somewhere else color the dye that is actually on my hair looks nice but the dye is also all over my face my forehead my neck i can understand a bit on my forehead but why are there streaks of dye on my cheek on my eyelid when felice (the owner) was dying my hair the dye was flying everywhere i give two stars because the place was easy to find & felice seemed like a nice lady also they offer other services there &i a lot of products but i will not be going backedited to one star because i found a ton of dye in my ear & now i am pissed off i could have done a better job then she did
0,sure if they are closed for business but none of my calls were returned when i left a few vm's will update this if they ever do call back
0,here for eyelash extensions and they were absolutely horrifying there was so much glue it ruined my own eyelashes they literally started falling off before i even got home i looked like a clown i was hysterical my husband went back down there and spoke with them eyelashes in hand and they refused to refund the money paidshe would reapply them i have no lashes to attach them too do not do business here they don't care about a happy customer they care about the money
0,nail technician was susan  i showed her a picture of exactly what i wanted (short french tips with rounded corners)  she began the process and right off the bat was very rough with the manual and electric buffers especially on my cuticles  i have not had a manicure in 12 years so i couldn't remember if they were supposed to trim your cuticles or not or whether the process was supposed to be painful or not which it most definitely was  after some research i now know they should not cut your cuticles because if they nick and cause an open would with their un-sanitized instruments you could get an infection and a potentially nasty one at that (think staph mrsa etc)  and she did cut mine open on the side of two fingers my middle and thumb to the point they bled a little  and apparently you should not see any existing white powder on the buffers they use on you meaning they have not been cleaned or swapped out after each client  the buffers she used on me (manual and electric) had a considerable amount of existing white nail powder on themthe charge was $30 and i gave her a $5 tip which i now know i shouldn't have and i really regretmy nails did not turn out looking like the picture i showed susan  she applied the tips too far in making my nail beds look short and stubby  the rounded corners i asked for turned into rounded sides with sharp corners looking very odd  and there are visible air bubbles trapped under each nail's polishi can deal with the way my nails look but the thing i am most upset about are the two cuticles she cut and made bleed  i washed them really well and used disinfectant on them  it is now the next day and the wounded areas are puffy and red so yes they are infected  i can only hope and pray it won't be serious and will clear up quickly  i will be soaking them in listerine today  if the infections persist i will be reporting this saloni cannot speak for the other technicians who work there but if you must go there do not use susan
0,got eyelash extensions yesterday  i have had them for two years from another salon in chandler but thought i would try this place after a friend recommended it  i found holly to be pushy about the pricing at first telling me $100  she did my eyelashes in 30 minutes and it looked like a 30 min job  the entire time she did my eyelashes she was fighting with a friend who was standing there next to me accusing her of flirting with an ex of hers   can you say "unprofessional"     i am going in to my previous salon as quick as possible to get them removed because they looked like cheap spiders on top of my eyes
0,lash techdoesn't  know what she was doing didn't have me sign a liability waiverwhich as a certified lash technician it is against the law to put chemicals near people's eyes without first signing a liability waiver  eyes were puffy and red the next day she added for lashes to a single lash which if you've ever had your lashes done you know that's very painful i called her and complained she told me to come in the next day that she would give me my money back when i came in the next day she was not there and is now refusing to give me my money backdo not use her for lashes
0,did my top and bottom eyeliner in july she never mentioned how dialated my pupils would be very unsafe to drive she argued with me very arrogantly when i questioned her use of scented generic baby wipes to scrub my eyes (open wounds at that point)next day my eyes were swollen shut then were red and oozed pus for 3 days the top liner did not stay at all it came completely off when we asked for partial money back or for her to fix in some way you want talk about rude and unprofessional she did not show kindness or offer to make it right in any way i've never seen anything like her in my life
0,find i can no longer be a customer at salon christine christine's conductattitude toward me regarding my valid question about aveda products possibly reverting back to animal testing was rude unprofessional and insulting not only did she not respond to my facebook question on her salon's page but only after an email to her did she reply with a curt answer and to add insult to injury she's banned me from further postingcommenting on the salon's facebook page i didn't realize an inquiry regarding a product for which i'm paying wasn't permitted instead of setting the record straight (which should've been done) she elected to ignore my question delete it from facebook and then ban me from the salon's page wow that said i'll really miss katie as she's a great hairstylist and colorist
0,purchased a gift certificate up front from them only to find out that they were never going to let me use it    i kept calling to try to make appointments and each time i called the staff was rude and said that they had no appointments    my gift certificate expired because they never had any appointments available (or so they said) and when i explained my situation to them over the phone they were extremely rude    i said that i would tell my friends and family about my awful experience there and about how they took my money but never provided services to me    the staff said something extremely rude to me over the phone and then hung upi will never give this salon my money again     it's a shame that i'm out 50 bucks and have nothing to show for it     i was scammed
0,so my big beef here is not so much with this location of bath and body works but rather with bath and body works as a company in general let me explain for starters i just want to say that this store is clean well-presented and has some very nice girls working in it the scents of candles and lotions are incredible and they were hard to resist with their fall displays front and center with names like "autumn leaves" and "cinnamon pumpkin" their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice (sigh)so here's why i'll never shop here again i came in to check out the store and in my browsing around grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try i always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before i commit to purchasing i put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on so i left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating i don't even remember which scent it was but that's not important anyway an hour and a half later i was back in the store and heading for the counter bottle in hand so i'm reading the back i'm trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases especially beauty products in that i only buy products that are paraben-free and not tested on animals call me uptight but i just don't think animals should be tortured so i can smell like fake juniper i scan the label and see that it does contain parabens but it smells so friggin good i make an exception then i see it: "this finished product not tested on animals" and for a minute i think great ready to buy and thenthis"finished" product  what the heck does that mean normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say "not tested on animals" or "we never test our products on animals" or the like and if it says nothing you always assume that they do test on animals but "this finished product" so the final product that fills the bottle in my hand the one that i intend to use has not been tested on any animal but what about everything before that and then i just got mad very mad do they think we are idiots some big shot at bbw must believe that their customers are totally mindless lazy and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose i don't know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don't run the tests either way out of principle i put the bottle back and decided i will never again give a dime of my money to bbw excuse the rant but this just really pissed me off
0,has become a travesty of retail during my most recent visit for a pack of gum and a bottle of water i waited in line for nearly 10-minutes and watched two cashiers swap registers no fewer than 4 times and i have no idea why the gentleman with his wife in front of me said "this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen at a store ever" and i couldn't have agreed morewhen it came time for me to check-out my total came to $316 and i was asked if i was a member of their rewards club followed by "why not" followed by "why not join it's free" when i declined and opted to pay in cash the guy took my $4 and then didn't give me any change he wished me "well" and when i asked for my change he looked at me like i was crazy i reminded him that i paid $4 for a $316 item he then said "oh did you want your change"ugh
0,anti-hybrid of fogies stuck in their ways of business and young kids that don't give a shit as soon as you walk in to the store you are bombarded with stink that stench comes from the overbearing sprayers that take guerrilla tactics and stink bomb you from counter angles you have no clue what wretched stank is coming from where after you run (jog hell no) from smell factor you are greeted with overpriced products everywhere you turn there have brands that have not been promoted since the 80's at like $70+ for a shirt insane i wonder why they have had financial issues for decadesthe service is so annoying you can tell they are told to rush customers those that are older take it to heart and do so with parody-worthy vigor the younger clerks are indifferent; you could read the "don't bother me and let me text my bff because they pay me minimum wage anyway" expression the potpourri of intolerables beckons a new chapter in the fear and loathing series

0,clothing selection rude lady working in the shoe department actually looked at me with surprise when i greeted her (she hadn't acknowledged me even after making eye contact so i said "hi how are you")  i was hoping to buy a new pair of boots not so much after getting treated so gruffly by the shoe sales person the lady stared at me with surprise like i interrupted her thoughts about tonight's meatloaf dinner after a few seconds she replied in a muffled grunt "uhhi" (what's that about)i left wondering what kind of 1980s throwback time machine this place must be unorganized dated clothing odd smell very disappointed
0,have a gift certificate for an ultimate makeover - 2 12 hours of consultation cut color style and makeup  i was really excited to try the spa and in desperate need of a haircut so i called right away to make an appointment i was lucky enough that the first available appointment although 2 weeks away was on a friday night  i booked the appointment and made big plans to go out with friends to debut my new look (really how often do you get to have your makeup professionally done for a night out) flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment i received a voicemail message informing me that mallory was running behind with another appointment and i would need to call to reschedule mine  wtf you're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter servicei swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience  nope  i was informed that mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or i could see someone else on a tuesday - who needs their makeup done for a tuesday nighthonestly if it wasn't a gift certificate i would just cancel and go somewhere else this is not a great first impressionto be fair i would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful so that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star  i will update after i have my service hopefully they are worth the inconvenience and irritation

0,went in for a simple everyday ordinary haircut two hundred seventy three (that's $27300) later i came home with products i just had-to-have pushed on me like drug dealers by everyone from the stylist the shampoo girl the facial girl the counter girls who just wouldn't take "no" for an answer and are very well-trained to "put you on the spot" in front of other customers so as to embarrass you and "trick" you into buying something you really don't need just to boost their commission sales jennifer hasn't the foggiest notion how to properly complete a man's haircut she neglected to trim the sideburns ear nose eyebrow and neck hair even though i asked her to which she responded "we have people who do that" (for an extra charge) and suggested i spend more money to have another girl wax these areas wtf are you kidding me here really on the lighter note i am getting a so-called complimentary facial definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more money
0,pedicure ever the polish bubbled and never cured properly besides making a mess of the job the stylist lathered on a lot of artificial flattery and tried to pressure me to buy a bunch of unnecessary over-priced random products  but all that i needed when i left this place was a new pedicure--which i gave to myself with some drugstore polish  never ever again will i go here  absolutely horrible experience
0,now understand where the name comes from yesterday i went into dick's to buy my daughter some shirts as we were checking out i noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs i started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package it said things like " missing manual or dead battery" i found a watch that was missing a manual i went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for i purchased the watch as is and took it home after trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour i went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital i went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on i was told that i had to speak to nicole the store manager i was directed to nicole who was assisting another customer after standing patiently waiting for nicole while the customer and nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones i got annoyed i went back to the counter to find a different manager i was told that nicole is it i waited some more after waiting for nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me i explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in   i pointed out that as people look through the bag   watches are being mixed up i showed her timex watches with polar band and bags with two watches and no bands some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps after going through each bag i could not find the correct band someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band i asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference nicole said no i get "as is" but i purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual it did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and datenow i have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watchpissed of morrison family ymca soccer dad
0,been to several dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst a few years ago i took my mountain bike to them for a basic service upon picking it up i realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor i brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that i was wrong and they don't do that i asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff i asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either i took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologizedi since stopped frequenting them sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areai had to visit this location again recently i had a backpack on as i rode there in my motorcycle i walked in the store and started headed to the department i was needing i was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me i could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues i told her that i had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule i also informed her that there was no signage stating that as i walked in the store she continued to state that i could either give them my backpack or i could leave the storei told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as i did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in itthis brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant they are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetici wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area
0,poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurelsif you have breast cancer the last thing you need is poor service and pushy sales clerks i would give no stars if that were an option stay away
0,pushy i went with my mother who is fighting cancer  i was shocked at how pushy they were with her they are taking advantage of cancer patients
0,way would i ever go back i was looking to trade and was offered 40% of what i paid gun was brand new i then asked to see what they had in the price they offered me not much even in the used section  i told the guy that i was confused with the prices because i was looking at used guns with new gun prices he was very defensive and said they had overhead and it's has to be paid for somehow what a joke i've been to several other shops who are very friendly and have much better prices
0,overpriced save your money and go elsewhere not willing to deal  go to eagle guns instead
0,absolute worst food in vegas in my opinion  we got our food to go had the irish stew and it was nasty i was only able to take two bites before having to give up  extremely strong after taste left in the mouth even now an hour after taking those two bites never again will i visit this establishment for food or anything else for that matter  if i could give it 0 stars i would
0,fridays we go to mcmullins for oysters yesterday as usual we met another couple for happy hour  the server "jennifer" sucked  bad attitude we asked for separate checks ordered and was over charged for items she never cleared our table only when we got up to get rid of the plates that had been sitting for 30 minutes did the bus person take them away  when we got the bill it was one check not split as requested when we sat down  the server denied we had asked  more attitudewhat troubles me as much is everyone else still wanted to give her a 18% tip  why  for crap service   we support the establishment by spending our hard earned money  this server should be fired not getting a $2000 tip for attitude and crappy service
0,i have to give it one star  let me preface this review by saying that i did not eat here  i did not eat here because upon arrival the host (who wasn't at the stand when we came in but had to wait several minutes for him to appear) just walked up and said flatly "there's no room here we're full"  my mother sister and i (all well dressed and very presentable) stared at him in shock at his rudeness and he said "we have trivia tonight and there's a soccer game"  the place was indeed very full and we had come hoping to play the trivia (and were about 20 minutes early for trivia) but there are better ways to handle this such as merely being nice to potential customers  needless to say this was a total turnoff to ever try coming back to this place
0,went back to mcmullan's for their ayce fish and chips again and was super disappointedthe fish had a distinctly unappetizing ammonia-like smell my husband smelled it i smelled it and even our waitress smelled it after we pointed it out to hera second order was just as bad-smelling fish starts to smell like ammonia when it rots and decomposes mmm-mmm goodthe one star is for the irish nachos which were delicious (we split an order of those instead after the fish was taken off the bill)i won't be back
0,irish nachos were a bit bland  we came in to get an appetizer  meal and possibly desert  but once the waitress took our drink and appetizer order  she never took our meal order  i guess if you are not drinking bear or whiskey you can forget about service
0,a lot hope you love spicy foodwent here for wings and fish and chips the fish and chips are a whopping $15 but bizarre enough the wings only come in an extra hot saucewhyi left and didn't get either some people are physically unable to tolerate super spicy foodsget a clue guys
0,sure what everyone is rating  this place makes dotty's look upscale it's connected to a gas station  we were there this saturday at 10:30pm and place was tiny  a few regulars at the bar and no live music  place felt old and creepy  definitely not a place to take your date
0,i could give less then one star i would  horrible service  the waitress greeted us by  saying "what can i get you" there was no "hello" "welcome" or anything of the sort  epic fail  the place was very dimly lit which always makes me a little uneasy  i like to be able to see what is going on especially if i'm consuming food  there was trash on the floor and it just was not my cup of tea  needless to say we did not stay  will never return
0,from out of town for a trip to fabulous las vegas and am a huge soccer fan after buying the new  usa away jersey at the nike store at the forum shops the salesman highly hyped this place and for the usa vs turkey game a new destination was high on my list i may have not calculated the time zone change correctly but showed up an hour and a half early for the game wearing my new jersey an employee saw me and instead of offering me a place to sit or a drink to have while i waited i was greeted angrilyannoyingly by an employee who stated that "you know kickoff doesn't start until eleven" rude and disrespectful leaving i ended up watching the game at the sporting house instead so much for trying a new place
0,was ok waitress was horrible i get the feeling she really hates her job she was never around when we needed her because she was constantly busy gambling  on top of that she was unable to answer very basic questions about the menu next time we'll go to crown & anchor
0,ate here about 7 months ago and it was ok not greattonight i went in this place waited for 10 minutes at the hostess stand while no one attempted to even acknowledge me  a girl ran by and said "give me just one sec" and never came back  then this slob said "we'll be right with you" without even looking at us because he was cleaning bar tablesi will never go back to this place again unless hickory tavern fox and hound bww and every other sports bar pub and tavern in charlotte go out of business
0,are out of business
0,in soon after the conversion from molly malone's my wife and i had enjoyed eating there regularly as soon as we walked in the stench of smoke was so strong that we walked back out my actual rating is no stars since we did not do anything but walk in and out we were so disappointed that the 17%  of smokers were considered more important than the other 83% of non-smokers i thought maybe i was too harsh but two nights ago while dining at the lodge (which has a separate eating area from the bar) i overheard people in the next booth saying the same thing this place is now irrelevant for me maybe it will change but i'm not holding my breath although if i ever walk in there again i probably will have to
0,bartenders are friendly and the drink selection is creative such as the long island mr iced t  how cool is thatbut this place is a hellhole for people who really like to dance without getting blind wasted  there is no designated dance area and the place is fairly large so you end up with a bunch of people milling about beers in hand   i have never seen so many people so slovenly drunk bumping into you or spilling their drink on you  it's like dancing in a barn with all the animals running loose   it's probably the gothiest place in town and i really wanted to like it place but all three times i've been i spent more effort trying to control my violent tendencies than having fun dancingand the dj is overkill  three screens show movies and videos which is fine  but it gets really annoying with the dj calling out the names of every band and song perhaps he thinks you were too drunk to remember or too young to have lived it  we all know these songs by heart it's totally cliche and they're not teaching us anything new  the dj just likes being the center of attention which provides an abhorrent atmosphere  they also completely mash songs together sometimes running over the best parts of the end or even the middle of a song with the beginning of another  they do not watch the dance floor which is dj lesson 1  if a good thing is already happening on the dance floor don't mess it up  i heard three crashes in a row on the dance floor one night and the entire crowd just stops moving  it makes it a memorable night  but not in a good wayps: whatever happened to the "no bottles or glassware on the dance floor" rule  i guess they only enforce that at "classy" establishments
0,i haven't been in since my "experience" i really don't have a desire to go backthe night my friend and i decided to give it a whirl well we drove up and the parking lot was full of cadillacs and buicks should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked there was a very large foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door hmmm we walked up and he looked at us like what are these two white girls doing here we were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building (which was all of them) swung around to look at us it was seriously just like the old westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes we stood there for a hot second a guy started hitting on my friend so i pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of therei could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we lefthmm maybe we were there on the wrong night**for the record because i'm sure someone will get offended i am in no way racist and i would have loved to stay and party with everyone the only reason we left was because we felt entirely completely unwelcome
0,staff run down interior not the safest place in town
0,this place like they serve salmonellaour dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember  we sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show upi ordered what the waiter claimed was their "signature" dish paella latorre  it was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm  i called over the waiter and explained  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had "re-heated" it  while the plate was hot the food was still tepid  i called the waiter over again and told him  he argued that he "saw" the chef reheat the food  by this time my business associate had almost completed his meal so i ate as much as i could and left about 13we told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check  he returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do  we called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he would dothe following week i contacted blerim meta the general manager of this restaurant as well as "aquavina"  he has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experienceavoid this restaurant  avoid aquavina
0,c-street i was really looking forward to hearing alexander spin some spooky music last night i was there for a number of hours during his posted set times and heard nothing that i wouldn't expect to hear on top 40 radio alex kept saying he hoped to get back on the decks but it didn't happen while i was therei paid money to enter last night for one reason only i wanted to hear the music i enjoy i bought numerous drinks to support the bar i even bought some jello shots despite my better judgement i know how this is supposed to work i spent years working at gothindustrial clubs in the bay area a friend runs the longest continually operating gothindustrial club in the united states our community used to have a vibrant scene in town and i think it could again but not if venues bump 'our' night for frat parties and pull stunts like last night's
0,cover no hats and they steal your id  how is this garbage still in business
0,female best friend and i were in town for the night road-trippingit seemed like a nice place inside - totally empty but it was late and a weeknight so i didn't think much of it i didn't have much of a problem with drinks or service until later that night and that's why i'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star reviewthis is a review about a certain bartender whose name my friend and i never got but he said he was chinese and colombian the area seems to close down early even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out the bartender said he was closing up early directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby shortly after the same bartender showed up at the bar started drinking with us i don't remember much about the conversation except for some lies this guy was telling us saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there that he didn't live in phoenix he lived in new york - later he forgot that he said that and told us he lived in the same city in california that we did by the time the bar closed i was getting pretty sloshed and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (i thought my friend invited him and my friend thought i did) and by the time we got to my friend's car he insisted i sit in the back seat i'll skip some details here and make a long story short:i puked on the ride home so i spent the rest of the night sobering up the chinesecolombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian by the way) and when you're a man you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants it became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted and so i forced myself to stay awake again i'm skipping on a lot of detail here because yelp really isn't the place for thatafter he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place) my friend went to the bathroom and i mustered all the civility i had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible to this he insisted that unless i reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which i personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave i bit my tongueshortly after i could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette i snapped had to get rude with him pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face the point of this whole review is this:ladies watch out for this sleazeball bartender he'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means
0,place is a joke  the girls that were handling the cover wouldn't give me my money back from being in that place for only 1 min   they weren't apologetic at all on top of that no one was in there
0,staff was so rude 1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime fri night we came back about 20 min later different door guy and some old ladies who would not let us in said we had to each pay $10 the place was ghetto and empty we went back to bar smith (next door) who had much nicer staff no cover great drinks & drink prices and awesome music sorry sky lounge you suck
0,use your creditdebit cardbartenders will tip them self after you leave even if you already tip them with cash
0,place is horrid they are discriminatory and i will never come back they are also horribly organized fail
0,horrible place snakes was treated like pieces of shit and we will not stand for it the manager is a complete asshole and doesnt give a shit if you have a good time or not as long as he gets his money completely unprofessional and neither myself or any of my friends will ever set foot in this hell hole of a place ever again
0,words: overpriced and understaffedi'm not sure if palazzo is always open "sometimes" or just recently reopened but they've brought back the goth night one friday a month just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night just the establishment itself every time i have been the bar has been understaffed two for an entire nightclub that is packed how does that work it takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get there's also a back bar that seems to never be in use with the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night you'd think they'd hire a few extra people also maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people it's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment it's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks
0,is awesome bartenders real nice dj's suck we have patronized all the goth  bars in town for years and dj's are getting so bad with music i used to love this place now i don't think we will ever go back shame too because all other barsclubs are closed down we need a better scene and better dj's
0,place charges a cover charge we should be paid to come in there it's in a horrible place in town drinks or retardedly over priced & the parking is ridiculous the inside of the club only smells more worse then the urinal because the little tiny room they call a bathroom is 2x2 you can't pay me to come back there i wish i had known how horrible this place was before i got suckered into going & basically throwing away my money
0,far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me i know gay nightclubs lol no seriously this place is crap i have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and it's no fun the drag show is lame or the acts i have seen are the dj is good plays some different tunes the ac is non existent i think they use a swamp cooler the bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal the drinks are expensive watered down and even the soda tasted funny the bar tender was very nice and friendly never tried the food outside but i hear it's great the parking is another disaster there is limited space and the night we went there was a few break ins in the back parking lot near liquor store just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club give it a shot at your own risk but remember i warned you
0,very odd place will not be returning extremely loud forget having a conversation with anyone we were by the front door and this stage on the other end of the bar and still couldn't hear each other def a dive bar mostly men keep a close eye on your wife or girlfriend they'll be snatched if you're not careful lots of hog members and other motorcycle clubs present this crowd makes me somewhat nervous and my husband is a 250lb biker
0,went to the sunday night salsa lessons at paragon there were about 200 people for the salsa group lessons it was a noisy zoo men far outnumbered women but during the course of the lesson it almost evened out lot's of partner switching -- in fact switching is almost all we did that has it's advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners i have certainly heard a lot of hype about paragon but the studio left me kind of cold i don't see how anybody could learn to dance there the quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios i have been to of course maybe the instruction was better than i knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question i gave them another try on a thursday for a west coast swing lesson the quality of instruction wasn't good and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom they have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom i watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what i saw paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners so if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else for meat markets do paragon their prices and quality will appeal to anyone who thinks mcdonald's is a great deal
0,today i probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however today the service was terrible we waited two hours for a pizza sub french onion soup fries and buffalo chicken tenders about an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie no hot sauce) we were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it she sent it back by a half hour later we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders nor the french onion soup (which should have been mostly made already) and no fries  we were told the chef was new but no effort was made really to make the situation better no quick and easy app or beers on the house to boot the beer was pretty expensive i will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection but it won't be for a while the food has always been average at best and the pizza sub was no different we ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order
0,words "epic fail" get thrown around a lot these daysbut i really feel like they apply in this situationwe went on friday april 2 and arrived at 5:10pm  it was busy but not crowdedno waiting for a table  half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20the food (just appetizers mind you) didn't arrive till almost 6pm  drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow  we placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15they arrived at 6:52  *37 minutes for beer*by 7:00 we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour  we just wanted to leaveinstead of comping anything they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills  uhhhh yeah  thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back   we finally were able to leave around 7:30bar louie:  you are dead to me
0,were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm the 2 of us got to bar louie at 8:30  we sat outside and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order  i tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'  finally the waiter took our order  1 sam adams light bottle and one pineapple juice+vodka  after about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager i don't know) asked if we had been waited on we said yes and told him we had been waiting  he left and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks they were wrong my date was given vodka on the rocks and i was given a sam adams they took these back and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served we told them to bring another round and the check  it was 20 minutes before they returned and they forgot the checkby this time we had to go to be on time for the movie my date asked for the check again so we could leave finally they brought it and i gave him my card when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the moviefor 2 bottle beers and 2 pineapple juice + vodka i was charged $3103 i didn't have time to complain or ask i won't be going back
0,the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get servicenothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first i came here on saturday ay 6pm almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes i was there i counted 9 waitress again i counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order just from the looks of it i could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck so after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies
0,was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice sunny day and we decided to drive to waterfront and walk around all around great day until we hit bar louie for some drinks and appetizersi am giving it one star though it deserves none because our waitress was nice if a bit inattentive and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desiredthis is probably the first place i've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks to me that is beyond ridiculous bar louie is not an upscale restaurant as much as they wish they were and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined as i mentioned the waitress was friendly but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough i really wanted to like this place because of things i had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good but if it want to spend that kind of money i'll go somewhere that i can get good service
0,came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food unfortunately i cannot because the service was so bad that i left before i had the chance to order we found seats at the bar behind the taps after sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged we thought that they might not be able to see us and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order it was fairly busy but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and i'm sure they face much busier times we sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (i timed it - i am not exaggerating) and were not even acknowledged you would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could but despite staring him down almost the whole time we could not even make eye contact i hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out
0,absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt  and in looking at other reviews i am not the first  there are many options at the waterfront and i would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place
0,are chatting not paying attention to tables i can see my salad is ready at the window worst serves ever
0,i just don't see the appeal bar louis has to pittsburghers i guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the waterfront stopping in after a shift it's always packed being so close to the amc theater they get traffic before and after movies it's expensive the food is so so before i get ahead of myself i had the bbq ranch chicken salad without chicken the bbq ranch dressing was very good but it's very easy to duplicate at home it's equal parts ranch dressing and kc masterpiece hickory bbq sauce and a drop or two of worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight daily drink and happy hour selections but even that's not enough to get me here skip it one caveat for this location free parking at station square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopyi'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when burgatory opens across the street
0,stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie our server was friendly my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to meboth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol  after i finished my drink i used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust) a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap ugg did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap she comped the drink but we won't be backcan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself
0,can't even review this place we sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left and i have to be clear it was a saturday afternoon maybe like 10 tables with people at them and i saw 3 waitress walking around i think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant especially since burgatory just opened across the street
0,had the worst possible experience at the eat n park at waterfront on 21210 at around 10pm our waitress (annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order we ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check one of my friends ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which according to the menu description should've had lettuce and tomato in it but the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients when pointed out to the waitress she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate how crude spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order and that had been forcibly thrust upon us when i asked the manager about the buffalo chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that buffalo chicken sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato what a lame excuse even your online menu says under the description for a buffalo chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - "served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked kaiser roll" - that's what the last line in the description of buffalo chicken sandwich says shame on you manager for lying instead of admitting her fault she was blaming it to a new menunot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience i am never going to come back to any eat n park location ever again and will never recommend one to any of my friends either what a waste of time and money plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness i surely had my patience tested this evening
0,bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer
0,awaywe've been 3 times over the past few years each time we say "let's try it again" followed by "wish we'd done something else"reminds me of the movie line "run away run very far away"last nite after steelersjets was last straw i hope the owner or general manager reads this and think the health department should tooservice is mediocre and slow consistently waitress was ok in attitudeafter our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains noticing us staring at her waitress stopped by went into kitchen came back and said we were next my watch said 8:31 then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived that's 21 minutes to be next in that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main manager embarrassed himself said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon i told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't then i said i used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no i didn;t and i had no idea what i was talking about what an idiot first rule of restaurant business is the customer is always rightthen the food arrived how hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms seriously it was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce while the sauce did have some marsala in it it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny the penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor we were so hungry we ate most and left1 hour later i was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning
0,husband and i are cubs fans and flew into pittsburgh to see friday and saturday's cubs-pirates game this past weekend (77 & 8)  we got to pnc park around 5 pm and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game  we stopped first at atria's  although there was only one other table occupied outside we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people who were eating food needed it  this was ridiculous  to us so we left  we were paying guests just like their other guests  anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at dominic's  we went to dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 and did up getting food  atria's better rethink how they treat guests
0,i hate this place  people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like  the food is overpriced  the service is snotty and slow  i can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half  the food is forgettable and the menu sparse  they're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead you're made to wait and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food  you can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere  try soho or finnegan's instead
0,i don't want to judge all atria's by this one in fact i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience but let me tell you i was highly disappointedi will point out the good parts of the night first we arrived to see a band play the entertainment was great didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person) and i liked the set up in the room where they played also the soup i got (crab bisque) was deliciousok now for the rest of the experience first of all our service was awful i don't know our server's name and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault as there was a large party upstairs but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks another 15 before we even got them ten more minutes before we could order our food and after the meal we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain i saw him checking on other tables and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy as a server myself i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt but it really got to be too much the one thing i will say for him though was that he was very nice but for how much we waited we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology before we had to complainthe rest of the food and drinks were okay good but not enough to make up for the service i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eati'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together
0,came here on the fourth of july after getting off of work my friend and i stopped for one drink before the fireworks let's just say i will never return i stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar the bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact they then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside it took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me i am a bartender and i am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place i am a phenomenal tipper being that i am in the industry and sadly i didn't leave a single dollar hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers  what a shame
0,eating lunch several days a week at atrias pnc park restaurant for many years i have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portionsquality and will not be dining there anytime in the near futuregradually over the past year the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals  recently the portion size has significantly diminished to the point of being almost comical todaythe fish "special" today was bbq salmon with asparagus  it consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus  it actually looked ridiculous on the plate  the specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish included a decent portion of vegetables and rice all for a dollar or two less  while a bit more than i wanted to spend for lunch at least the quality and size of portion made some sense  today i spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like i had eaten an appetizer and still hungrythey have pushed it too far i am no longer willing to waste my money at atria's  too bad we used to really enjoy lunch there
0,was meeting up with 3 other people there but i was a few minutes late  because i wasn't there at the time  they refused to seat the others  not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered  so they left to go to some place that would serve them (dominic's)  this place clearly couldn't be bothered to have our business  which seems like an odd way to run an organization  one star because we didn't get anything that we wanted
0,you walk into a buzzing restaurant you'd expect to be greeted by someone be that a server a greeter or the bartender i went in last night stood around for almost 10 minutes and was completely ignored i was meeting a few friends so i decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later  reservation confirmed and beer finished i walk back over walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone he finishes we make eye contact he nods and walks away my friends come in we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us i tell her we have reservations she acts like it can't happen and that it's my mistake she says that the place is closed for a private party i ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party' and i get a ridiculous answer that the "ceo doesn't like us to do that" how dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed the fake sincerity is what really got me you know what a 'private party' sign does it advertises that you are available for private parties and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements
0,was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute worst place i've ever eaten at -hair in the food-crab cakes were touted as amazing in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise -"risotto" uncooked and congealed to plate -vegetables gummy and soaked in oil not properly prepped and served with woody stems i was shocked this place turns a profit
0,of business
0,place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money the following is an email that i sent to the owner it will shed a little light as to why i feel this wayi will also share his response and what ultimately became of the situation i know this one is long winded but you should be forewarned about giving them your moneyi have been to your bar many times and i have had both good and less than average experiences but this past saturday was terrible my girlfriend and i came to have some dinner around 9 pm we knew it would be crowded due to the penguin game and that wasn't a problem when we arrived there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere we decided to have a beer and wait after the game was over some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited after about 5 minutes a waitress came over cleaned our table and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks sadly this was the last time that she ever came to our table we placed our closed menus at the end of the tablenothing we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menusnothing we sat and waited for more than 15 minutes all the while we were waiting another group of four sat the table next to us they were never given any attention they got up and left after being completely ignored i understand that the restaurant was busy and that service and wait times may be impacted but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling it was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room at this point we were disgusted and got up and left i was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman the waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with this seems to be a problem because on some of my past less than stellar experiences the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers on those occasions it was the same thing they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service you don't need to improve your wait staff you need to replace some of them at least the people working the back dining room on this past saturday they were completely useless will i come back to your restaurant i'm not sure the food is good but i work hard for my money and i expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it sincerely matt khere is the response that i gotplease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter i'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen againthank you for making me aware of the situationjoey demarco i promptly called him as soon as i got this email it went to voice mail  so i left a message that was it the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call it is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money support local businesses but make sure they are deserving of your money
0,place looks like something from the godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables the food was cooked well but lackluster i got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth on the plus the staff was very nice and very attentive management - you really need to update the place
0,food was plain and boring our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check the dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell the manager on duty did apologize but that was it there was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall fortunately no one was seriously injured but i really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy the place was noisy and it was pricey
0,staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and i thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner well it was overpriced and the food was terrible i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room the pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy the chicken was overdone (dry) and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale very bad food and overpriced not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful she then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word though i met eye contact with her as soon as it happened she was more interested in talking with the other waitressesyou know she got a great tip :)try another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotelatrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff http:wwwatriascom
0,wish i could give this place no stars we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad1 hour latler a stale blt and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out i was still waiting for my cesar salad the chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it when we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem after an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals here is the kicker hahawe were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away no tip for you my friend this is not how you do business especially when there are other options besides soho to choose from for lunch
0,looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years   after waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived  hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life   it is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were
0,redeeming qualities here schwill on tap food was terrible - had the pizza mac & cheese bites and spinach & artichoke dip  it was hardly edible stay away
0, the hotel ordered sirloin steaks no steak knife no mashed potatoes no asparagus as ordered so check your order i mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip i would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left but skip the 20% $10 room service fee & http:wwwsohopittsburghcom walk downstairs
0,went on a weeknight  place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken  we ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so  food was luke warm at best  i would not go back

0,jumbot plate o'crap - made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the dor-stopwe both made the same order guy's jumbot when the order arrived mine was over cooked  the egg portion resembled the dry pressed paper used in the egg carton my serving was served without cheese my son's was fine when i went to pay and said something i got a vacant stare and i am so sorry i ended up with a take out for my dog to eat teh toast was perfect though i started makeing this hour long trek with family members about a year ago we would come out about every 4-6 weeks the last two trips the quality has started to slip a littlebut never to this extent that it really matteredsave yourself the effort this is not a diner this is not a drive-inthis does not even rank high enough to be a dive denny's would be a better choice
0,what it's worth dor-stop isn't good as people say it was people are fanatical about this place and its food is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show from my perspective i detest their service the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable also the food was unpalatable i order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs i was too full and their portion is huge so i left two pieces of pancakes the waitress don't even bother to ask me if i need a box to take it home or if everything is good although she did refilled my coffee once i barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customersi think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when i tipped her i should have known i just feel like they treated me differently that's all this review is based on my dinning experience and the service seriously if they mean business they should improve especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm do i want to come back never ever
0,really really wanted to try dor - stop but it wasn't open when i went my wife and i woke up early just to go there and the diner was closed for the next few days even though it didnt say that on the website such a waste of time if you're going to go make sure you call ahead just so you don't get screwed over like we did
0,pancakes pancakes  everybody told me i had to try and their pancakeswell the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes
0,place has the worst french fries i have ever tasted they were literally black all i tasted was burnt oil my photo is the zucchini planks and that lump of blackness are the french fries that i was sent home with i could not even eat one i also ordered the zucchini planks and a grilled cheese on rye with bacon the grilled cheese was incredibly dry and the cook put the bread together upside down like it did not match upone piece of bread was the opposite way than the other also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should ugh the zucchini planks were delicious 1 out of 3 is not great my sister raved about this place i am so disappointed disgusting do not eat here i spent $30 for only one edible thing worth $4 so pissed
0,is a bad representation of this location attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this "employee" i will not return
0,was really excited the day after new years to get a bagel with my best friends i traveled all the way from milwaukee to see upon arrival the place was pretty busy with people who obviously frequented the establishment often we don't have many bruegger's in wisconsin so it was my first time here and it was not an enjoyable experience to say the leastit began by me placing my order and asking for my sandwich without the tomato spread the worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel i politely stated my preference and moved along the older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got i said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees the cashier responded with k i asked okay and he responds with i need to know what size i shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe he's bummed to be working on new yearsthen when i get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it which i politely asked for it without yet was interrupted the man literally says "ma'am i don't know what you actually ordered and tomato is different than tomato spread like i'm sorry what the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato pretty sure that's impossible to get confused with i tried so hard to not say a big screw you too he made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasn't so rude when we were paying i probably would've shrugged it off i had too much pride thoughthen he comes up to me and says ma'am just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly you shouldn't do that next time k maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a bruegger'sand to put this into perspective i worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did i feel the need to be that rude to anyone it sucks but it's not my fault
0,to a high tea here on sunday  although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming the food was nothing special in fact it was bad  we were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad which was bland (i make a better version at home) chicken salad nothing special either and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite  unfortunately it was the size of a quarter it was literally a bite  but it was the best part of the meal  (i don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread)we were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog   neither was anything special eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoeverthen the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like vanilla pastry shop  a pumpkin torte again fine  and a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone  it looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white mouse separated from brownie  yuck  oh yeah--i had a delicious tea from harney and sons (used to be sold at the grand floridian high tea in disney world) cinnamon spice  unfortunately when i asked for more tea they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag i've gone to various teas so i feel i can give a good comparison  not impressed at all  will not go back there ever
0,really hate giving bad reviews but the seafood was terrible here  you could tell we were eating old shrimp the salmon was also old and had a super strong fish odor  cost was too expensive we paid $50 for two dinners one pop and one margarita  the salsa was just ok  the only thing that was good was the margarita but i went there for seafood very disappointing
0,location is closed
0,months of passing this place and wanting to try their food we finally made it to kkl  what we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish shrimp and chips (french fries from a bag i'm sure)  the shrimp was different and tastey i had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms  chris had clams chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about  this meal was close to $30 dollars   some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place however for the area the food which isn't like just from the ocean it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating heremy advice skip this place if you can
0,i really have to give them even one star in the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch  had the shrimp plate with fries here goes:1  the prices are outrageously high considering location restaurant decor and quality of food you cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp  any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that2 my shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape this is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer3  the shrimp had too much batter  at one point the "shrimp"( what was left of it after i took a bite) came out and the "barrel of fried batter" was left4  the french fries were from a bag --frozenbeing from the east coast i know what fresh seafood tastes like this is not it folks  this place makes long john silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too  it is an outrage as a "restaurant"  all they do is fry up every piece of seafood that you can buy frozen at costco or sam'sdon't do this to yourself  when you are in the area and hungry go to the jack in the box across the street or some other fast food place you'll be better off and i cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real they have to be the relatives of the owners  there is no other explanation
0,sorry what this place was the worst first of all it's a major dive in a thoroughly sketchy area (shares parking lot with really gross strip club and there's another one across the street) the food is horrible horrible thick bland raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found $435 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder fries were soggy and bland clams were bland as well i've had frozen that were better cocktail sauce was even bland seriously if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place otherwise look elsewhere
0,is the negative 2 stars button  they take cheap fish we assume they thaw it before throwing it on the floor for the flavor and into the grease (which smells lovely by the way)then they serve this bland unseasoned "food" to you and laugh all the way to the bankno taste buds  this is the place for you  the last time i entered was was cuz purely by accident  the next time will be duck hookers and bullets  never again on purpose  there's not even any cats near their dumpster  animals have keen 7th sensesthey owe me $12 and 40 mins of my life back  and ppl thought pete's was bad
0,people where not very nice  i don't normally waist time writing bad reviews on things i don't like something should be said   this place was horrible  don't waist you're time or money
0,food servers seem like drug addicts crab legs are over priced precut and frozen go elsewhere for seafood
0,suggested mandy's so i swung by for some dinner ordered a special of 3 pieces of cod & 3 shrimp with fries & a drink asked for the 1 cod with english breading the other 2 with cornmeal got the reverse the shrimp were fine nothing special the cornmeal cod was perfect cooked just right & crunchy as expected the english style were over-breaded greasy flat small pieces of some non-cod white fish that was so overcooked it was blacknever got a cup for a drink but i'm not a soda drinker to begin so no major loss yet still feel jipped the fries were limp & flavorless not impressed at all either my coworkers have crappy taste or the cook at dinner time had a very off night considering there was one other person in there it's not like they were rushed & should've messed up the order to this level of epic bad made me wish jack in the box would bring back their fish & chips n
0,first & last order i had mandy's special 3 fish & 3 shrimp fried mushrooms clam strips coleslaw & potato salad the clam strips were good portion size was tiny mushrooms were nicely breaded & picture perfect looking but mushy inside & tasted like the frying oil was used over & over to cook both clams & shrimp the shrimp actually had an oily taste & mouth feel my coleslaw had actual 14 inch slices of carrots & onions while the potato salad was all mush along with the ff i got the cod fish after i finished blotting the oil from the pieces & reheated them it wasn't bad i just couldn't understand why i was in the kitchen cooking when i had ordered out for the money i certainly expected better sadly i really love seafoodusually
0,know i have tried to like sir edmond's i really have  i've gone there a bunch of times and i really like the outdoor patio seating especially the big cherry tree that has such beautiful blossoms in the spring and would be the perfect place to take a chick on a first or second date and they do have a descent selection of brew on draught i do like ye old speckled hen but well their food sucks  the last time i went there i ordered the fish and chips mainly cause this is a pub and i was feeling nostalgic for my days in london so i wanted some fish and chips and thought they might actually be goodwrong  the fish and the batter were uncooked and i had to send it back not once not twice not three times but four times and on the last time it still wasn't right i just didn't feel like sitting there anymore and my brother had already finished his burger which did look good  did the waitress offer me anything for my trouble nope  which brings me to my next complaint the service and the whole atmosphere is really kind of rude and stuffy maybe i'm just not cool enough but they always seem to busy to serve me and the whole low ceiling basement bar thing is not my bag  other people love sir edmond's i know i've heard rave reviews for their burgers and their lamb sandwich this place just isn't for me
0,edmond bland's is what it should be called food was all bland sauerkraut was bland potatoes were bland corned beef was bland it was all around bland
0,used to love sir ed's however my recent visit was bad enough to make it my last the waitress alone was an example on how you don't treat your patrons she was irritable and snippy until the check came suddenly when it was tip time she was courteous i wish i'd left her less and overall i'm a strict 20% tipper the food was not good either my fries tasted like fish the wrap was awful and it took forever the only good thing was the beer but you can get that at better restaurants
0,don't give 1-star often but i think this "staple" has earned it with the "winning" combo of overpriced food & beer lack of menu options and non-existent service i came here on friday to join a few friends after work for drinks and for the free personalized guinness pint glass offer the bartender turned out to be also the waiter for us in the back dining room which means we seldomly saw him he wasn't exactly friendly but i guess he got the job done at the minimum since he did bring us our beer and put in our food order and checked on us every now and then but was a smile that hard to come by do i really have to be a regular to get any friendly service worst was the food runner which we didn't know that's her only job there (not like they have waitstaff uniforms on for us to distinguish) so when a late comer asked her to take his beer order she snapped back "i am not your waiter"  well thank goodness she wasn't our waiter with that attitude more interestingly this very same food runner had to deliver a dish to the corner table next to ours that was blocked in by 2 big tables (ours and another one) instead of doing her job the right way and walk around the both big tables to get to the corner table she just pretty much demanded my friend to get up & push in the chair so she could squeeze by how lazy and unprofessional was that that pretty much set the tone for an unpleasant night for meto add salt in a wound besides guinness that was on special at the bargain price of $4 fat tire was $5 i didn't think fat tire is that caliber of a beer food was pricey as well $4 for a basket of fries but with curry sauce (which would be the only reason i order frieschips in an english pub) is $5 $14 for fish & chips and that didn't look like a huge order they had more wings options than anything thing else but if i want wings i probably would have gone to somewhere else i ended up with $850 of blacken fish tacos it was ok the fish still had lots of liquid after being cooked which didn't mix well with the slaw and tortilla wrap i did enjoy the cup of soup as my side in short i echo the other reviewer: i'll go to big ben any day over this joint if i am feeling a british pub mode at least they have better menu options and most certainly better service
0,this place several times on the chance the first time i went they were just having an off night i was wrongthe bartender and the server were rudeand the prices sky highboth times left me with a bad taste in my mouthenough saiddon't waste your time
0,food average atmosphereit did not live up to the billing it had been given by a friend
0,was awful but the waitress was nice it's dead here and the food was awful will not be back such a shame because the location is great
0,had the absolute worst experience here yesterday when i came here for my friend's birthday dinner the waitress could not have been any more rude i really don't think i've ever had such a rude waitress one of the many instances where she was rude was when she messed up my order i politely asked about the missing cheese in my order of cheese fries after she picked up the plate my friend asked for his appetizer (she brought my order but hadn't taken his) she cut him off y sternly saying "how about i fix his fries first before they get cold" then walked away when she brought them back she said "next time you want cheese tell me" our entire group was speechlessi have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life i highly recommend you avoid the place
0,to be my favorite it has gotten worse and worse every time i have gone here over the years this last experience takes the cake i ordered a hamburger with no mustard no mayo and cheddar cheese it came out with swiss cheese (not a big deal) but it also had mustard and mayo i let the server know and i must note that i was not mean or rude about it at all mistakes happenthe burger came back moments later with cheddar cheese slapped on top of the swiss and the mustard and mayo gone how does someone get mustard and mayo out of the nooks and crannies of a burger by rinsing it with water i presume so the burger came back cold slightly wet cheddar cheese (not melted) on top of the old cheese disgusting absolutely disgusting the server said nothing even when he saw me not even take one bite after approaching the manager she took it off the bill i am not saying that i need anything for free but i did come there to eat left hungrier than i arrived and then still had to go through the chick-fil-a drive thru after paying $30 for 2 drinks and the meal of the other person at the tablenever again
0,went to the avenue and it is not good  the ham and cabbage soup was pure salt  it might be nice in the winter for melting the sidewalk but certainly not a taste treat  my partner ordered the fried walleye which was both bland and dry  completely flavorless  i had the duck special which was also dry and bland  the wild rice side was pretty good  overall this was a very disappointing experience  skip the avenue bar
0,friday night at avenue bar was one to remember not because it had the best food or the best service but because my visit proves you can't always judge a restaurant by ranking or reviews i will not be returning anytime soon  my goal in writing this review is not to bash on the avenue bar you won't need to after you read my play by play of the night 7:00-3 friends and myself arrive at the restaurant we give our name and head to the bar being told it was an hour wait to be seated thank god basketball was on tv or we might have fallen asleep waiting8:20-we are seated in the back room right next to the kitchen we had the luxury of sitting in foldup metal chairs on at a pull out card table with a cheap plastic table cloth-not the cool wooden tables or a booth like in the bar room i honestly felt discriminated against because we were 24 year olds i saw no young people seated in the bar room and saw so many booths with two people at them i thought it was universal date night instead we were with "our type" in the back room receiving second hand service my waitress spilled water on me while attempting to fill my glass and just giggled and put napkins over it haha are you serious again thank god there were big screen tvs to watch or i might have cried out loud 8:45- fish fry arrives; soggy greasy and not very warm best part of my meal was the spotted cow and cheese curds for an app 9:15-i feel sick and want to go to sleep my night is overadvice for anyone under the age of 30- don't eat here go somewhere fun where you are treated equally food and drinks-30 bucks gas money to get there-6 bucks never eating there again-priceless thanks for reading
0,had drinks at 4:15 on a wednesday at 6:30 a woman we had not spoken to zipped by at said "you have been here a long time other people are waiting for your table" off she went before we could saywell probably something rude we saw no one waiting even i have never ever in my life been treated that way before unbelievable that any establishment could get by with that behavior this place has been living off it's reputation for years with poor food and questionable atmosphere catering to the geriatric crowd it has a convenient location but never again
0,cod dinner and by far it was one of the worst fish dinners i have ever had very greasy fish and mushy fries for $1395 and 2 small pieces of cod it was way over rated
0,wait (45 mins for my table (with reservation) and 125hrs for food) for subpar food on a sunday morning i would have been fine with this wait if i had gotten the level of service and food i was expecting at the avenue the quality and deliciousness of food has gone down since the new owners took over but the price has gone up thank you to food fight for ruining a madison staple for me there are too many better supper clubs awesome fish fry's and amazing brunch places in madison to waste my time here i won't be back
0,food is very mediocre  the wait is often long even if you get a table quickly the service and food tends to be slow  their fish fry is greasy and boring the rest of the menu items are sometimes decent but overpriced  this place survives on its' reputation and the fact that some people don't like food that tastes like anything
0,was very dissapointed with the avenue bar my boyfriend and i went there for dinner the atmosphere was fine seemed like a supper club type joint we expected some delicious classics i ordered the fish fry and he had the eggplant parmesan the fish fry was average and the french fries were dissapointing and boring my boyfriend's eggplant parm was more like a lasgana and was cold in the middle with a bill that was over fifty dollars for food and one beer i expected more than just heated frozen food the dinner was a waste of money unfortunately we will not go back i will say that at least our server was very welcoming and great at his job
0,place was a madison institution now drinks are weak and my wife and i have been sick for the past two days after having breakfast there thank goodness we have two toilets in our house great job food fight
0,disappointed in the customer service attitude of the staff stopped in to have drinks with friends and the bar area was very cold we were informed the htg wasn't working but it was fine in the dining room  we tried to open the door between but was rudely informed by the chef we could not do so i'm a long term customer and that attitude was never part of the avenue bar  and what chef dictates who gets to be warm or cold
0,have been to christy's quite a few times over the years and have never had a very good meal; however last night's meal was a disaster it started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong one member of our party received a different potato than ordered 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and i had the worst fish fry ever it could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake) the baked potato tasted dry and leftover the one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience christy's is back on my list of places to avoid
0,service we had made reservations for at least 16 people for dinner a week prior to dining there they managed to get the tables together that's about it while waiting for our group to arrive we had drinks outsidewe should've gone directly to the tiki bar to get our drinks that woman knew what she was doingour "waitress" however probably couldn't velcro her own shoes when we sat to eat we had 2 waitresses (they decided it took 2 to wait on us) one rocked it the other couldn't velcro her own shoe our 12 of the grouptable had to deal with our appetizers being put in front of us (with a "who's is it" call from the same waitress who took our order) then our meal being placed in front of us not 15 seconds later my 5 year old daughter not only got a very cold ("made fresh") pizza but it included something we didn't ordera dead fly between the pizza and plate it was served on nowi would've sent it back but i didn't want to wait until midnight for my kid to get her food not to mention my son only got half of what he orderedafter our "lovely" experience with dinner we stuck around for drinks all i can say isyou better have cleavage to get a drink insideno matter how busy or slow they are if you want to sit and have a drink and look at the lake go to their tiki bardebbie rocks she's the only one that knows what "good service" is
0,place is good only for the outdoor atmosphere their online menu does not correspond to their actual menu buy they don't seem to see this as a problem i requested my favorite beer: "oh we're out of that" then my second favorite: "we're out of that too" as a vegetarian i had to order a black bean burger which was burned as was the bun i asked for a dark or spicy mustard no they just have the mainstream basics combine this with extremely mediocre service i will never eat there again
0,service ever we sat down at a dirty table (because all the tables were dirty) around 12:15 pm we ordered margaritas on the rocks with salt we got no salt so we waited another 5-10 mins for our salted margs then we waited for our order to be taken for about another 10-15 mins while our server was standing next to the kitchen well we ordered and it was now 1:57pm and our food was still not to our table one of us had ordered nachos and at 1:57 they came to tell us they were out of tortilla chips are you joking that's something they should have known from first hand i will never go back i've worked in restaurants since i was 15 and i've never seen any sort of thing like this before we were not the only table waiting for our food that long either
0,got back from this restaurant for the third time it is close to where we live and like the convenience of going there this was the last time though when we arrived we where told we needed to wait 5 to 10 mins for a seat after 15 mins we where seated in a room with 10 open tables (not sure why we needed to wait)  about another 15 mins went by and 2 other tables where seated and served drinks and still no one waited on us  no one ever did so we left the other times that we have been the food is only mediocre for bar food at best
0,made the mistake of eating at the stable grill it had been a while since we had been there the service was terrible the food was also nothing to write home about i think it will be another five years before we venture back if ever againvery disappointing
0,and over ratedif you had $30 worth of kobe beef would you smother it in mayo and syrupy barbecue sauce  quivey does and it's a good thing to because it's the worst kind of nasty that i have tasted  if your are looking for an excess of pretension with a complete lack of quality that is significantly over priced look no further
0,family has been coming here for years  i called at 3 pm today to make a reservation for dinner and was treated so rudely on the phone i'll never come back
0,trying for 30 mins on and off to order a delivery i get voice mail and nothing else
0,give it zero stars if possible  plaza close this bar
0,hate this placeit's very loud the service is very poor and the food is so-soif you want good chinese in pittsburgh try china palace (shadyside) or sesame inn (station square or north hills)  they're quieter with very good food & service
0,i'm furious i enjoyed pf chang's restaurants in the chicago area and my wife and i have eaten a few times at this pittsburgh-area location over the last year we have tried repeatedly but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable we tried going early late -- it never made any difference the front staff was rude and the wait was too longtonight we had a special date planned and made reservations a week in advance we came in the door exactly on time waited in the line to see the front staff and we were promptly handed a pager they couldn't tell us when we would be seatedi imagined a short wait so we went outside crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating)after 20 minutes we gave up we went back to pf chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated i saw open tableswhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor themthe food here is good but certainly not great we went to a local thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes the food was much better the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant oh and the local place was a much more reasonable pricewe certainly will never visit pf chang's again
0,was my first time at this pf chang's and i was not impressed the service was extremely slow even though it was a sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy the portions were small they were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud pop music come on--this is an "asian bistro"
0,unwelcoming short haired black hostess drinks were not good greasy spring  rolls below par on every way  no experience needed to work here
0,in tonight wednesday at 9:50 the place was empty asked for a table the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it  the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door when she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again  didn't say a word to us unbelievable  will not be back there-- rude hostess
0,went last night saturday night to pfchang located at the kierlands in scottsdale terrible experience after waiting over one hour to be seated we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side then i ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce  after a long wait my food came so salty that i could not even eat and as much as i hate to complain but i had to let the waiter know so he went to get me one with less salt my husband's dish was ok then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach i feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat very bad experience our waiter was kind and sympathetic ruined my evening out :(
0,me start off by saying i have mostly simple tastes and my favorite lunch spot for chinese has been the new dumpling house in squirrel hill but since that restaurant is undergoing renovations i was forced to try something newso i thought i'd try the chain pf chang's chinese restaurant at the waterfront wow what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to bei started with a cup of their wonton soup at $295 it wasn't too outrageous of a price the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than i was used to including three giant basil (i think) leafs that covered everything beneath in the broth were chunks of chicken two shrimp some sliced water chestnuts and two "pork"-filled wontons as i said the broth had decent flavor but the wontons were thick doughy and under-cooked and the chicken chunks were dry which is amazing since they were drowned in broth on a scale of bad to good it was kind of mehnext came my "lunch-portion" order of chang's kung pao chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more) at the new dumpling house this dish is served with a delectable dark rich tangy sauce which i was really hoping for not at pf chang's on my plate i received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken 7 hot chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce) a handful of blanched unsalted peanuts a few sliced scallions and a bed of the most bland brown rice i have ever encountered uncle ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxesglaringly there was no sauce none at alli've had kung pao chicken in new york city san francisco and even from a hole in the wall in bethel park pa that was much much better never have i had it served in such a bland skimpy and overpriced way the "lunch-portion" cost was $995at the new dumpling house i could have a delicious lunch with soup entree and complimentary hot tea and i could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tipthe service was decent however lesson learned one and done never going back to pf changs
0,was so disappointed with the quality the salad was drenched in vinegar the duck was mediocre  i guess i'm used to really good food from foodie towns  if i wanted mediocre food i would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable  yes for quality of food  the price obviously was much more  this fake fusion place would have gone out of business regardless of price if it had to compete with the likes of slanted door or was located in a city with good food  if this is representative of the best pittburgh has to offer then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to sf or nyc and eat well for a week how sad is that  don't go here you pay $30 for an entree $10 for an appetizer and $15 for a mediocre wine  not worth it
0,down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh appalling service i went there with 6 people restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by the lounge was empty was there from 8-11 she didn't check on us once we had to flag her down  complained to the manager with no response nyc prices as well very embarrassed for the big burrito company
0,have been regulars at soba for years sharing a few appetizers at the bar-lounge on a quiet evening and enjoying the food last night was different for the very first time the food was awful  a scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake the chef who we learned was new obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together this was pure glue tasteless and sticky where was the content the taste the flavor the lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out chinese eatery oily mostly a pulled pork appetizer was passable nowhere near the dish it replaced find a new chef quicklyjohn e raffie
0,food here was greasy uninspired and bland the mockmeat "chicken" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy it was something i grew tired of in a matter of five or six bitesi was also disappointed that they don't serve brown ricethe service was friendly enough though not to be recommended unless you're desperate
0,who reviewed this place as being good obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds)came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in wanted to go to pamela's but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to china palace i was really wary because i did a quick yelp search before we walked in but my dad insisted that it was probably "not that bad"here's what we ordered:- cheese wontons (um they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons who does that it's supposed to be cream cheese and they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in)- chicken lo mein- beef lo mein- shrimp and broccoli w sweet and sour soup (the soup was the most disgusting texture of i-don't-know-what needless to say that was left untouched)let's just say not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of lesser quality than chinese takeout) the food itself was just utterly disappointing a complete travesty to chinese cuisine it was bland yet greasy and msg-ridden (if that makes any sense) not only that they also didn't have beef chow fun (ok so whoever claims this restaurant serves "authentic" chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about) and the kicker it came out to about $32 + tip for food that we didn't even finish half of we literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of ricedo not go here  unless you're a snake that is
0,worst chinese food i've had i got the general tso's chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when i asked for extra spicy panda express is better
0,sum we ordered take out here a few days ago there were bugs in my egg drop soup nuff saidusually i write these long reviews not today i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out i specifically ordered the egg drop to have for lunch yesterday fortunately for me- i noticed the bugs prior to eating looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup disgusting
0,i  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until i return the wonton soup was watery and the wontons were inedible i ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and i surmised that they didn't think i would notice also i think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty
0,have never ever thrown food away but i couldn't stomach this stuff i got the pork fried rice and egg drop soup holy moly was that a poor decision the rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy "pork" it tasted nothing like pork or meat for that matter i tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help the soup was a weird creamy mess my friend got the general tso chicken which should generally be a safe choice wrong cardboard cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened
0,general tso that i ordered for delivery tasted like fish i called and verna tried to convince me that it was because i made the mistake of not requesting white meat she then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish this was interesting because i am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that i ordered were indeed deep friedin the same oil that my chicken was fried in she told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if i bring it in myself very rude and horrible customer service
0,a craving for chinese the other day while i was in shadyside and wandered into china palace  how this place can stay in business in an area that i consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery  it was just awful and the service was terriblei wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter but asked if i could substitute one of the items with dumplings  our waiter had to ask the manager  after much whispering the manager came back to me and told me that i could have dumplingsthen i asked if i could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed   well i was met with an outraged "no"  it kind of surprised me that i got this kind of reaction  i was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter  i looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant  isn't that what they're supposed to do  cook food for people to eat  i would have never asked if i thought it would be such a big deal  anyway the food was not very good  in fact it was awful  were they having an off day   i'm not sure they were   there's never any reason to be rude to your patrons  no need to ever return
0,limited options in uptown i gave this place a few chances  it's just not good  i got some eel that wasn't fresh and i haven't been able to eat eel since  i also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in
0,the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that i have left before getting my food me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon that we had purchased specifically for fujo they refused to take it and the manager told us "you have two choices ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it" if we had been rude then i wouldn't be able to blame him but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it we walked out and went to emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food
0,roach on the bamboo on my steam dumpling basket i got up and left this is the only time i've gotten up and left besides an hour wait at denny's  f'ing gross
0,there were no insect carcasses in my food i was still not very impressed with my meal at pf chang's  i went for a "business lunch" with my boss  who thought i would ever enjoy working more than eating--i think this meal was a firsti got steamed veggies and brown rice  now i expected it to be pretty bland since it mentioned no sauces added at all  but the vegetables were rubbery not crisp like they should be after a good steaming the rice was pretty underdone as well so all-in-all they got nothing right  i tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit but it was too little too lateperhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup  i usually add pepper to mine because i like the extra kick but this needed much more help than a little pepper  it was very bland and didn't taste like anything  tasteless egg in water is definitely not something you want to keep eating  and of course there was no salt and pepper on the table so i couldn't even enjoy it the way i like because i didn't pay i didn't complain to the waiter but normally this would not have passed by me  though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable i still would not return here if given the choice
0,had a horrible experience getting take out from the local pf changs take out i had been home and not feeling well the last couple of days craving take out from pf chang's i found it the worst food i have ever gotten at from pf changs in 2 states in the last 10 years the gallon of "fresh" tea was so syrupy i could not drink it the vegetarian dish had soggy vegetables and awful tasting curry that i could not eat it the side order of fried green beans was soft soggy and very cold with a poorly made fish sauce on the side i could not eat any of it and i spent a small fortune ordering for my family i would have returned it for a reorder however i have been getting over an illness and not able to drive my daughter who picked it up had to leave what happened to this restaurant it was an awful dining experience and i do expect some type of reparation for this terrible eating experience i ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead just awfulto add insult to injury this is the same restaurant where i found that the wait staff would pocket the change from the bill when paid with cash i let this pass the first time and the 2nd time i asked the manager if this was their policy with an embarrassed looks from the nearby wait staff i used to absolutely love this chain however it has become a poor excuse for a restaurant i wrote the main office
0,on if you want chinese dont go to a chain owned by americans  this is a waste of time and money
0,disappointingi struggled with whether to provide 1 or 2 stars and finally landed on one due to several factors: experience price and overall poor food quality  having visited pfs several times in the past i had vowed not to return but was persuaded by my wife and the nagging popularity of the place that has me asking myself: 'maybe i am missing something here'we did takeout and were told when we called that it would require an hour to prepare the food (we had called at 6pm and were expecting a little time however that seemed excessive)  upon arrival they had screwed up the order and to their credit did try to make things right by providing the food error to us for free while working 'on a rush' to correct the mistake  all fine and good but caused a delay of 25 minutes for our food with a screaming 2 week old in the car  we had lo mein that was excessively greasy while the vegetables lacked any crisp  the dish had little flavor behind the grease but with enough sararchi sauce i could numb my mouth beyond taste it felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave  the portion was large but whats a good sized portion if the food is low quality  my wife had crispy honey shrimp that was slightly better but the portion in this case was on the skimpy side  their heralded lettuce wraps were just ok as well with more water chestnuts than chicken and again lacking much flavor with the overall poor experience we will steer of pfs in the future and look for smaller more locally owned operations for our aisan fix
0,found out that portion size is good then bad i complained to corporate and they blocked my ip address do not go there they have no customer service
0,experience in previous visit in orlando so tried this one in charlotte apps were cold  waiter was loud and too casual  cream curdled in coffee  sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce  after i have been to all other charlotte restaurants we may try it again
0,bad experience two times in a row there must be a shortage of waitstaff in charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at walmart both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half they served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in louisiana big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup waitress looking at me like i was crazy the manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything i mention i was going to write a bad yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away this place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there now i understand why portions are small service is bad and probably better off going to mcdonald's
0,ordered take out from this pf chang's on tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible not only i was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone the food was soggy underprepard and bland for example the kung pao shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy my family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst delay and food preparations aside what really sets me off is that i not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min) i have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude maybe i am spoiled but in every pf changs i have been so far i have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off this time i have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager) in my opinion if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a $110 pickup order made on the phone prepays and still gives $5 tip i expect to get something off the bill here however i have received nothingi will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it sadly it has lost its game - maybe it was the tusday manager
0,horrible experience we were seated and drink order was taken by that person few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered crab rangoons and spare ribs this person said someone would be back to take our order never happened the apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order so we ate our apps and still no one no one even acknowledged us i had to flag someone down and i said "i think our waitress has forgotten about us" the man says "what you want" ummm to order hes like "yes what you want just staring at us no smile or apology so we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later had to wait forever for our check i think we had a different server every time someone stopped by the crab rangoons were simply not crab rangoons there was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever i am not sure what they were but not what i was expecting the shrimp fried rice tasted ok but the shrimps were full of poo not deveined and completely packed with poo just disgusting wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them strong and not really what i was expecting in a wontonwhole dinner sucked to top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor no idea why this place was full many great chinese restaurants around this is not one
0,place is bad the service is bad the food is bad and the prices are high with our party of 4 we had a similar experience as christina l where different waiterswaitresses would come by and awkwardly take our order then someone else would bring out that order and then someone else would arrive to help us further the crab rangoons were very small and tasted generic like something i could buy frozen at food lion and the shrimp in our meals also were not deveined and every dish we ordered was flavorless and bland the only thing i enjoyed was the wonton soup and then at the end of our meal around 9:45pm we stayed at the table to chat being cautious that the restaurant hours printed on the door said they close at 11pm a waitress came to us at 10pm and said that they were closing and they needed us to pay now o_o  so we got up to pay and leave and the cashier man ( looked like the manager ) was so cold he never asked how the food was or anything just "this how much" and swiped the cards such a waste of money and time worst chinese food ever
0,go bought the groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try the location atmosphere and service were all good so no complaints there the food however was not i ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll the chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic i wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat my husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all it had zero garlic taste was way too thick and overall wasn't very good the egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chickencabbage type the place was super busy and i had high hopes but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back
0,food you can tell they use cheap steak and lobster the sauces are not good and they are constantly rushing you i literally had my soup and salad delivered within 30 seconds of each other then the chef comes out to rush us the server is stuck constantly refilling tiny glasses and trying to rush us so we have room for hot food from the chef the chef was entertaining but the food wasn't very good large portions of noodles and vegetables i guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality doesn't work then the server comes out to rush us into boxing up our food the very minute the chef is done how about we get some time to eat and talk boxes were left at the table while we were still eating so that the server could return to constantly filling tiny glasses we wanted to make sure the chef got tipped out but came to find he splits them with the server even that is just wrong the servers are running around hustling people through dinner so they can get the next table in  the place cuts too many corners and rushes you through dinner it's not very good and they take advantage of the wait staff did i mention the hostesses were rude find somewhere better to eat
0,disappointing too expensive for what you get they were just going through the motions without any emotion food had no flavor a lot of veggies very little steak or chicken my son and i ordered different chicken but both orders were prepared the same had to ask for more water still eating when take home boxes were brought out i felt like i had wasted my hard earned money
0,bueno1 tough chewy hamachi with not so fresh flavor2 salty and otherwise bland udon soup wih limp flavorless tempura3 salmon-skin handroll completely overpowered by way too much shizo leaf4 salad with no character and bitter ginger dressingblech  maybe i should have known better than to seek out sushi in wisconsin  for the sake of madison i hope there's better out there
0,hesitated to write about fate i always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old lucky dragon even back when it was on university i also appreciate the fact that fate is a downtown pioneer and that one can eat there after 9:00we've been to fate a number of times with vaguely disappointing results after this visit -- we've had it i'm not really high on the "this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time" style of user review so let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits yet never all at once fate however put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco i don't know if fate's policy is to have the hostesshost inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes but the math doesn't work out the place is tiny we waited forty minutes the next group waited fifty-five minutes the next few groups are probably still waiting their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletonsthe server dropped off some menus mentioned that she was going to bring us some water and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant again fate is tiny so the trick was pretty difficultanyway we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes) stuff arrived it was the old joke -- "the food here is terrible and such small portions"i'll spare most of the hideous details but one lowlight to share involved the sesameshrimpsalad item i'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce rather than some slightly-off shrimp actually why do i care we felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash our cat still wouldn't come near us anyway i don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at fate are malicious the food isn't good enough and the experience isn't good enough oh if you're uncomfortable with ikea furnishings (i'm fine) don't even try it
0,is one of those places that really pisses me off the food is very good the beer is even better and the atmosphere is super-cool it's just the type of place we need more of in downtown phoenix it's even open lateunfortunately i have to give it one lonely star because the service so often sucks more than once i'v been told that because i don't have a reservation i'd have to wait up to 45 minutes despite the fact that the place was less than 50% fullthe final straw was in the middle of july when i was asked to "please wait outside" for my table are you kidding me the food ain't that good
0,i think that people are willing to let anything slide in order to avoid chain restaurants that is why fate is so successfulfate has the rudest staff and worst "wait" policy of any restaurant in town the worst part they make no apology for making you wait outside for a table in 110 degree weather are they on crack outside the whole bar is emptyyet patrons are relegated to the hot dirty front yard why do you make people wait outside when you are emptyone time i went there and only two tables were occupied they told us there would be a 20 - 30 minute wait i asked why there is a wait as nearly all the tables were open the dumb girl at the door kind of shrugged and said they weren't enough waiters so there aren't enough waiters to handle three tables instead of twoat least let us wait inside despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside i said no thanks and stormed off never to return fate is my worst dining experience in arizona so farfate is less than 1 mile from my house so it saddens me it isn't a place i can call home
0,went to fate because i had been hearing from people for a really long time that it was just a fantastic place and i really should try  it happened to be right by the roosevelt where we were actually going to meet up with some of you yelpers  you know who you are people  hi guys  it was funwe parked and walked up and went inside  the decor was nice it seemed to have a decent atmosphere but i am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap  if a place sucks i don't care how chic the atmosphere is  i will call a spade a spade  the place wasn't full quite the opposite really  maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied  so we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which i am fine with but when i ask her if we can wait in inside she says "no  please wait outside"  what the fuck is that about  i could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-i'm-cool music they were playing you could hear crickets chirping in this joint  strike one  so we go outside and wait  she comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus  they must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back  she sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything  so here we are eating in a restaurant that i'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen  oh woe is me  woe woe woe is me  however will i earn my cool points for the monththe waitress was very nice and attentive  i'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker  i realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much  strike twowe order a couple of $4 republic of teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu  the variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness  as anyone who knows me will tell you i don't do sweet  so i order the cantonese dragon beef and my significant other orders the szechuan chickenthe waitress comes back with the pot stickers  they sucked  they were identical to the ones you get at costco  they are just like the ones they serve at casey moore's during happy hour only there they're free  here they cost $6  i eat one and that's it  strike threethen comes the entrees  decent sized portions  i can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but i'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one  mine was in a word crap  the best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird  i didn't even like the mushrooms  i am a mushroom fanatic  if there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't the mushrooms always tip the scales  but they didn't even save this dish  i am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four  so in my disappointment i decide to give my girlfriends szechuan chicken a try  baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now  so now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish  this thankfully was perfectly adequate  now if i go to a fucking chinese restaurant and the best compliment i can give the food is "at least they didn't fuck up the rice" we are in some ugly territory here people  if you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from dj such and such skip fate hit up hunan express and then just go straight to myst or drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night  nuf sed
0,away far awayi had been hearing about fate for a while i had high expectations since i had been to lucky dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was okit was the worst chineseasian i've had in az the service was terrible the chairs uncomfortable and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning and has been sick for the last 2 days from it i took her to the er this morning at 4:30 am and decided to finally start posting on yelp since i've been a lurker for a whileaesthetics:initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city nice patio cool inside  however the seating at a bus stop is more comfy there is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your backi'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the hot and sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share however they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine wtfservice:i don't know a nicer way to say it our waitress was a dopey bimbo it took 20 minutes for her to take our order she went missing for long periods of time when i had an empty water glass and then for a while longer after i tracked her down and asked for some not goodfood:i ran into a friend there and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it to be blunt it was utter crap the hot and sour soup was thin and spicy that's it it tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present it's not like any hot and sour soup i ever had in a bad way there are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg i ordered some saigon basil something or other dish with beef she ordered the lemon grass whatever with tofumy dish was bad the beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy and totally lacked flavor as for basil there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish and that's it the sauce was thin and one dimensional her lemon grass dish was also bad the sauce tasted like tom yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water i felt bad for the poor abused tofui'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but pei wei and pickup sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste screw that even the chinese place in the mall food court is better i am not exaggerating it was a very disappointing mealnow for the nasty parti drank water - fiancee unit drank th 'green tea' it was like no other green tea i ever had seen it was leprechaun green with some kind of milk like substance in iti thought it looked kinda funky but she drank itit was the only difference between our meals i tried hers she tried mine etc i didn't drink the science experiment teawell several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains she spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm i took her to the er at 4:30 am this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now but come on this shouldn't be the end result plus this is downtown phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems if you know what i mean due to lifestyle choicesthere is some great asian food in central phoenix maxim and da vang are great vietnamese places on 19th avethe cultural center has a few great places esp golden buddha thai lahna has been consistently good for yearslike i said i don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the pei wei at 7th ave and mcdowell is way better in terms of food quality
0,haven't yelped in about 2 months and i was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me  well this place was that bad first impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w good views of downtown and the fire pits were nice  no beers on tap though; and seriously what's with the hip-hop club dj at 7:00 pm  come on guys way too early for thatit wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to  oh wait that's right no menus yet good job  ok so i ordered the thai spring rolls which had a filling of lettuce a single strip of carrot and noodles  seriously  main course i ordered the curry which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- i don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick yellow soup with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in  yuck  and then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice  i'm sorry isn't it supposed to be the other way around  my friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (i think they had some sort of stir fry which they said was bland and pointless)so yeah i don't recommend this place  instead head a block over to the roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food
0,hate fate  my fate at fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long  don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrivethe last time i was there i was with a group (bad idea per my comment above)  several folks asked that their food be prepared mild  when the food came every dish on the table was nuclear hot  i can handle hot food but this was on par with los dos molinos  when we mentioned this to our server she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time  she patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (duh) but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food  therefore the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency  frankly any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of workthe concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great  sadly fate falls apart in its executionit's a lot less flashy but you get a consistent meal at china chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food  apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes
0,of all johnny chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef he is barely a line cook as stated in previous reviews he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits)so i made reservations thinking i may be able to sit at the bar because i arrived 10 minutes early wrong i was ordered to wait outside nearly 45 minutes later and a drink at the bar next door i inquired about my table the girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge i had said anything after a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me she finally said my table was ready hmmthe food is horrible i fear those of you who enjoy it rather enjoy the "atmosphere" and come here to be seen the food is either completely bland (eg my curry which tasted of water with a slight hint of something i couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor by calling themselves "authentic asian" cuisine is just silly there are so many hole-in-the-wall asian restaurants that could cook chu under the table blindfoldedso the rude nonexistent service the insanely overpriced food and to be seen is what you're paying for if you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that i wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you
0,has great food but lacks on every other level i live three blocks away so its upsetting to see a place with so much potential fail
0,fate  you were better when you were that hole in the wall on university called lucky dragonboonastiest food ever
0,took two of my friends there who are here in phoenix the first time and the service was terrible  the noodles and other dishes were good as usual but the service we received from the guy was otherwisethat guy talked very fast which didn't bother me as much until he started forgetting our requests  he stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time  when we asked to split the bills in two in certain way it had to be done three times  it just gave me the impression that he didn't really pay attention to what we wantedthis is the first time i went back since last year (rated 45 previously)  hopefully he will improve his service and attitude or else they will lose more customers
0,food is average to slightly above average that isn't what is wrong with cherry blossomthe problem with cherry blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse i have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent today was the final straw my wife and i arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty it was not packed either we were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived the server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us she said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu a few minutes went by then another few minutes then another and by 11:57 our order had still not been taken at that point my wife flagged down the host who took our order i should point out that both my wife and i had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted after informing her that we just gave our order to the host she vanished both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14 neither had arrived at that point more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied we also noticed that these customers who arrived well after we had had been served their salads soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting at that point i went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond my wife and i decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out the last time i was there the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full it just seems to get worse and worse at cherry blossomso in conclusion if you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food this is the place for you it is my belief that management is to blame for cherry blossom's poor service fortunately i can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left cherry blossom will not be getting any more visits from us
0,was definitely one of the worst ramen i have ever had in my life i know i have such high expectations for food especially when it comes to japanese cuisine- but it was just so dissapointing after reading the raving reviews about this place
0,happened to this place i have not been here like a year and everything went down the hill no more banana breadfirst bad service we stood up for 5 minutes in front of main door while inside was not crowded waiter did not bring us a bread i had to ask twice order was slow i saw our food waited in the counter at least 10 minutes i was ready to go and pick it upsushi quality was bad yakisoba noodle was burnedwell i used to go this place alot but i will never go back again what happened to japanese culture - being fast  efficent and respectful i will never come back there are lots of nice places in nort phoenix just go check it out like tokyo lobby yen sushi it will worth a drive and sayanora cherry blossom
0,place made me wanna start a bad-food-diet ok maybe i should start a little more positivethis place has decent ambience that's about it the restaurant staff that i encountered was non-friendly non-welcomy and probably non-existentthe biggest offense is the food i cannot believe so many other reviews were soooo positive i came in a little late (9:15 pm) and that may have rubbed the waiting staff wrong but there were 2 other parties that came in after megoing back to the food i ordered miso ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork) and a side of agedashi tofu 1 the miso ramen came with a slice of salmon  really salmon it was not the best combination to say the least miso there was hardly any miso in the soup it was so diluted i almost had to imagine the taste of miso btw the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen i am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one  2 agedashi tofu this is a freaking joke an insult to the patron of the restaurant really how lazy can this restaurant get essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce what did i get a re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura the sauce dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce3 iced green tea this one is not as bad as some other asian fusion restaurant they actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley  unfortunately it is so very dilluted  the guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking wateri also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table  i know it is sealed but really in front of customersthis place really cut corners in terms of food and service benefit of doubt maybe since i tried this place only once but once is enough for me i saw 2 sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself not impressed at allbottom-line lazy effort at best worst case scenario cheap food costing big bucks giving patrons food-poisoning from re-using left-overs
0,service barely acknowledged when you first walked in slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself will not come again
0,avoid avoid what is this place japanese italian do they know who they are we ordered seaweed salad - i think my frys has better salad for $2; my daughter ordered california rolls - very average; the pad thai was as bland as i have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor - no wonder they offer  sauce kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star
0,have got to be kidding meabsolutely unable to eat any of the four dishes ordered for lunch today i read the below reviews and wondered if i was in the same placemumbles the waiter couldn't have been less help if he had stayed home todaythe broth was flavorless the noodles like a pile of jelly the fried pork was so over cooked i couldn't chew it the cold noodles were indeed cold as they tasted like they were cooked 3 days ago and stored in the fridge and the miso soup me so wished it was good as i was starving when i left
0,good: nice ambiance friendly service i was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by orenchi in the bay area that's the golden standard) walked in and saw some asian people so thought it was a good sign the bad: ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket if you haven't had good chicken karage it's fried (chicken duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional american batters) nope this was your standard frozen then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food if i wanted frozen food i would have just made it myself (no i wouldn't that shit tastes terrible) the sauce was uninspiring but hey does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it the ugly:  the ramen i ordered came out and disappointment abounds first the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket so yeah if i want supermarket food i'll just go to the supermarket am i wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch oh but it's so hard to make noodles by handmachine you say that's why i spend money in a restaurantwhat about the broth the life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together  well let's not get too excited because once again it tastes more like powdered mix are we sensing a theme here lots of supermarket stuff at a premium price sorry that's not why i go to a restaurantso why did i even bother trying this place because yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand but good at least) this was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food but i am a temporary tourist in phoenix (4 months for work normally in sf) so take my ran with a grain of salt maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob; ymmv
0,was one of the few times yelp has led us wrong came here because it was close by & had 4 stars i will say the service was perfectly fine our server was very friendly & even though it was busy we were greeted at the door & sat quickly unfortunately it was downhill from the point we got our food we ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad thai the sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &or tempura which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similarthe sushi all tasted fishy i don't think it was unfresh but it certainly didn't taste fresh either it was somewhere in between the twoif that is possible the presentation wasn't bad either but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi
0,would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service not at this location they are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything this is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistancethe organization is disjointed especially depending on your project there's even a section called "art supplies" i thought that was kind of the point of the whole store what did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames the place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them but apparently michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather so the inevitable happened and i dropped the bag now i don't expect every place to be sympathetic even though it could have been packed better but when i asked for a refund they were down right rude hey i did drop the thing but some empathy would have been nice i wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place i will never be back to this or any other michael's
0,the michaels in charlotte this one is probably the one i like the least  the store always looks terrible but that is partially due to it being an older store  the other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)  i'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other michaels in the area but it definitely lacks selection  lastly our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers  for these reasons i generally go to hobby lobby or wait until i'm on the other side of charlotte to go to a different michaels
0,have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store  today i tried going back after a year and again the staff is so unhelpful unknowledgeable and downright rude  i called to talk with the manager and her attitude is just as bad  which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff  there are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers
0,bad this is only one of two jo-ann fabrics in madison and the only one on my side of town i've shopped here 3 times a month all summer and this is what i've come to (sadly) expect:1 customer service that is apathetic at best rude at worst today for example my (sadly regular) cashier forgets twice whether i want a bag her apology "sorry i just don't care much today" no eye contact no smile this is typical of the service2 three times the last month the item price that rang up was different from that listed on the shelf i wasn't too bothered as it rang up clearance price when i mentioned to the cashier the clearance price was not the price listed on the shelf she replied "oh" and stared at me blanklyfortunately michael's craft supplies on the eastside is starting to carry more yarn and sewing items which means i can stop the tortured visits to jo-ann fabrics someday soon
0,went here to pick out fabrics for a quilt we used a few tables to pick out color schemes and see what we were working with the worker walking by actually said to us "you are going to put that away right" i was so apauled then when we went to get all the fabric cut the lady was also very unfriendly and just had poor customer service in general
0,wish that this joann's would get a management overhaul the store is always dirty the fabric is in shambles and the shelves are constantly under-stocked and unorganized i believe this is a direct management issue because the staff work hard there are just never enough of them on the flooras it has been pointed out in previous reviews there isn't competition for business on the eastside so the store continues to be in business while providing a poor environment for staff and customers clean it up guys and get some more staff you are working these ladies too hard and it's obvious that they don't have time to clean and organize the store
0,think at this point they should just close there doors on this location since the owners or manager obviously don't care they have excellent products that you cant get anywhere else but they almost never have enough staff i have gone there on over 8 separate occations and left without the merchandise i had picked out because there was no one on the registers at all or because there was only 1 person on register and huge line of people waiting a store is pretty much worthless if you cant pay for the items i dont steal but i would imagine they loose a lot of stuff from people waiting for a checker too long
0,customer service  asked for help and was told to go wait in a line next that girl couldn't find the item that was kept behind counter didn't want to spend time on me because of people behind me other customer asked if she could call for backup  manager standing around said in a minute  continued doing nothing i won't return to this location
0,used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover after paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars why would anyone come on sunday if they're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice
0,give it 0 stars if i could getto place with workers that don't give a damn about customer service never will go here or recommend to anyone that they waste any money on this place
0,hole  too bad 0 stars is not an option here  the staff and management are rude and only want money  someone sprayed pepper spray and sent multiple patrons to the er and the staff just sat there like they could care less  save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet  this place is so ghetto and trashy  all the money they make from $30 admissions and it still looks the same as it did in 1974  disgrace to the gay community
0,place epitomizes the gaff between gay and lesbian culture if you have a penis don't expect to be treated like an equal even if you're not competition what you should expect are a bunch of glares as soon as you walk through the door the staff will tolerate you but won't be friendly no less than 5 people will cut you because after all this is their turf and you don't belong theredon't sit at a table because "this table is taken" even if there's no one sitting there and their aren't any beverages on iti won't be going back
0,place charges a cover charge we should be paid to come in there it's in a horrible place in town drinks or retardedly over priced & the parking is ridiculous the inside of the club only smells more worse then the urinal because the little tiny room they call a bathroom is 2x2 you can't pay me to come back there i wish i had known how horrible this place was before i got suckered into going & basically throwing away my money
0,far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me i know gay nightclubs lol no seriously this place is crap i have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and it's no fun the drag show is lame or the acts i have seen are the dj is good plays some different tunes the ac is non existent i think they use a swamp cooler the bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal the drinks are expensive watered down and even the soda tasted funny the bar tender was very nice and friendly never tried the food outside but i hear it's great the parking is another disaster there is limited space and the night we went there was a few break ins in the back parking lot near liquor store just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club give it a shot at your own risk but remember i warned you
0,here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) fenyxcruisin had everything i would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere cheap drinks a stage friendly bartenders and trannies crossdressers and drag queens as far as the eye could see for a moment i felt how robert smith must feel whenever he walks into a hot topic or hulk hogan in a bandana wholesaler's but alas like torrid and guitar center i inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all timewhile waiting for the show to commence fenyx and i went through the back door to take a smoke break as were a lot of other people the back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side so he and i are just standing around smoking talking making sure nobody shuts the door and out comes the dj he steps out and before even lighting his cigarette slams the door behind him"awwww man now you've locked us out" we say playfullythe dj stands over fenyx eyeballing him as he responds with "yeah that's the point to keep the undesirables out" before walking off with his cigarette"what the hell just happened" i ask"he thinks we're a straight couple" i laughed i searched for a pen i'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past but this was the first time i'd been mistaken as straight this had to be documented fenyx who is also not straight was not as amusedi tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside where the dj proceeded to stare down my amigo and i from across the bar i knew at any moment a confrontation would escalate and i was forced to choose between leaving early missing the drag show or watch the tension rise to eruption one of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail so naturally i opted we go back to the bunkhouse and play dartsi'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty but uh so is what they did so it works out i guessoh well torrid and guitar center seem to do just fine without my business i'm sure cruisin 7th will do just fine
0,an absolute dive and not in a good way the day i was so lucky to have gone there was a show of some kind with twinks bouncing all around on the stage with small briefs on not attractive at all  now when entering it be prepared it reaks of bo sewer and garbage i had to push my way through just to get past the entrance once standing there trying to get my surrounding's i'm pushed and bumped into as if i am not there i cannot stand packed places especially with shirtless sweaty smelly guys rubbing into meyuck i be-lined it for the patio for escape and stayed there until my friends were ready to leave just a awkward mix of very "interesting "people not the most nice to look at or trust to leave your drink for any amount of time it's definitely not worth the olfactory assault to ever go in there again
0,there is lots of fun to be had here- the atmosphere of the show does not make up for the lack of cleanliness and overall "ick" factor  i love me some dive bars but this one was a little too subterranean  that and please ladies- when you are lip syncing at least know half of the words to the song  just moving your mouth and jaw like an automaton is not fun or attractive
0,went here once for a drag king contest all the women were very over weight and not very entertaining the bar itself is the size of a shack and it is definetly for an older male crowdif you are a lesbian between the ages of 21-35 this is not your spot
0,again a few years back i was treated with horrible service we approached the owner about it and he treated us like crap too boycotted this bar for 2 years and tried it again once again they prove to be a-holes there are plenty of friendly bars that will appreciate the business
0,upset at this place  i'm outside in the beer garden having a cigarette when the owner came up to me and said that i smell pot on my person i told him that i was a medical patient and that i medicated before i got to the bar  he told me not to smoke in the parking lot  i told him i haven't  that i know the laws then he accused me of smoking in the parking lot  i really feel discriminated here and i will not come back  even when u respect their rules they feel they can just discriminate u and call u out in front of everyone definitely will not be coming back
0,was a fun experience until i checked my bank account and find the erroneously overcharged me over $3500 when i called they tried to tell me it was a debit "hold" for tip it was not this was a week later and the charge went through they said they would have someone call me back they did not i got the run around and they gave themselves a very generous tip at my expense have fun but check your bank account they don't play by the rules
0,was raised catholic (but no longer practice) and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so i was really looking forward to our tour of st anthony's beware: i can't speak for their other guides but the gentleman (a lay person not a priest) who "led" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of true believers the infallibility of the catholic faith and whether we'd all found our "charisms" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints too--than showing us any relics after an hour of his sermon--and nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded us--we left what a disappointment what a huckster
0,you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book  they have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can dounfortunately i see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to "preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion"  meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices  if churches like this one wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all not just the people hired by the couple to be there
0,made by men check them before you book this church to get married or any other event their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side stay away from this church
0,place is less than honest we turned up on a saturday evening at 7 pm  we were the only customer afterwards there were three more when we left we ordered the dish "meat lover" for the hungry  at 3995- which was supposed to include prime rib eye kobe chuck and kobe rib eye" to our surprise a waiter came up silently with a plate that has one row of meat  undistinguished of any kind kobe or not it all looks alike   next it was worse when we tasted it it was less than fresh and for a hungry meat lover it was a real bad experience that mad us run away we then tried to stop by monday at lunch time to make our complaint the manager duly took note and said he would review the camera in the kitchen and contact us alas we never heard of him again so we assumed the the camera did not lie
0,far every restaurant i've tried in this plaza (just two lol) have not been that great the restaurant was completely empty at 12 pmonly one waitress working and a couple customers went into the restaurant after us and she seemed quite frantic took a while for the fooda tiny plate of veggies with broth that tasted weird ponzu sauce had a strange taste to it meat still looked frozen and was not great at allmiso had a weird sour taste overall i didn't like it sesame sauce was good but i probably won't come here again
0,i was in vegas for edc weekend one of my friend suggest us to try the shabu restaurant he had stated thats the only time he will ever eat shabu since he's not a big of a fan of shabu as i am so as we get there i was like okay there's cars so were going to have to wait as soon as i walked in there was only one couple in there *awkward cricket noise* i could've sworn this restaurant was super good and worth it by what my friend had said anywho walked in sat down i was excited to try the ponzu & goma sauce the prices for the meat was decent but what i didn't like about it was that it did not taste fresh the meat tasted & looked like it was bought from a grocery place and then they just placed it really quick onto the plate and made it look nice the goma sauce was so sweet and the texture of it sucked i tried to add in as much items as i can to take the sweetness away seemed like they bought that from a grocery store also the ponzu was okay not bad thats probably the best thing there  as i got down to making my soup i asked the waitress for soup base but guess what nope they dont have soup base what the f   seriously she didnt even supply us with the right tools to get our noodles with [thats no big deal cause either way i know how to use chopsticks] but when she brought us our bowls that just made me not want to be there anymore these bowls they brought to us are the bowls that is the smallest one how the hell are you suppose to enjoy your udon in that small ass bowl really  i was just glad to leave  never again will i go to the shabu in vegasif you want real shabu that will definitely not disappoint you if you're in orange county eat at shabu bar i guarantee you will not be disappointed  in the service drinks food & the awesome workers there
0,shabu in vegasyes please  i was in the mood for shabu while in vegas and came upon this location based on the great reviewsthose giving this place high marks are outta their minds and havn't eaten at a true shabu place  nothing to rave about here place was empty i should have knownthinking of eating shabu in vegas skip this locationoh korean garlic chicken your better off eating chicken nuggets at mcdonald's
0,am not quite sure what is wrong with all the people on this site giving this restaurant high marks i went based upon those and was extremely disappointed  this was by far and away one of the worst meals i have had in recent memory the majority of my party felt ill afterwards i would give it 0 stars but yelp doesn't allow that
0,love shabu shabu and have been going to the shabu shabu in henderson (i won't name to be fair) for a long time we decided to try this place swish to get something a little different in the end we were extremely disappointed and wish we could recommend it but just can not decor and ambiance are ok waitress was nice peach tea was good prices fairthe major problem was the food we ordered chicken and beef with shabu shabu and sukiyaki firstly the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored secondly the chicken was in chunks not sliced and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits the chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick the chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked i just couldn't eat the chicken at all my companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it but he didn't like it either the beef was ok and sliced appropriately and i ate that in the shabu shabu but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing i like cabbage but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodlesthe minor problem was the hot pots they were extremely shallow and the waitress didn't pay attention to them so they were constantly boiling down and at multiple points were down to almost nothing so we couldn't cook our foodi left hungry and sad
0,was not impressed i have to agree with the 1 or 2 star review where someone said whoever is giving this place good ratings has not had real shabu shabuthe place was plain the first thing i noticed when we sat down was that they had condiment settings that are normally used for things like chili sauce filled with what looked like grated ginger or garlic scallions and onions i said to my boyfriend that these could've been sitting out all day i glanced at a table to the left of the bar and there were a bunch of these condiment sets sitting there probably never used since they took 'em out of the fridge because no one comes here (it was pretty dead) hmmnext i was looking at their menu and i was fairly disappointed everything just seemed to cost so much more than it should've when the waitress came to take our order my boyfriend told her what we wanted but she turned to me and asked what i wanted my boyfriend was like "we're going to share" i started to wonder if the portions were supposed to be for each person if so then i felt like everything was overpriced when we got the food we were able to share it just fine (though my boyfriend ate most of it and i am hungry now a few hours later) at the end of the meal i still felt like we overpaid our meal was $23 if we hadn't split what the waitress implied was supposed to be a meal for a single person then it would've been too much imo we just had hot pot at this great place in rowland heights ca (called kingswood teppan steak house if you're ever in the area) and we had way more food and broth (two kinds too) for $32 we had two different kinds of broth four ingredients (chicken beef mushrooms vegetables) and there was fried rice for each of us since it seems we split a single meal we only got one bowl of white rice the $9 difference would've only gotten us i think probably just the side of chicken (it was like $695 or something) and we would have a couple bucks leftover that wouldn't have paid for anything else i wasn't happy with the pricesas i mentioned before it was pretty dead when we got there after finishing our meal and reading the reviews i was not surprised i've had hot pot before but this is my first time having it in las vegas i'm hoping better places exist i may just have to start having hot pot at home when i get cravingsi can't recommend this place nor do i ever plan on coming back
0,got pumped up by all the hype when i first heard of the new craze that is shabu shabu  to all the fans i'm sorry to say but i think swish shabu shabu was a fail  swish did not live up to all its swash  we ordered numerous items on the menu from small portions of seafood and the kobe  the amount of food that you get for the price was not worth it  also am i the only one here that thinks the broth especially the sukiyaki was bland to the bone  we dumped in a dribble of soy sauce gave it a few shakes of pepper stirred up some magic juju in hopes to re-engineer the flavor buy no luck there  the whole dining experience as a first timer was an ultimate downer  i didn't finish first with this one i guess i'm just not a shabu kinda' guy
0,happened to this place it used to be so good i opted for the prime chuck and it was so thick tough and chewy their beef used to be really goodservice was not great never checked up on me as i didn't have enough water to finish cooking my beef sadly disappointed
0,when paying w a credit card they will add a tip to you on the iphone and show you just a signing screen sometimes they will even sign for it themselves happened to multiple people if you're willing to come here even despite this review please pay w cash or check with extreme caution of what they're trying to charge you they will email you a receipt so that that will give them adequate time to get away with it and deny assistance when you try to dispute itservice: the service is poor inconsistent they forgot our order didn't pay any attention to what was being requested and ignored everybody us for the most part we got our food late the vegetables early the meat at least 30 mins later (my friend got their meat 45 mins later) the meat was even the expensive stuff was less than mediocre atmosphere: the place had an odor to it that would make you sick after sitting in it for a while it should have been a sign when you go into a shabu shabu house and you see the only clientele there to be over weight non-asian people not to say that you need to be a skinny asian to enjoy shabu shabu but every good shabu shabu place i ever seen had a bunch of skinny asian people in itconclusion: do not come here if you do anyways make sure they dont over charge you for service they did not do
0,i known this was an ayce only place i would not have went there  it started off good the menu and rules were explained we were showed how to tableside cook some items  i don't eat very much food and quite frankly the only think i actually enjoyed was their lemonade  my wife placed an order of dishes that would be prepared in the kitchen  the first item as an eggplant dish  it never arrived and we kept asking for it and some lamb chops  we were presented with our bill instead  finally 1 lamb chop arrived and we still had to ask again for the eggplant dish  when the eggplant dish finally arrived it had the most nasty old grease smell that i almost lost my dinner from the smell  my wife took one bite and passed  we tipped our standard $1 for bad service on our $50 meal  oh yea that ayce price might be less than $20 but it does not include drinks  at least i got a refill of the lemonade the only thing i enjoyed  if you like ayce places this might be your thing  my wife liked the lamb chop (i was way full before it finally arrived) but the focus of this place is to cook it yourself and get you out the door as fast as you can
0,this place is a place i wish i had never tried tried this when they first opened with a friend of mine from out of town meat quality was subpar esp for the price of the place i cannot see how this place has as many stars as it does my guess is that they have not been to a quality shabu spot i bet i can go to a better place and pay about the same amount with meat that is way better than here i've been around a lot of butchered meat and the meat here is not good i wouldn't even try their pork or chicken here by looking at their quality of beef
0,only giving this place a 1-star because there is no zero-star option the whole place is a disorganized mess it's riddled with building code and health code violations for example they have camping stoves on the tables but no exhaust hoods to ventilate the room they have exposed outlets the place is a wreck the food was decent but stay away from the blue crab unless you bring your own claw crackers they don't have them no one comes to bus your table the one point they left a bussers tub on the floor by our table which we used to dispose of our used dishes oh and if you order appetizers be sure to savor them an hour into your meal that is
0,our first visit here was the best the server was helpful and explained how to work the hot pot they had showed us how to make different sauces and flavors for the broth now the second go around our server didn't explain the new menu nor did he know what an arnold palmer was he only explained that he was having a bad day since the chargers lost he seems lost and unsure of the menu then said we had the option to do the lunch or dinner menu stating lunch menu did not include appetizers and the dinner menu includes 4 appetizers each we wanted to do lunch because we only wanted two appetizers he said ok then a moment later came back and said we could only do the dinner option he rarely check on us and looked high totally upset that we wasted $40 on broth that tasted bland and possibly old the high light of our mealmy water the appetizers were actually better then i expected they were the 2nd highlight of our meal maybe we just got a bad server whatever the case not satisfied should have went to yama sushi like we planned
0,was extremely disappointed with this restaurant my friend told me about it i got there and this guy who seemed like he did not what he was doing helped me told him it was my first time  he was so busy and did not explain anything i was so hungry so i proceeded to get food there was a fridge with all this shabu ingredients  it was ok the bad part was it was supposed to be all you eat  but then they gave me a menu that said you could only order 4 items i was surprised but i looked at the pictures and saw cute little appetizer things i ordered  4 items when it came i was really shocked the things that came did not resemble the pictures and instead of three pieces i got two pieces   please if you are providing visual references  please make it similar to what you are going to give me so i could at least  identify what i ordered i was so frustrated now because i waited for a long time for my orders it was hailing a taxi cab  in new york you have to chase the servers so i never got to see my waiters it was always someone new people were waiting to pay and it was taking a long time well i said i am just  going to have dessert i heard of the mango and sticky rice in a lot of the reviews and i was excited  because it was the only thing i could look forward for at this point guess what  when i asked about it the waitress told me my only choices were green tea ice cream and another thing that i didn't even understandim sorry but that was it i paid and let and went to another place to get my dessert  i am not coming back
0,terrible the only good about this place is the decor the food was horrible the chicken was rubbery the veggies were a joke my wife and i only ate the fried rice paid our bill and then went to sushi mon don't go here you will be very disappointed
0,you kidding me worst dining experience ever i had high expectations for this place first off the hostess was rude she asked if we had been there before but took awhile for her to explain how everything is self-served (which by the way was disgusting how all the meat and seafood is just openly exposed in the same nasty refrigerator for who knows how long) the plates were dirty and some of the meat we chose from the fridge was literally sticking onto the plate no one even asked if we wanted anything to drink we had to get up ask for water it took 25 minutes to get our appetizers and the quality of the food was just horrible i had spit out the clams because it tasted old and bad i feel like i'm about to get sick i left unhappy unsatisfied and still hungry
0,time coming here and my last time the service sucked big time very little instructions on where anything is the food area looks like a health code violation the plates and sliverware still had left over food  overall this place seems like its been open for years and everything is grimy and gross the broth has no flavor taste like boiling water was it worth the 2200 nope will i come back nope i am afraid i might get food poisoning
0,beware  apparently the lunch ayce price does not apply on the weekends  went to lunch there today and assumed the weekday lunch price nowhere in the restaurant nor did our host notify us the price on the weekends were the dinner price  imagine my surprise when i got the check  i asked the host where does it say dinner price on weekends  she feigned not being able to understand english all of the sudden and said it's a new thing they just enacted  really  will not be returning here again
0,tried to eat here twice for their advertised lunch special  went on a sunday as banner outside did not specify days told it was sunday brumch only tried again and even called to make sure they were offering the lunch special on a saturday and was told yes on the phone drove 15 mins out our way and are told when we walk in that there is no lunch special given line of excuses that person was new that had answered phone no "we will honor what our employee said" line or offer to get manager plus the chalkboard with lunch specials is out on display next to counter inside even will not waste my time with this place again due to constant bad employee communicationcustomer service
0,went today at 5pm and there was no indication that it was closed as the sign said open on tues-sun until 10:30pm i came in with a group of 4 others and one man greeted us and asked us how big was our party we replied 5 and he said he was "the only worker there" and "we were too big for him" he looked extremely confused as to why we showed up and the rest of the place was empty he didn't explain to us if there were workers that were supposed to show up or if we would expect abnormally long wait times or if today was an anomaly because of the snow he basically just turned us away we wanted hotpot so it literally requires him to turn on a burner and slice meat he doesn't even have to cook what is the point of leaving the restaurant open or even running a restaurant if you don't adhere to your hours of opening genuinely confused at how and when to eat at this place
0,never give 1 star before but this time we wait here for over 30 minutes to get our hot pot when we finally got it so disappointing the hot pot is really really has no flavor it tastes like nothing even we order a spicy flavor so does the bbq and it wait so long we just decided move to another restaurant
0,for long time and the taste not worth the waiting at all price set high i think i will not go back
0,tried two hot pots obviously this place tries to copy "boiling point" but it is absolutely a failure the seafood pot has no flavors it is a long wait for the food to come and then for the pot to boil with such a small firebesides it is too expensive for so little food i will never go back
0,service ever went here for a family dinner and waited more than 30 minutes for our food which didn't come all at once we were told that rice came with our entrees but the rice never came after 10 more minutes i asked about the rice and they said they had to cook more at this point everyone in the whole restaurant (small place) had been eating for 20 minutes with no new orders it was apparent that they forgot to make more (hard to imagine in an asian restaurant) i did ask how this was possible and was told they gave it to the carryout order that just happened (we were here first) i have now been waiting for an hour as i decided to type this review for an awful dinner the candle in our hot pot has already burned out while waiting unbelievable
0,small place  we had 8 of us thank goodness we had a reservation but the food took so long:  from appetizers to our actually meals they forgot a lot  our drinks were also empty  the servers are hit and miss:  1 server was helpful and 1 server was not happy to be there  it was like we were bothering her
0,was soo damn excited to try this place being really close by and being raised on authentic chinesehong kong hot pot in la and hi i read all the reviews got excited and went :( i hate to give low scores but this is based off of my total experince they get one less star because of lack of correct business information posted here as far as business hours and bbq hours they also seriously need a website this is an aweful business practice and they could be making some serious improvements businesses need to be on top of these basic and fundamental things wthwell fist off on yelp it says they are open at 11am nope when i arrived excitedly sign says 5-2am ok no prob ill come backnext day i go back yayyy upon entering i am bombarded by loud and obnoxious techno that keeps reapeating itself other than that the decor was cute and as everyone described here the techno music put me on edge lol i could not relax to enjoy my experience with a few tables filled did the music need to be so loudon to the menu and servicewe had originally come to try this famous rice ball everyones been talking about and possibly get some little vegetarian bbq sides similar to yakitori when i mentioned the word "yakitori" the waitress dressed in japanese garb was like "what u say" ok right this is chinese owned chinesehong kong restaurant she was nice she priceeds to tell me that the bbq menu is only avail thurs - sat what you guys seriously need to update your yelp info i already missed eating here once cause your hours are posted wrong and now i sat there unable to try what i came here for :(in my observation service was not very efficient or quick service was slow as i observed in general it was not busy so i couldint understand why our server was not more attendantwe had ordered a sake bomb to share and no second cup was brought out had to askthe food itself was great i always order vegetarian things so i was happy there were an item here and there was i had a terrific eggplant dish that itself deserves 5 stars we also shared the tomato vegetarian hot pot lighter in flavor than others i've had in my life it was still yummy it said there was supposed to be lotus root in there when i told my server there was none she was like "oh really sorry" nothing to correct the situation we shared it its made for one and it comes with a choice of two dipping sauces they sucked see in la you get all these sauces at the table for free and they are authentic and damn good i could tell they americanized the dipping sauces here :(over all slightly dissaponted and just wish az had a really bomb and authentic hot pot experience hong kong hot pot that im used to feeds four cause the pots so damn huge and its like $15-$20 for one pot here its $10 + :(we were finished with our meal for a good 10 min and began to gather our things before she noticed to give us our check where did our free ice cream go that everyone was raving about we did not get any :(i see where everyones been confused about this place its japanese decored but hong kong style food maybe they should consider changing the theme to stop the confusion loli will give it a try again just to get my asian food fix nearby but i hope for better dining experiences
0,disappointedi had my usual dirty martini but a friend wanted just a soda since she was drivingdo you know what they charged$400  for a soda  and it was in the smallest glass  come onwith dui laws that we have here in scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in  $400 for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at target to get a case  ($350) i am not cheap by any stretch but i think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda  don't go to stone rose if you are looking for a drink deal
0,call is a 1130pm  fail  the bourbon steak bar is awesome cuz there is nobody in it  fat people are loners
0,have a gluten free menu but beware i got horribly glutened here and was unable to eat for at least 48 hours after this meal if you are a coeliac or very gluten sensitive do not eat here this was the worst "gluten free" restaurant experience in over 4 years of being on a gf diet and it ruined part of my business trip to the uki expect it will take at least a week to recover from this
0,cant begin to describe how much i hate this placepretty much its full of people who think money is everything bitching on about others and drinking cocktails that cost more than the extortionate entry fee grrthe student nights arent too bad if you catch it on a good week - but most of the time it's just hammered first years and on all the other nights its odd business men trying to get with the younger girls not goodthe bar is self is a bit crap - its atmosphere is like walking in on your parents doing it has no charm but attempts to cover these major flaws with tacky bling and various other furnishingsavoid if you value your morals
0,for one well rum & coke not including tipi don't freaking think so ever again plus i had to send my boyfriend to get me my drink since no one ever came to our table ever oh wait i take that back the cocktail server did stop by to say where closing now
0,was not happy one bit here  earlier that night my girlfriend and i were waiting to meet up with a mutual friend at the palazzo  we first went to the zebra lounge for a while to wait but the lounge was closing and one the hosts said that since they were closing they recommended the laguna  we went and only found one table open which that empty glasses from who ever was sitting there before  we sat down and stayed there until sometime past 2am (when the lights went on and the music stopped) and still those glasses were still there  i think were were here for at least a good hour and none of the waitress ever stopped by to ask for a drink  i went to the bar as there were 3 bartenders one was serving drinks the other cleaning some glasses and the last one i have no idea what was doingi walked to the first guy and as soon as i approached the bar he walked to the other side and i just there for a few minutes looking like an idiot  i then walked to the other end and he walked backno i looked like a bigger idiot as he was just cleaning glasses  the lady in the back walked away so there were only 2 of them now  as i walked to the other bartender there he was serving about 10 drinks for a group of ladies that were there and then a gentleman who was ordering a drink for him self and a buddy of his  10 minutes later i finally order one drink (rum & coke) and the damage was $15 which anywhere else in vagas would be about $5 (and if that was not bad enoughi still left a tip)  i finally came back to our table and those glasses from the previous customers were still there  my girlfriend asked "what took so long" as she though i just left her therei don't see myself going back here again
0,of bars charging more than the billthis is the 2nd time this has happened in this property i know its the strip and am willing to pay extra for drinks so when i ordered 4 jameson gingers and it came out to 60 bucks i had no issues however sorry im standing at a bar and it took you 30 seconds to pour the 4 drinks im not going to tip 20% i signed the check and left a 5 dollar tip (i usually tip a dollar per drink at a bar) and today i see a charge on my debit card for 72 dollars first time this happened was at a bar by the pool a few months ago take pictures of the check you signed people because they are dishonest at the palazzo
0,the worst bar in las vegas i'm a regular guest at the hotel and have never experienced such rude service carrsten is not only incredibly arrogant but also implied that i looked like a hooker because i was alone please understand that i was in a knee length black dress without cleavage or skin tight material i only tried to make polite conversation because i'd met so many great people on this trip i never knew being a single successful woman who can pay for things herself was so offensive none of the staff are friendly so i guess he fits right in
0,thumbs down it's places like this that give scottsdale a bad name  i must divulge that i'm not basing this rating on an actual review of the club because they never let me and my friend in the door man readily let all of our female friends in and stopped us the men in my group were a minority two men with six ladies the ladies in the front of our group entered with their momentum and the last two stayed with us a steady stream of flesh baring ladies entered one after the other beside us we explained that we were with a group (admittedly trying to work the fact that we were with women to our advantage) and the velvet rope boy demeaningly stated that "every guy out here is with 'lots of women'" i never want to use my girlfriends as currencywe went next door all of our girlfriends left narcisse and joined us and i'll never go backugh totally gross i just moved to town and this place appears to epitomise all of the materialistic things about which i'd been forewarned regarding snottsdalewhat do you expect with a bar called "narcisse"i'll add: in the 12 hr or so my girlfriends were in the bar two of them were groped by "manthers" referred to in connie's post belowhave funincidentally being new to town i am looking for pubsclubs in greater scottsdale and phoenix where humans can go with their friends suggestions
0,service staff needs more training there's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i don't think this place is going to make it sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons saturday night because of your poor customer service
0,i could ever put a rating of no stars i would gladly do so for this establishment i agree with jared t below this place definitely gives his town a bad name this pseudo-la ish & wanna be establishment is just another copy of what they hope to be bringing in celebrities mr jerkoff bouncer that ain't gonna work their front door staff really needs to get their heads out of their asses even the vegas nightclubs rarely stoop down to their level especially on a non-holiday & rainy weekend they're still weeding people out seriously hahaha good luck with your short-run success mr owneri'm actually not bitter i just feel sad that such establishments in scottsdale still haven't completely opened up to reality i laugh at you lol i'm sure there are good folks in scottsdale but from what my friends have encountered it just seems to me that discrimination is still alive and thriving under a cloak of modernism if you're not from this town just beware of the front door staff that'll come greeting you with discrimination with open arms unless you're a promiscuous blonde girl lol
0,place sounded awesome and i am always up for champagne unfortunately i have absolutely nothing to base this review off of my husband & i stopped in today after some shopping around 4 pm there was only 3 other parties there the hostess sat us on the patio we were super excited to try some different champagnes and the weather was just perfect we waited for 10 minutes and nobody ever came over to our table we waited ten more minutes and still nobody we decided to get up and leave and on our way out absolutely nobody said anything to us so needless to say we won't be back and i have absolutely no idea how the drinks food or service is (besides completely non existent) :(
0,have never been treated so rudely as i was at narcisse  but let me start from the beginning  my husband and i went there for drinks after dinner on saturday night and at first i was shocked that they made everyone wait in line when there was clearly plenty of room inside  secondly it was odd that there were two young children around age 7 or 8 working the door along side the doormen  i assume they are the owners kids and they were adorable kids but the last thing i want to see at a barloungenightclub on a saturday night are children  but i can get over that- no big deal  once inside i ordered one of the least expensive glasses of champagne for $10 and  i noticed later on the receipt that they charged me double for  again i can get over that  my husband and i were enjoying our night and before leaving we decided to check the patio out and walked out the side door and walked towards the entranceexit so we could leave  as we were making our way to the exit some guy came up to me said 'this is a private party' and i had no idea why he was saying that to me- the first thing that entered my mind was 'why are you telling me that'  then he went on to say 'this is a private party and you are going to have to leave'  um what there were no sighs or anything at all that indicated we were suddenly in a 'private' area  we were 5 feet from the door  as we were leaving the doorman asked us if we had a good time and we said as a matter of fact we were quite offended that as were were simply walking around and heading to the door another patron took it upon himself to tell us to leave  i suggested that if an area is designated as a private party that they should have it marked as such  he said he agreed that it was very rude and that i needed to tell his boss who was 2 feet away  so i repeated myself to who i assume is the 'head bouncer' and his response was 'well maybe you two should leave'  what i couldn't believe the words that were coming out of his mouth  he clearly doesn't have a clue about customer service  and from reading the other reviews i am certainly not the only person that was treated this way  terrible service
0,place sucks  it's really that simple  the build out is decent but the staff and bouncers are rude  someone needs to tell them they are in north scottsdale not la  i give it until the summer begins before they are out of business  sorry but it's no tea party
0,horrible horrible  9 ladies for a birthday lunch 35 minutes passed before the wine we ordered was delivered another 30 to 45 minutes before our order was taken and then at least 45 minutes before our entrees were brought out one plate at a time  the owner () came by to address our concerns and had one excuse after another as to why things went wrong  when i told him numerous calls to reserve a table went unanswered (calls went directly to a voice message saying they were open for lunch and dinner) he said "we have a digital system didn't you get directed to prompts" (even if i did get said prompts who wants to make a reservation for a simple lunch the same way you are trying to have a conversation with your credit card company)  i said no all i got was a dial tone   i then told him  their website directed me to opentablecom to make a reservation i went to opentable only to get a message narcisse is no longer a member  the owners response  "our problem with opentable is that we are a nightclub"  what in the world does that mean  if you are a nightclub be a nightclub-do not tout yourself as a lunchdinner restaurant  we are an easy going group of women age 40 to 60 who meet once a month for lunch price is never an issue and we never ever do the dreaded separate check thing so rarely have issues but this outing was absolutely the worst experience we have ever had individually or collectively
0,can't hear yourself think in this place never mind talk to and hear another person it's a meat market if ever there was one wall-to-wall people even getting a beer is a herculean task if you're looking to meet an interesting sophisticated woman then look elsewhere the crowd is definitely for those in their 20s it's full of those women who grew up with paris hilton and britney spears as role models and adore lady gaga i recommend mabel's if you want an opportunity to meet a beauty with brains to match
0,there on a saturday night at 11:00 pm nobody in line waited for 10 minutes (still first in line) and asked the bouncer what is going on and why we can't we get in ----- you have to wait  i'm ready to get in have a drink and have fun wait for what the place is half empty ---- ohhh i know but you have to wait me: this is retarded i'm never coming back the end
0,wasn't that great and the "bouncer" had a real attitude with people it was my birthday weekend and i thought this place would be a cool place to have it yeahnot so much i was really disappointed with his customer service and peoples attitudes it was suppose to be a cheery event so we went to prime bar and salt turned out to be a great night after we left this place
0,douche bags at the gates were rude and asking for money to let us get in there are better places that this  no thanks 
0,guys that they have working the front were jerks i went to meet up with friends for table service and the jerks at the front would not let me in they wouldn't even talk to me to let them know that i was paying for bottle service i waited for 30 minutes and took my money somewhere else this place is a joke if it wants to maintain the reputation that they are putting out there the they need to get organized with the lines in front hire better bouncers who are not jerks and not to turn away or make people wait for 30 minutes who are paying for bottles i will not be back this place will crash soon i'm not the only one many of my friends have had the same  results  and will not be waisting there time eitherpeople don't waist your timeoh and i'm not a lame unattractive douche bag either i'm a hot 24 year old educated women  believe me when i do bottle service this weekend for my 25th bday it won't be at "the mint"
0,and foremost where's the dance floor service was pretty fast with getting me drinks but the quality of the drinks was terrible vodka cranberry tasted like something with cranberry syrup and the bartender gave me an attitude about how it's not his fault so it must be minepacked with zombies in dress-code uniform and a long line revolver would have been a much better idea and it doesn't have a cover
0,fail: no malibu busted second fail: not being able to use the empty parking lot on a wednesday afternoon without valet parking really valet parking is used so you don't have to park a million blocks away and you pay for the convenience of having someone go run after it not so you can rape patrons by having them pay $8 to get out the car drive 10 feet and park itthird fail: bartenders these days in scottsdale where do they come from my friend ordered a dirty martini and he didn't know what that was mon dieu the mint and i really can't stand metro-phoenix establishments ripping off classic la names and trying to charge la prices trying to exude the hipsteriness *my word*  is a clusterf-ck of proportions overall not impressed and won't return
0,a 1 only because you can't give zeros in a city known for its pretentiousness mint tries very hard at being the most pretentious and it's the one thing it does well  we've been there twice now  the first time we had a good time but that was more due to the company than the place  the food is well below average  as long as you are having a drink make sure it's wine or beer since their mixed drinks are among the worst we've ever had  the staff is the ultimate in snobbery  pass
0,unfortunate looking waitresses checkextremely overpriced drinks checkno room to dance in a "dance club checkmusic that just flat out sucks check a venue that will falsely accuse you of stealing glow in the dark condoms checkbouncers that really really wish they could be policemen and make sure to act like they think they are checkbroken glass decorating the floors waiting to be stepped on checkvip tables that cost more than vegas check lying management that wishes they were working in hollywood checka nightclub that's not worth your money your time or your recommendation checkif you want all of this and more go to the mint in scottsdale  it claims to be everything trendy chill and that you want in a nightclub and if all of the above sounds trendy and chill to you this is your placemy 20 friends and i between the ages of 22 and 30 had a horrible time at this club and will never consider going back  as a young adult who has seen her share of bars and nightclubs across the west coast this was my worst experience ever and this is a place i vow to never return to
0,i heard bad boy bill was coming to the mint in february i was ecstatic problem is this place has no dance floor how do you invite one of the all-time great djs to a place without a dance-floor just plain stupid management has explicitly said on yelp they are "not a club" and i can understand that but they should probably just stick to the regular top 40 if they don't have a dance-floor in my opinion just a bad look on their part i will be driving to vegas for xs to have a real party to which the mint cannot supply nor do i plan to give the mint a fourth try they lose my business
0,past weekend i went to the mint for their 24k brunch which is supposed to be amazing  unfortunately i didn't even get the chance to try it  i walked in with 2 friends and was not even acknowledged by the hostess  we had to ask for a menu and were rudely handed them  we asked for a table and she said to seat ourselves so we did  we were promptly given waters by who i believe was a buser  we asked to order drinks and he said our server would be right with us  after 30 minutes we gave up and left our server never came  we asked multiple people where they were and the answer was always that they would be right there i was appalled that this happened  i was looking forward to testing this brunch out  service is important and the mint has terrible service
0,a resident of scottsdale i try to give all local restaurants & bars a chance i was incredibly disappointed with the mint's menu prices and items we ordered their sizzled shrimp (7 to be exact) which soaked in a dish of sauce this dish could have been much better had they added rice to this twelve dollar item which would probably cost them little to nothing to add instead you have to pay for a tiny side of rice the sliders were an asian slider which was soaked in a rice bun the meat on this "slider" was full of gristle and had tons of lettuce last we were still starving so we ordered dessert lol - let me tell you we ordered their goat cheese wonton when they say "wonton" they mean one the wonton was the size of a quarter and that was it if this place wants to strive during the week they need to add a great hh menu and put more food on their dishes a huge disappointment
0,disappointingwannabe heavenoverpriced  bunch of kids running the place i wonder what it will be called next year after this one fails
0,not ever go to this club worst club i've ever been to the girls there are hideous and fat there is a dancer there named suzy q that smells so bad she left the stench of stinky underarm on the sleeve of my shirt when she sat down on me i almost bought the deodorant out of the vending machine to give to her most all of the girls are very unfriendly and lazy they have great drink specials but that is the only good thing about that club but i wouldn't recommend this club to my worst ememy
0,the owner i know your reviews have not been very good so here is what i am suggesting give me a free lap dances( as long as it is not suzy q) and i will write you a great review and i agree since i have only spent a half hour in your establishment
0,was excited to see that a "champagne lounge" would be the newest addition to market square's continuing revitalization champagne on tap who knew unfortunately perle falls flat on its face in almost every regard the decor is well trashy it's all black upholstered couches and recessed multi-colored led lights a la frat boy with an interior design budget i was unaware that the prevailing aesthetic of the center of downtown pittsburgh is trending towards bridge and tunnel coke den come on perle we're better than that perle also seems to think that it's possible to cram a "nightclub" "restaurant" and "lounge" into the same relatively small space it doesn't work they should have stopped with the menu and fancy drinks and not continued to the obnoxiously loud music emanating i kid you not from a kid with a macbook and an accompanying saxophonist "playing' what can only be described as 1991-inspired acid jazz gross finally there was an entourage of what looked to be the ownermanager the night i visited making it feel like the place is an extension of someone's living room and not in a good way in a clubby way of course i realize that my opinion may be in the minority as there are likely throngs of cranberrians and wexfordites who will be thrilled at the prospect of a "real night out" in tahn knock yourselves out i'll happily be steering well clear
0,not be back had two champagne cocktails which were very mediocre the type of champagne wasn't even listed on the menu - cant imagine it was anything worthwhile what tipped me off at first to the atmosphere was the carpetted steps going to the bar more carpet at the space at the front of the bar moving in the group of 5 i was with found ourselves standing in the middle of what may possibly been intended as a dance floor - this was at aboun10 pm - but no one was dancing so it was awkward there were no tables to set your drinks on but all that aside - i would have been ok with the place except for this - the worst part - the crowd 35+ bridge and tunnel may have money no class very sleazy looking men and women who think they're attractive but are not at all  just such awful clientele
0,this kid named brendan i think that was his name anyway he treated me extremely rude and like a common criminal being that he was wearing two obscene diamond earrings and wearing a gun on his hip he was obviously compensating for the little man's disease so i should empathetic but whatever he's a complete ass he's not noah that's for sure ( his predecessor i assume) as i've said before about other places your money is better spent elsewhere til next time
0,responded to a craigslist ad  i contacted them and said i wanted the merchandise  they wouldn't take a credit card over the phone but said they'd hold item for 1 business dayafter work i rushed to get to the shop by the 7:00 pm close time  i was 12 min away at 6:50  i had my sister call while i was driving to tell them i was minutes away and cutting it very close  the told her they would close at 7:00 period  at 6:58 i was a few blocks away  i called again and told them where i was  they said i had 1 minute and they could not wait for me i pulled in at 7:03 according the the atomic clock  i could see two people milling around inside  they could see me  i called them  on the 2nd try they answered  i pleaded with them as i had just driven 45 minutes  as i told them i didn't even need to come in  i had cash and they could just hand me the item  they refused i cannot believe they could not conduct a transaction at 7:03 after i had called them twice and let them know exactly where i was
0,have been to all of the super pawns in town and this one had the worst customer service i find it funny how associates are so rude i may not be dressed super fancy (was in a summer dress) but i do have money to spend i will not be back to this location
0,called every location super pawn in las vegas to see if they had any iphones i was so happy because the representative i spoke to said they had a iphone 4s  it was exactly what i wanted and it was at&t phone that i wanted as well  so i was extremely happy  she asked for my name and said she'd hold it till the next morning i gave her my name and number and said i'd come in asap  and that i wouldn't even wait till the next day  i drive 20mins out there go in the store with the biggest smile for them to tell me awe i'm sorry ma'am we literally just sold it  i was just so irritated at the fact that she said she'd hold it and that i said i was coming to the store that same day i spoke to her
0,staffed but there is never anyone to help me look at something i am potentially going to buy no bargaining whatsoever not even if the item has been there forever
0,about a guitar  was on hold for over 5 minutes  called back and the gal hung up on me  called back again asking why the rude service was told they don't have the guitar i was inquiring about  probably the first time in my life as a 50 year old man that i was treated this poorly
0,is an arrogant prick
0,business ethics i have ever seen no wonder they bar the place up they are crooks went in with an limited edition ford watch they pulled one up on there computer that was not even close to the watch i brought in tring to compare prices the reason they could not find the one i have is because of its rarity the employees have no knowledge of anything and are very sloppy with no customer service the "boss"  insulted me with a useless offer would not even look me in the face and walked away in middle of conversation  something shady is a foot bottom line i got out of the geto and got $250 more then what they offered just pass this place and move on to the manager just because someone is tring to sell something does not make them desperate maybe if i had boobs you would have talked to me
0,the shadiest business i've ever stepped in made a deal on a pistol and agreed id be in at 3 show up at 3 sold it to a guy standing there just before i could get it i can understand if j was 30 minutes late  but i was there exactly at 3 then i had to deal with some old tweaker with greasy hair who tried selling me a hi point with electric tape on the grip and a ruger for what i was  uying a m&p for i stood there looking at the pistols as they walked away and disappeared greasy and unworthy of my money
0,joe the red head manager is crook he treats people very rude he will also try to burn you they should get rid of this guy i will never use this pawn shop for purchase or loans
0,stinkoso i went in here looking for a firearm that a website said they had but the gun was not in stock i think they must order guns for people or something but the pawn shop was lame and it smelled funny to they hardly had any merchandise as well would not recommend this place since they had nothing and it smelled worse than a 50 year old hodgie mart
0,book buyer is extremely rude very put out to do her job i won't be returning my husband had the same experience yesterday and i decided it was time to write a review he ended up giving a nice bum some great books
0,had a similar experience to brooke's i have been to this place four times and i would have given it three stars up until my last visit  the store is small but has quite an eclectic collection of books and i've never left empty handed i spent close to $100 there last christmas which amounted to about 30% of my overall budget for gifts the service was average at best but i'm fanatical about supporting locally owned businesses my one really negative experience i had there has me vowing to never return and go back to making my weekly trek to changing hands i had brought two plastic tubs packed full of books to sell i'm notorious for hoarding books and i always feel a bit emotional when letting some go but i was moving and wanted to thin my collection out a bit i called ahead to inquire what time would be best to bring them in when i arrived i carried the first box in a began to set it down to return for the second when a woman snapped at me and rudely said "don't set those there"  i was a bit offended but chalked it up to her having a bad day  another customer walked in who she apparently knew and asked how things were going and she said "ok but the store will probably go under if i have to keep spending money on all the books people keep bringing in"  in retrospect i should have gathered up my books and left i already was a little bummed about parting with the books and now i'm feeling like i'm an inconvenience to this woman the guy behind the counter looked embarrassed by her behavior and told me it would be about an hour so i decided to browse around the store i always keep a list of books i want to read on my phone so it thought i'd pick up my next couple of reads the whole time i was obviously attempting to locate my books i was never once offered assistance yet several other customers who came in after me were offered a warm greeting and assistance i suppose it was because they had not had the audacity to bring in books to sell  maybe because i'm heavily tattooed with several piercings she had judged me as somebody not likely to spend much money in there  well i read a lot of books and although i have an ipad i only read about 10% of them in digital format prior to walking in i had planned on just taking store credit for the books and would likely spend 5 times that much over the course of the year after that miserable experience i took the money and ran
0,have been here before and the selection is okay and the people fine i went in to sell some books today and the old woman behind the front desk was down-right rude on top of that she just meandered around as if we all had all the time in the world while she moved books back and forth between shelves it was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that i will not ever again repeat next time i will go back to bookmans
0,absolutely refuse to shop for records here after several trips spent trying to find a decent record at jerry's i gave up and never looked back the selection is terrible they may have volume but that means nothing if it's easy listening and soft rock records that you could find in better shape and cheaper at a thift store  pittsburgh has plenty of other record stores that are worth checking out but don't waste your time here plus you'll never find a new release at jerry's
0,people will try to tell you that zia records is the best record store in the valley those people would be correctwhy the low score then because being crown prince of the turd playground that is phoenix's record store selection is not exactly a glowing accomplishment this store does several things wrongfor one this location in particular pesters the shite out of you "are you finding everything alright" "are you finding everything alright" yes jesus christ i was finding everything alright the first four times you asked me now be a good little retail monkey and leave me the bloody hell alone so i can shop and eventually give you my moneyi'm sure it's this economy business that's to blame and not necessarily corporate nonsense but someone needs to take their manager out back and explain that annoying the piss out of your customers may actually be worse than ignoring them and it's just this store i went to the t-bird location and wasn't bothered someone casually asked me if there was anything i needed and i said "no" and was done with it but at this store i was literally asked three separate times by the same idiot if i was finding everything okayperhaps it was the annoying tunes they had playing that added to the grating atmosphere censored rap (not that i'm a fan but hearing the song go silent every five seconds to omit a blatant swear is fairly tiresome after awhile) 70's funk and bad butt rock seem to be on the menu ad nauseum though in fairness perhaps it's just the staff during the morning or something i notice at night it gets a bit better if you can crawl out from beneath all the employees asking you if you're doing okay long enough to even noticei've never gathered the courage to stand in the line of leering meth addicts at the trade counter to tell you whether they give decent store credit for used stuff though so i'll leave it to greater minds to judge that facet of their business model i will say that their used stuff is in good enough shape if you don't count the bleeding stickers they put on absolutely everything you inevitably spend twice the time you would have spent actually listening to your purchase doing nothing but peeling tape and stickers they're worse than gamestop that way i payed for it it's mine why are you putting your ugly stickers all over my albumbad neighbourhood tooi hate to sound so negative without balancing out with some positive but the experience is fairly fresh in my mind as i just went earlier today i guess their prices are good unless you want something newish in which case bending over and having plenty of lube handy is the best advice i can offerjust know what you want go in get out and for god's sake avoid their overzealous employees as if they were landminesor just give the constant irritants a pass and go to a different location or bookman's i know i will
0,enjoyed this place in the 90's but i really don't see why it still exists does anyone buy cd's anymore i can get any dvdbluray i want on ebay if i wanted tacky trinkets i could go to some place like spencer's in the mall or red hot robot if i fancied myself "cool" perhaps its time zia faded away like the vcr or countless other  pieces of 20th century technology
0,asked for mojo nixon  they said he don't work here  we said if you don't got mojo nixon  then your store could use some fixin'" - dead milkmen "punk rock girl"
0,employees ridiculous prices and no restroom for customer use dumb
0,found an lp i was looking for at a very fair price on their website after paying $1500 shipping it took several weeks to receive since they only put $422 postage on it to cover the media mail charge plus they shipped it 2 weeks after i paid so they overcharged me $10 for shipping and dragged their feet in shipping it i would avoid using them for any type of mail order says a lot about their business ethics or lack thereof
0,agree with ian below as well the moonlight masquerade event was the worst planned event i've ever attended there was absolutely no theme concept the music was atrociously paired (and half of the acts were unlistenable) they quickly ran out of food drinks and souvenirs within 45 minutes and the tickets were 60 frikkin dollars the botanical garden was quickly becoming a great cultural institution for it's well planned and designed events its great variety of performers and entertainment and its ties to the arts community in the valley i have heard from ex-volunteers that all the talented people in the events department have quit or been fired in the last six months because the dimwit department heads don't want to lose their jobs they are now breaking contracts with performers treating guest artists and garden staff poorly getting cheap and poor quality entertainment and mis-planning their events it's too bad looks like a bunch of fools are running the place now and i am disappointed because dbg has the potential to be a real cultural institution in phoenix - a city that has far too few
0,if you want to spend $18 to see lots and lots and lots of cactus
0,snooze fest and waste of time    there is nothing mentally or visually  engaging about the desert botanical gardens   only visit here if you have young children  who have an appreciation for cacti;  glass and bad salsa   definitely do not bring a date here like i did (there was nothing else to do in the city )she liked the butterflies ***shrugs***
0,attended a wedding reception here in june 2013  i was going to let it slide but i've changed my mind  we were really looking forward to the dinner because we had had such positive experiences at the sunday brunches with delicious food  not so much at the wedding  no where to sit during the long (over an hour) cocktail hout  servers  would come out with maybe 10 appetizers on a tray and would be attacked by the first few peopole they passed  i actually only got two tiny appetizers the entire time   when we finally went into the room (same room where the brunches are hel) we we very disappointed in the total lack of decor  absolutely nothing to indicate that there was anything speciazl - let alone a wedding - going on  no centerpeicesd - might have been the couple's decision - i don't know  dinner was not served for almost 1 12 hours - we were one of the last tables to be served  my chicken was over-cooked (actually hard on the edges - couldn't cut) and ice cold  a guest at our table had steak - and couldn't chew it and it also was cold  the salads were so under-dressed that we questioned whether they had any dressing at all  it was a huge dissapointment  the groom was visably not happy  for what they paid per person we shuld have had exceptonal food and service  both were sorely lacking  sure it's impressive to say you attended a receptiuon at phipps but the people who attended were extremely underwhelmed and definitely disappointed  my heart went out to the couple
0,second year in a row they have used the same theme nothing new and exciting go to the wynn for a beautiful flower carrousel and hot air balloon
0,today with a friend that had never been it was horrible i have never asked for my $ back and today i did everything was closed or empty so disappointing ive been there several times and have had a great time as have my kids i was embarrassed to show this place to my friend the new museum is to open up in october i hope it's worth our tax $
0,to go to the haunted harvest and not only were the lines way long and not moving but the server was down and there was zero staff communication about any of it
0,had a few moments of the kids saying "oh my gawd look at that" so i was happy they were impressed but as kate f mentioned the exhibits are depressingly small and the aptly named room of death should be condemned by zoos everywhere the only truly enjoyable moments were watching the beavers carry rocks and logs and spotting a few enormous fish otherwise the biodome was lackluster at best actually i'm surprised that eco-friendly canada stands for the place to be kept open considering how inhumanely tiny the animals' living spaces are honestly how can a beaver truly be happy in a bathtub-sized pool if there's a canadian humane society i hope they get up off their haunches and shut this place down
0,crowded and there is nothing justifying the cost go to the botanical gardens instead
0,a good vegan experience  we were meeting friends at casbah for dinner -their choice  since i follow a version of vegan i called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes  server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli   well they omitted the meat but i was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that i have ever seen  at about $20 it was close to the price of caviar
0,salty and overrated why this place is so popular i will never understand
0,strikes and you're out  we had brunch there a few months back and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it  that meal was comped and i figured it was an off day  we went back about a month later for dinner and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it  we were willing to try again so we went for dinner tonight  i ordered the filet and it was like eating a salt shaker  i was shocked that for a third time i had a piss poor meal at casbah  i sent that back and ordered the sea bass  when i got to the end of the piece of fish it was raw  needless to say i will never return to this restaurant  looking back what should i have expected from the sister restaurant of mad mex
0,curteous service but could not make up for a compltely lackluster dinner ordered the rib eye special with herbed gnocci and broccoli rabe steak was bland gnocci was dry and lacked any flavor while broccoli rabe was over salted sticky toffee pudding for dessert was too sweet this was my third and last meal there - three strikes and you are out this ca girl knows better
0,mickey mouse operation has been relentlessly spamming me for months  i am in boston not charlotte  i would never patronize a place like this  if you do be cautious -- do not give them your email
0,pains me to say after blue was my favorite restaurant for yeeeeears but spending 12 hours sick as a dog without  them doing a thing about it has forced me tooon dec 18 2010 we sprang for an overnight sitter got a room at the omni and a reservation at blue (our favorite restaurant)  by the time dinner was over i needed to use the restroom and after that barely made it back to the omni where i spent the rest of the night on the toilet  i have eaten food from street vendors in asia africa and mexico and have never had a problem; yes i have intestines of steeli called blue the next day to warn them if nothing else and was told "the chef is off but i will let him know"  i never heard another thing  i wasn't looking for a million dollars but i spent $400 for a romantic evening on the john  mistakes happen i am just disappointed in blues lack of response or concern for a loyal customer
0,i just rushed home from blue because i couldn't wait to get on here and give them this review  ok i'm lying  i made one stop on the way home - barnes and noble -  to buy a dictionary so i could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me  if not for it being restaurant week thus having reduced pricing i might have 'made a scene'so i'll start with a service review since i can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week i remind you - simplified menu 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table  the service was atrocious and incredibly slow  at the 2 hour and 15 minute mark we finally just flagged down the waitress told her to box up the food box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet just so we could finally get the heck out of there  initially i thought this was part of the "blue experience" but its not  the waitress came by every 30 minutes took the order for the next course and it took an hour for each course to come out  so the food is boxed and i come home nightmare over right  wrong they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us etc etc etc  so nobody went home with their own food  i love my friends but i'm not nibbling at their food scraps  so food how was the the food  not quite horrible but not quite good either  edible is a better word for it  i got the "grilled niman ranch pork rack chop - with a tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet italian saba"  sounds fancy eh  well it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup with a hint of chef boyardee and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle  it was so boring and bland i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do  i could walk into a grocery store blindfolded randomly grab something bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes and i would still like my chances  nobody at the table was impressed with anything they orderedso let's circle back for a second and return to service  the waitress was very nice and knowledgeable i have to say  maybe she was just over capacity  i don't know  but she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (i think)  this is how that conversation went:manager: "hey guys sorry things took a little long you know uh restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up  but how was everything"me: "well it was ok  some things were pretty good i suppose some better than others"manager: (blank stare)me:  (awkward moment)manager; "well sorry again and uh i mean you know ehhhh" (blank stare)me: (still awkward so i'm just going to stand up now and leave)manager: (blank stare and walks away)needless to say i will never come back here again  if it were free i would probably still pass  if asked what could they do to make it right i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that i'll never get back
0,food was literally inedible we had calimari as our app & it was very yummy we were excited about our entrees based on this course my husband ordered the shrimp gnocchi dish it tasted like orange peels-even the shrimp there was a pesto sauce & orange rinds in the dish which we thought was an interesting combo i never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life nothing had any other taste except orange zest i had the duck which was okay nothing to write home about the duck was really rough & fatty came with a side of asparagus & rice the veggies & rice were okay i preferred them over the duck for dessert we ordered the cheesecake to split we didn't even finish it would definitely never go back
0,am sorry to be writing this review  my first visit to blue a few years ago was fabulous  the service was very good  but this time not only was the food not impressive but it was totally boring the calamari appetizer was good but not worth $1100  the hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor  not even arranged to be appealing to the eye  my tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy tasteless   glob with carmelized onions on it that looked reheatedalso not  flavorful  the baked in house bread were blah and butter was not offered  it could have used it to help the taste  dessert was the samean amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too longdry   i love good food  but this evening was an utter disappointment  it was a birthday celebration and i did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food  i also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place i raved about prior to going service was great but the server talked me out of a couple of things i considered getting  made me think whomever was doing the cooking that nighta saturday was not good at certain things  extremely overpriced  btwcoffee was $650  c'mon now  good but not that much  sorry but i will not go back  i was sooo looking forward to this special evening  and it was an utter disappointment
0,was adequte at best and that is being generous  several of us went today for easter brunch - big disappointment  the restaurant was not that busy - took 20 minutes between courses being served  needed to ask for plates for the muffins  ordered the filet with eggs - the eggs were burnt and broken  the server never should have brought that plate to the table  i expect this from denny's at 3 am - not a restaurant with these menu prices  my boyfriend had the tomato bisque soup - was ragu in a bowl - even same consistency  another friend had the bananas foster french toast - even the bananas were bland
0,customer service  strangely rude and condescending  i confronted them about their attitude which was unnecessary  i know when poor service is justified as i've been in the industry and given it myself  it was unjustified and quite odd actually  we politely (key word) asked where a few of the ingredients were that the menu listed for our meal and that's when they became defensive and quite weird about it strangely rude and almost demeaning saying it was a waste to send it back  the pizza was slopped together the first and the second time and i don't even trust what they did to it in the kitchen  yes this is the feel i got from them being our server zach and the other man whom i believe to be the bartender or the manager   we were running a pretty high drink bill and there was no need for the negative energy it ruined our experience and vibe of the place  over a pizza  poor service poor choices
0,to say the least was looking forward to wine friends conversation and a little nosh after the artwalkwhat we got was surprisingly poor customer service that became downright passive aggressive (scratch the passive) after we received a pizza that wasn't to our liking the waiter was so upset that we didn't want mozzarella cheese on our $10 goat cheese pizza that he brought out the cook to confirm his manager then came by our table to tell us that we the customers should be aware that pizza is always served with mozz cheese (oh really astute one) 20 minutes later the manager returned with a pizza drowining in goat cheese and we were informed that we should be happy because we were getting "a bang for our buck" we felt so harassed by the wait staff because of this stupid $10 pizza that we actually feared they vandalized the food (yes you know the feeling of wondering "did that waiter spit in my dish") we left confused by the entire experience i would never never never never never go again and i will tell everyone i know to avoid this place like the plague
0,can hardly believe how highly rated this restaurantwine bar is i have been twice and both times was treated to high prices poor and condescending service and mediocre foodonce i ordered a veggie plate specifically because the menu stated that it included haricot verts when the plate came they were not on it i questioned the server and she said they were "out of season" but had not bothered to tell me in advance that the menu item would not be as described against my better judgment i went back a second time with a wine tasting group some political thing was to take place in the restaurant hours later it was being set up for so we were shunted to some tables we didn't want service was abysmal and the food and wine were really overpriced for what we received i will never go back
0,friends and i went to cheuvront's for az restaurant week and every single one of us was disappointed the service was terrible; it took 20 minutes for our fourth (who arrived a few minutes late) just to get her water he disappeared for 15 minute stretches and only asked if needed anything when we were done with our courses the food was overpriced for the portions--and this is coming from a graduated culinary student who has had it drilled into her that smaller is better--and the flavors were bland one person's bisque came to the table cold and my creme brulee tasted as if they'd forgotten the sugar not to mention that it was so loud we couldn't hear each other all around disappointing
0,friends and i came here during arizona restaurant week we made reservations arrived on time and planned on having a good time the place was half-empty and we didn't get service for water for atleast 10 minutes we wanted to order a bottle of wine but they ran out of the one we wantedit was only 6pm the waitress had a really hard time recommending another and the one she said was similar was rather icky (nothing like the wine we wanted that we've had before) we weren't able to order for atleast another 30minutes and weren't served our first course for 30 minutes after that we didn't start to eat until we had been there for an hour at minimum in addition the blackberry creme brulee also suddenly became "out of stock" and we had to choose something else this was all during one of the best promotional weeks for this restaurant i would never come back here ever
0,few months ago i wrote a very positive review of this place  starting about in september however something very odd and unpleasant happened to cheuvront  the lunch service became slow to the point where i thought i'd been forgotten  worse the food started to change in unpleasant ways  gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings  suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spicesspecifically i'm talking about the lunch pizzas i had for lunch at cheuvront so many times before  last time i went a few weeks ago i suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary  today there was four times the cheese at least two or three times the sauce along with chunks of nearly raw garlicworse the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to mei was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at cheuvront today  i don't know what happened to this restaurant but at least the lunch service is a total loss
0,where to start my friends and i were walking past when 2 men approached us and one said "hi i'm jason cheuvront" which we thought was really tacky  once in the restaurant a hostess asked us if we wanted a table and how many in our party; she then walked away and did not return so we had to seat ourselves  we ordered happy hour drinks and the glass of wine i ordered tasted like vinegar and smelled spoiled  when i told our server he said "i won't smell it because i don't like to tell customers that they are wrong" i was so shocked by his response that i did not order another drink  the server took the glass of wine back behind the bar and we then saw the owners and bartenders trying the wine and rolling their eyes  later the server returned and told me i could order any drink not just something off the happy hour menu (wasn't sure if it would be on the house or not) and then never returned to take my order when we finally tracked down another server i ordered a sangria  the server gave me a blank stare and said they did not have sangria even though it was plainly listed on their drink menu  enough was enough  we left cash on the table and left
0,to go try this place out for restaurant week stopped in and when we were greeted at the front we were told the earliest we could get in was at 9pm there were many empty tables and there wasn't even a waiting list for people without reservations the situation at the door just wasn't handled very well can't comment on the food but we'll eat at one of the other hundred restaurants in the metro area we know we can get some food there
0,waitress ran out of bruschetta and caprece salad caesar salad was warm shredded lettuce (apparently including iceberg) and tomatoes with some sort of non garlic dressing that was barely able to be tasted that is not a caesar salad  flatbread came without being cut into manageable slices and crumbled all over the place was told the bruschetta would have been made on facacio  bread  if they had any that is not bruschetta  my companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates  the kitchen was slow and the wait staff insufferable the chef is obviously very high on himself  i was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there
0,have a degree in hotel and restaurant management so you could probably say that i am a little more critical than most people when it comes to eating out  tonight my girlfriend and i went to christo's  our server was horribly slow at taking our drink orders and a table that came in after us already had their salads before we had even placed our order  the food was mediocre at best we got to go boxes because after an hour of sitting in the restaurant that apparently caters to close personal friends of abe lincoln that have nothing more to do than waste an evening at an overpriced restaurant to fill up on caesar salad that tastes like it was dipped in anchovy paste and wish that you hadn't ordered the veal genovese because it just looks like someone threw up on your plate you just want to get out of there
0,is good but the bartender stephanie is rude and ignores customers but caters to the regulars  it seems like she hates her job and is miserable  poor management and not so friendly employees   i called and left a message to speak to christo or wife gloria but of course manager intercepted the message so i never received a call back from either  i hope that christo would read  these reviews him self so he knows what goes on when he"s not around  i will never return or refer anyone and will make sure to let everyone know how rude u employees are specially bartender stephanie
0,canneloni served on a bath of poorly prepared heavy cream very 'unitalian' even the bread tastes stale and poorly prepared the minestroni soup tasted like canned soup just right for the strictly senior citizen clientele my husband had a pasta with italian sausage and chicken in a marinara sauce the chunks of canned tomatoes were unappetizing the one star is awarded for the only good item we ate the greek side salad the waiter was totally goofy rude and uninterested he flopped the canneloni at the table with the statement "two enchiladas" really first time but never again disgusting food terrible service
0,really don't even know where to start with this place  i've lived in central phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was  that's the only reason i didn't turn around and walk out upon entering  the decor in this place is cluttered old and feels dirty  they sell most of their "decorations" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one the floors the tables the walls - everything just looks old and worn  i don't find that particularly appetizing  so i figured this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation and placed my order  while very nice the staff is slow  i ordered the briesciutto  i figured brie prosciutto sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up right  wrong  the french bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread  the sun dried tomatoes were huge but overpowered everything else  i couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto     for what i paid and what i've heard i had expected much better  i was very disappointed in the entire experiencemy overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to einstein's
0,weekly empowerment meeting creates around lunch it seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy we have stumbled upon duck and decanter finding this restaurant is only half the battle the other is where the heck the front door is i felt i was intruding on the outside patrons only to realize i had to meander through taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door an added bonus i suppose opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat to your right is small wine area to the left were barrels and stuff a bit confusing but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days i had no idea what i was doing i stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats smoked meats salads and more of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpotbut not todayi will just have the insidesno bun but wait i see smoked duck and waiti can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad well that is a great compromise of course to know me is to know i am gunna ask a lot of questions my main concern does the smoked duck use nitrites nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens rather shocked by the question the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking damn i was really hoping for the duck i quickly go with plan b as i weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oilwith that it was the tuna salad you can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the storeso i did there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request i was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww there was also an espresso area but it was not operational there are gadgets to buy for your kitchen and packaged condiments and foods that i presume they make fresh there there are fountain drinks  bottled drinks good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant and there is not tempting this fort knox (well the rice cripsy treats lookednooo mustresisti get my food pay and go up stairs there are different levels and two places to sit outside which makes this place even more interesting i open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna i read the entry for the entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread i ordered the salad due to the fact i can not tolerate gluten too hungry to care i peel off the bread and i dive into my food and i am shocked at how awful it is what is that mushy stuff i think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad who puts water chestnuts (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad i was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist) some sliced celery and string cheese cheese who eats cheese with their tuna the tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking and i had a tough time getting it down and eventually i got so turned off i did not finish it there was no dressing and no taste  i ended up not eating the salad either what a waste of  $1000 including guilt tip at least the company i was with was fantastic some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible i truly believe this is something duck and decanter could adopt maybe i was supposed to order dressing i have no idea since i had never been there before and did not know what i was doing i did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh i can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety is this a place for those who are celiac or gluten intolerant no there is not enough awareness of ingredients and handling of food bathrooms yes weirdoutside of the building but clean would i return no but for the sake of my friends which is way more important i will and eat some where else first
0,don't understand the regular bustle and patio crowd here except for maybe the wine  i thought the sandwiches were just so so unmemorablethe tea as well
0,i've been going to this place for years not bc the food blows my mind but rather it hits the spot plus i love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal anyhow my other best gal my mom had never tried this spot i  thought duck would be great for a quick casual lunch she's a vegetarian so we ordered the where's the beef sandwich to share it took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich which feels like an eternity when your hungrywhen i glanced at the sandwich i thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it turns out the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado really i mean come on avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians how can you f this up it was truly nasty it got me to thinking if someone actually put this into the sandwich what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie it's not like they make them with blindfolds on i was really grossed outwhen i brought it to the manager's attention she didn't seem that bothered by it they remade half a sandwich for me and that was thatit was annoying bc i left feeling that duck & decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what well not this oneplus that place needs a serious dusting yuck
0,was very shocked to see that my review from yesterday had been hidden what is the point of this website if people can't write their opinion obviously whoever is in charge of this restaurant's yelp site didn't want people to see how poorly my children and i were treated at this establishment a friend of mine and our 3 little boys (two of them babies) came into eat yesterday when a manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet it down it was quite ridiculous and offensive seeing that two of the children are one year yes sir let me talk some sense into my baby and tell him that he is being rude i bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty also a note to whomever this concerns in management in control of this site: if you take my post down again i will continue to write this review
0,was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state i recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery  it was awful long wait skimpy sandwich loud music on patio so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience i couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me   this was the 29th and a sunday brunch  disappointed will not go back especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in phoenix  you can't rely on a name duck and decanter your poor service etc will catch up and you will not survive  my advice to all who ask  where is a good place to eat i will say not duck and decanter
0,poisoning for two pleasei am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place the 4-star average yelp rating was the reason my wife and i chose to dine here during our stay in phoenix yelp you really let us down this timeso i was on company business travel in phoenix the week of march 12th and my wife was traveling with me we had a french impulse that tuesday night and tried to crash petite maison in scottsdale only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available the following night still craving french cuisine we decided to stop in at sophie's french bistro in phoenixthe first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours however encouraged by the strong reviews on yelp we decided to go ahead and order we took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following3 cheese platechef's patecalamaricrispy duck breastcreme bruleethe food was average at best my wife and i both tend to critique food as we eat it and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistencythe fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room we both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning followed by the onset of stomach pain no big deal i thought by shortly after midnight we were each fighting for time in the bathroom taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night i'll try to spare you the details but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that i have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life needless to say diarrhea was also involvedafter going through this for a good two hours my wife and i were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated my wife even told me she felt like she was dying and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth ooso by around 2:30am my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance for a while neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone i eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly i carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospitalwe drove to john c lincoln hospital on dunlap which i recommend if you ever get poisoned by sophie's french bistro i managed to get there without hitting anything which was remarkable since i could barely see straight and could barely function at all once inside my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly the nurses and doctors rushed her into the er and brought her back around they gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an iv drip of fluids as i waited i continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated despite being in a hospital i was determined not to check myself in for treatment not wanting to add further medical billssometime around 5:00am my wife was ready to be discharged the official diagnosis was acute food poisoning we were never able to identify the specific meal at sophie's which poisoned us as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts eachhowever - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was sophie's they remarked "oh that place" we learned that the er at john c lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by sophie's the hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against sophie's with the az department of health services they told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreakthis all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place i can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere too weak to write a reviewplease please please don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night after this experience we lost all desire to dine in phoenix ever again thanks sophie's for ruining our tripfor the record we did have an excellent meal at cibo pizza the night before we were poisoned i highly recommend cibo great food without food poisoning
0,place was pretty desertedi discovered  why the inside has a slightly funky odor like spoiled cheese and cheap wine the owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what i wanted i'm assuming he was the owner because he had a european accent and his clothes were better than mine and he had an aura of arrogance and authoritythat's all it took for me to turn around and walk out the door if all french bistros are like this one then i'm steering clear of them in general sophie's really sucks
0,postino wine cafe makes me feel like i am in another city an urban metro pedestrian city such as san francisco its casual yet sophisticated and quite enjoyable i recently visited postino with two friends and had the bruschetta -- we selected the fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil the smoked salmon and the roasted peppers with goat cheese thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers the clientele is a hip diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes and yet just a hop from the biltmore and arcadia neighborhoods ah phoenix is growing up wish i knew more about wines to tell you more about that it appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well parking is a challenge however i will definitely be backhttp:wwwpostinowinecafecomupdate: postino's is one of many restaurantsbars in az that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the arizona state rifle and pistol association in their ccw cafe page: http:wwwasrpacomccwcafehtml for that reason i am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star
0,won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place but a few notes: no it is nothing like a european cafe; no it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely suckswe came here for a friend's birthday party her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor but before that let's start with parking you can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit fine i heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so whatever i head to the valet who asks me if i am dining at postino's or la grande orange i say postino's and he says "ok that's $3" i asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant i was going to and they wouldn't answer i asked if there was an atm since i had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work i got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes fantasticwhen i get there about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them finally a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said "those are yours those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet we told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there" ok so now we only have two of our four tables great finally they seat us at our two tables another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo she pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away upon her return i asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a malbec she argued with me about that for a few minutes until i pointed to the label she said "oh" and walked away i never did find out if we were supposed to have the malbecat this point the other two tables had been cleared no one brought any other glasses or put the tables together so we did it also no one opened the other bottles and yes they were screwtop but still so i opened them finally everyone else arrived we still only had 4 wine glasses after trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded rudely "we don't have any more" and walked away i had to ask three different rude uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still not everyone ended up with a glass seriously anyway the bruschetta came out while the menu offers a lof of different ones they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished the fig marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced dry flavorless most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart the bread was obviously just grocery store bread and i doubt anything is truly hand-made the issue is the quality of their ingredients sucks they obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up everything even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy and as for a wine bar seriously a joke they have a half of a sheet of paper one side as their wine list no flights no tastings but for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area they'll continue to do just fine i will never be back
0,try to like you postinos i really do but you make it so hard  came on a tuesday for their 8 pm $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyedthe parking lot disaster strikes again  lgo now put up signs saying 25 min parking for lgo customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces  i was told by the lot monkey that i could valet ($3 charge) or i could park 3 blocks away if i didn't want to pay the fee  keep in mind this is a tuesday and i have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spacesonce seated my friend and i tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders  since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu  our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order  no suggestions on a wine no questions if we had questions just "you ready to order"we ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared  for the rest of the night  i watched him refill wine glasses at other tables ours was brought by another server  other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished ours sat in front of us until another server took them away  our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert  we said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left  no offer of another round of drinks just here is your checkthe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta  the bruschetta themselves were half assed  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decentyet again postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage  i don't understand how i am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here
0,totally 100% agree w serianna ti have felt the same way about the seating and parking and mediocre foods postino and lgo are complete cluster f***s for anyone who plans on driving there i also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guests
0,postino wine bar or is it postinos or postino wine cafe whatever i would definitely consider myself a postino expert postino was a go to for countless dates of mine i have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed when i first stated going to this postino i loved it me and my roommate would visit every sunday religiously we always got great service food was fantastic and timely but it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees i no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers i had no idea it was there business how many women i take on dates there you would think the business would be appreciated i was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend i would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date very unprofessional staff at this locationi recommend going to the newer central & camelback location if you are planning on visiting postino pros:- cheap tasty bruschetta- reasonable wine prices- decent beers on tap- crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills- short wait timescons- rude servers- shallow menu- bad for taking dates
0,yesterday for the first time it gets one star because the food was yummy got the choose two- nine iron sandwich with mediterranean salad very good lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking lost a star because i do not like eating up meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill lost a star because i don't like eating in my living room why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room if you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside not fond of high tops either lost a star because they opened the garage door we chose to sit inside for a reason they opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees
0,warned gluten went for happy hour expecting to have gf food postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seatedcome to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy we were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches but upon further questions about the meats cheeses etcetera being gf they took back their reassurances close call to being poisoned
0,good  too small n its overrated who waits 1hr for a glass of wine i would rather get a bottle n drink at home
0,place is a joke if they think they compare to any sort of respectable wine bar if this comment offends you feel free to pull down your pants and start crying now after looking over what i would consider the 'cliffs notes' version of a wine list (bs on calling yourself a wine cellar) we chose a bottle of the onehope red cab i was happy to learn that half the proceeds went to the cure for autism until i realized that the waitstaff could have used the money as they all had some special needs of their own in an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu  the tomatobasilmozzarella bruschetta had no basil (wtf) the orzo and shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers just because you throw something 'fancy' on the menu like duck confit doesn't mean you have a license to lack on quality thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening if it weren't for the 2-man live band playing a lively rendition of mygirl in the corner i don't know if we would have survived the evening ;)
0,am the co-organizer of a meetupcom group comprised of african women my group organizer and me found a website listing 2013 dates for free wine tasting i called the bar to confirm the days of the week and time for wine tasting about two months before the event was posted the day of the event i called as instructed before with the total number of attendees there were fifteen in our group that day soon after arrival  i asked the waitress when the wine tasting going to start the waitress told me the days of the wine tasting were held during the week of course a wine tasting was not schedule for the day the group visited the my wine cellarthe owner an asian woman came over and shared with me and members of the group "you should have called did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website" this was the extent of the owner's response until i found the website with the information about the wine tasting on my smart phone the owner looked at the website i pointed out the information on this site was more recent in publication than the wine cellar website she responded again with the same statements as before and walked away the feedback from the group was consistent members of the group as well as myself were irritated at the owner indifference the owner was aware of the information out there about her company language used thus response "did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website" the waitress was very helpful and apologized the owner did not the owner put the blame on me "you should have called i have been an organizer of a meetup group and i called before" i dida member of the group went to the owner to share her dismay at the indifference one of the owners replies from the conversation included "so tell me what do you want for free" yup nice the owner sent over a bucket of wine with no glasses we ended up using water glasses that were left at the table from when we were first seated we were there for two hours making the best the situation the average bill ranged from $15 to $60 the group will not come back to the wine bar this review will be posted everywhere it can be posted by the way the food was okay and the drinks prices average
0,really really wanted to like this place we've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent the first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio we really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything i brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit this time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food again a really inattentive server when we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst i asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left when we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline she then came to the table and took our order 30 seconds later she comes back telling us "sorry you missed the cut-off for happy hour"yeah we missed it because you never came back grrrrwe received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)and waitedand waited no one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food when our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you seriously it's bad enough that they are cooking with a fry daddy but never never tell your customers something like that  after 40 full minutes we received our appetizers our wine glasses empty no she didn't ask if we wanted another glass she then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries that other girl will take care of you "that other girl" never came byever we had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check i fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no not even an apology so i told them our experience and the manager came over she said she was happy to take off one appetizer great except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today so we waited for our revised billand waitedand waited are you kidding me we had to go up to the bar to get the check it's a nice little wine bar with pretty good food but 3 strikes and you are out we will not return here very unfortunate for us and them
0,service  the brushetta was cold and it took them 40 mins to bring it out  the manager that wanted to discuss the problem with was very confrontational
0,food was great but the service is some of the worst i've ever experienced the manager samantha really needs a lesson in customer service completely rude
0,bit frustrated as we drove all the way over here to meet some friends our friends were at the bar waiting for us but there was a lady at the door not allowing us in because they someone was having a 'rehearsal dinner' they put a sign on the front door 'we've reached maximum capacity' and that was just tacky if you're having a private party or special event turn off the open sign and put a sign up that says private event tonight
0,use to go here once or twice a week when it was a hole-in-wall pizza joint and the owner worked there everyday  really good pie and service it had a perfect pizza joint atmosphere too then they got really popular expanded hired more help churched the the place up and raised the prices i stopped going when i had two back to back experiences with bad food and bad service the last time i went there was for a large pie and my bill was $40 now  costco's pizza is better and a whole lot less expensive
0,what am i reviewing here i wish i was reviewing the decor which is sleek and very cool the service which was great the wine which in this area is incomparablebut i'm not reviewing any of that i'm reviewing the shrimp scampi pizza and the linguini with white clam sauce one of which gave me the rumblies in my tummy which would not go away until i "moved" them out so yes this review comes from the bowels of my hearwell no just my bowels you made them very unhappy i give you 10 stars for the decor and the wine bar itself but on the seafood my bowels give you -9 insert mad face herethe bowels not me it actually tasted pretty good going down
0,used to be a favorite place of mine the service standards have gone downhill quite a bit one example is i waited 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea at the bar the food is still outstanding but i think i will take my hard earned money to sal's gilbert pizza you have truly let me down pesto's
0,again  terrible service average pizza ho hum wine list  took forever to get a glass of wine never heard from the server after she dropped the pizza on the table  and the bill was unbelievably high for the quality of the food  server never asked us if we wanted another glass of wine or offered us dessert  don't go - there's nothing to like about this place
0,am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salty when the waitress asked me how everything was i had to say something she was very nice and offered me another dish but i declined then the owner came over and seemed pissed i complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed then the owner said "well i brought you a cannolli i hope it is not to salty or bland for you" and walked away my wife and i where open mouthed i will never return after being treated like that if you do not want to hear how the food was from the customer then don't ask i also think the owner was drinking and maybe that's why she was so mean i run a business of my own and if i ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that i would fire them on the spot
0,service awful beef tacos and horrible service we actually had to approach the bartender for our food and drinks wish i could have a job where all i do is sit and play games on my phone would not come back and definitely don't recommend it two thumbs down
0,a private wedding reception on saturday afternoonevening  bad experience (with the alcohol part)  i don't know what was charged to the wedding couple but it was a rip-off  money was given for open bar (a limited amount) and a certain amount was supposed to be held for the wedding party (about 12)  lots of guests arrived before the wedding party and the bartenders had pretty much burned through the bar tab limit before the wedding party arrived  brand drinks were cash bar and my wife and i have our preferences so i paid out of pocket for all of our drinks (should have helped with the rest of the guestsbut)  anyway the bar closed off the 'tab' way too early i think they just double-billed and ripped us off  at my arrival i ordered 2 drinks and was charged $1850 (plus tip) 45 minutes later i ordered two more of the same drinks charge: $19  45 minutes after after that i ordered the same 2 drinks again charge: $2150 (before tip) now howwhy did the price increase from $1850 to $2150 in the course of an hour and a half unless it was a rip off  (several complaints heard about weak or no alcohol mixed drinks at $9 apiece) the dance floor was ok  the conversation nooks were good but i don't like to be taken advantage of  complaining at a wedding reception makes you look like a jerk  soooo i'm telling you now i will never go there based on this first and last exposure to this  place  you'd think they'd try to impress folks at a special occasion like this so those of us might go back on our own  instead why would i go expecting to get screwed
0,sunset club for putting me through hell  my friend and i decided to stop in after tyber was beat  the first thing that sucked was the cover was expensive for such a small club ($20)  the dj was probably the only good thing in here we decided to get some drinks and had fun dancing and mingling with some ladies but at the end of the night is where hell hit i went to close out my tab and my tab was $97 for 3 beers  i told the bartender she must have made a mistake she goes oh its not a mistake  some black guy was using your card and purchased 5 bottles of champagne and this tab  the card got declined ( thank god somehow) after he tried to swipe it for the 5th time in an hour and he left basically the bartender gave my debit card to another guy the manager came out and and the bartender explained then that she handed my card to another guy and he was using it all night  i told her to cancel out all the charges because the liability falls on you  she said no  i ended up calling the cops and when she spoke to the cops her story changed she said that the bartender never gave my card to him and that he must have been using my name  the cops then told me to dispute with the card company because it wasnt getting anywhere  3 months later my case is finally closed and i have my $500 back  eff this place
0,disappointed  they no longer have shows in the big theatre where the big stage is  instead bands perform in a large space adjacent to the large and torn down theatre there's a bar where you can buy overpriced drinks  beers were $5  there's no place to sit to watch the bands everybody stands  the men's bathroom reeked of urine  the current management doesn't get it  people heartily supported this place when the big theater was in operation  we drove from 45 miles away and were utterly disappointed the acoustics in the new space are awful  the band sounded muffled  fortunately the dog bar was a block away and it was easy to comfort our disappointment with some canine friends
0,monks all i can sayrequires a minimum of $50 per person for "donations" on major holidays they won't even supply plates and utensils for the people to eat the food they yell at you i grabbed a paper plate from somewhere and this woman snatched it back and gave me a stink eye monks are always seen at casinos gambling i used to work at coach inc (purse store) they would go in and shop all the time now i saw them at apple buying 2 ipads with our donation money screw this corrupt place and their corrupted monks they don't even follow the rules of buddhism this place is a joke
0,cheese selectionbeautiful homemade pasta and saucesi can't say enough about how good every single sauce i have tried is served with their perfect pasta i've had to edit my review of pasta & provisions for one simple reason their store is so unorganized and their staff so lazy and unmotivated that it is a chore to try to shop therei can't remember the last time i went to their store that all of the items that i purchased made it home in my bag they will randomly leave out at least one item every tripi don't know if this is an effort to increase their profits by stealing from their customers or if their front counter staff are just that incompetent but even with a concerted effort i still end up at home unpacking my bag wondering how exactly that i don't have the bread i purchased or the cheeses or the ham or whatever it is that they have charged me for that they didn't put in the bagdon't try to call to complain either there is never any management or owner there and you will talk with a high school aged person who doesn't know and doesn't care
0,am sorry i would like to buy food from your establishment the whole idea of it appeals to me  that is the good news  the bad news is i have bought several of your prepared food items   they have all been very disappointing  tonight we ate baked ziti imy husband and i both agree that it was so pasty and we ended up throwing the most of it away   honestly you could go to food lion and get a better dish we expected so much morei am soorry   such a great location
0,was so excited about finding a place in charlotte that sells fresh pasta and sauces   we were greated with questions about where we parked our car and if we were coming in the store or restaurant next door  walked inside to be greated with head banging music that made me want to stab my ears out  found a freezer full of sausage with the sell as date of 424 (three days ago) frightening   go to the counter to find no fresh ravioli (all frozen) also all frozen capavetti and gnocchi  all types of sauces are also frozen except one the kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better  whatever  the display had a sign for three types of focacci  i asked for 2 of the 3 no luck   i bought the rosemary focacci and it's sold warm and it's not bad   i also decided to try a frozen florantine ravioli and frozen gnocchi   they packed the warm bread in the bag on top of the frozen pasta   unbelievable   i will report back on the quality of the half defrosted pasta after i cook it  very disappointed in this place
0,sold a vacuum sealed bag of grains in a brew kit chock full of insects when i called ( admittedly 3 months later) the owner said it was my fault i had not used the grains soon enough because the insect eggs were already in the grains really    i didn't argue because i had waited but when i asked him over he phone if he would prepare me another bag as i was driving down to the store  he gave me a long sarcastic sigh and told me i would have to wait because he couldn't  drop everything and deal with my problemwhen i got the store 5 minutes later no customers were there and the owner wouldn't show his coward face one of the more helpful employees mix up my bag and i paid him and that is the last money they will ever get out of me
0,making a customer's paymento atlowe's we have our checklist:1 do the phone numbers match  nope but that's fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways2 does the name on account match name on check  nope but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies3 does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen  why should it those computers are always making mistakesnow that we have verified that all the information is correct we can process the payment  the customer will be so happy that we didn't have to bother them with any silly questions******i am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence  what was originally an average lowe's has turned into lowe's hell  if the associates do not have basic logic comprehension how do they survive
0,like to give no stars  bought all new kitchen appliances there  refrigerator is defective  theysend an outside company to repair  man arrives with no tools and wrong size seal for freezer  not once twice  the first time he tries to use my spoon from counter to install it  i complain too badthey have to comethree times before replacing it  never again
0,would rather drive out of my way to another home depot than give this location my business employees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them strike that i'm certain they notice they just don't carei'm a pretty understanding person but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit it's time to go there are plenty of hd's around seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)
0,has happened to the east liberty home depot  it used to be my "go-to" place for everything diy but no longer  i stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles tension rods quarter round molding etc  i came away with none of it  everything we wanted was out of stock  when i asked if i could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) i was told that the items i wanted were not "qualified" for delivery to the store  "when will the items be restocked"  "don't know"  "would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region"  "no that 'messes with' our inventory controls"  oh but i was told i could haul my sorry butt out to monroeville where the stock of everything i wanted was plentiful  really the staff i dealt with could not have cared less about helping me  maybe because it was a holiday (new year's eve)  dunno  don't care  customer service should not ebb and flow based on the daydate  the east liberty hd used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices  and the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers  no longer  it appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death  very disappointing to me
0,20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a friday afternoon  priceless
0,on a tuesday to inquire about replacement sheet of glass for my tec grill the gentleman who answered the phone said it would cost $149 take about 3 weeks and he wanted 50% down to place the order then i called tec directly tec said it would be $70 and i'd get it by the end of the week it arrived today friday talk about price gouging
0,used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business  however with the last experience i will have to rethink that my aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday when it was delivered it looked beautiful  however once opened not so much  inside it was filled withdollar general brand goods when i stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect if it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip so moral of the tale if you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the dollar store you know where to go to make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care
0,store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving i was with 3 white people and 1 black person when we left the worker pulled the black person aside and demanded to check his pockets she did and found nothing in the middle of the strip district this store can still be racist
0,gone to rollier's a lot over the years whenever i needed a personal touch - something you can't get at places like home depot  last week i went in with a busted window screen frame  i wanted to replace it and rollier's has built replacement screens for me in the past  for some reason this time mt in plumbing was determined to repair my frame instead of sell me a new one  he told me that my frame hardware was actually thinner than what he had to sell and it wouldn't fit  (later i determined that not to be true - its the same size)  he said instead he could put a brace across the frame  ok i said  i'm always open to saving $50+  well that brace added at least 18" thickness to the frame  now it won't fit  if he was concerned that a new frame would not fit why would he think this very thick brace would  i had to remove that brace to get the frame back on the window  so he wasted my time probably over 2 gallons of $4gallon gas and took $2567 from me   so much for the personal touch  i think i will stick for the impersonal honesty of home depot for now on
0,horrible quality half of the things are at the end of their shelf life and some are even beyond that- basically some of the things are already gone bad that they are selling good luck returning things as the old lady will go psycho on you and start screaminghaha what a joke i feel pity for them and anyone who might get an experience like i did when i tried to return honey that they sold me which was already bad probably due to poor temperature control they have in their shop in summers they rely on air coolers and you can imagine az 110 degree days you would feel like you just walked in a oventhe old lady (owner) is rude and has no etiquettes of how to deal with a customeri would recommend never walk into that shop or learn from your own bad experience i wasted my time money and had bad experience that is going to stick with me for quite some time feel bad for other single owners as she is representing them in the worst possible way for the first time i realized some of the good things that big chains offer sorry for being so verbosebut she made us and my wife real upset

0,stars for the foodanother cumulative star for the service making them a solid fivethat was before we checked outminus five for their not having a defibrillator anywhere on site when my heart began missing beats right after their informing me how two cups of turkey soup one half sandwich a whole sandwich two iced teas a cookie and a small slice of bread pudding came to forty-seven bucksi must have appeared to the cashier as a mouth-breather and to everyone else in line when i stood there frozen vegetatively reverberating;  "huhforty-seven bucksreallyhow is that even possible[head shake]eventually my friend's laugher brought me back but it was my turn to pay for lunch so i couldn't tell them to stuff their forty-seven bucks and walk out this place is in the middle of bfe with nowhere else to eat except the desert and i don't care for cactus or rocksso i sucked it upand did the only thing i could do under the circumstancesi sat there eating my lunchfixating on how i'd just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a fucking turkey sandwich not going back
0,i hope this review does exactly what i intend for it to do get the principals of this joke for a restaurant  who ever they are  to read it and wake up obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this placelet's start at the beginning went for lunch walked in saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us nope nothing of the sorts walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance again what do i do next people inside look at you but don't ask to help you we had our dog with us so i asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out she walked to the counter and again no one would help can i order then a person replied and pointed "you start down there" okay great were getting somewhere she placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table i have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich"  i sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (this is a farm) and she went to get the sandwich  oh the daymare has just started after about 20 minutes she sent me a text and said" i haven't left you still waiting" this is chicken salad people slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go here's where it gets really good several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella my girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting she taps on the window and asks " is there a problem with the chicken salad"  "i'll check"  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich  now i would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said "how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich" he had been waiting 30 minuteswe eat what i would say is ordinary fresh food nothing to write home about and because i found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous i stopped back in to express myself and politely said  "this is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return"their response exactly like the whole experience started nothingand although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely overpriced
0,never darken their doorway again i moved to the area four months ago and have surprisingly had a difficult time finding a place to buy fresh meat i am used to the amish markets in md i tried this place and was completely ignored from the moment i stepped into to the door my visit was short and not sweet at all i wish there was an option to not give a single star
0,hull is great but not great enough to overcome the poor treatment from the business office  don't ask for anything out of the ordinary like calling in a mail order script  they are a well oiled machine and you are truly just a number there
0,don't walk away from carmel family physiciansi've been a patient of cfp for about 3 years  i've never really been happy but as i've been looking to leave the area i hadn't pursued another doctor until now  by far the biggest problem they have is their phonesupport staffi certainly don't expect cfp to diagnose me over the phone but if i contact them for a follow up on an appointment i had it's like pulling teeth to get a call back  calls typically take multiple business days to be returned - if they are at all  this includes the time that i was in pain to the point i was spending 12 the day in bed  or the time i was traveling and forgot my prescription and asked for a small quantity to be prescribed as i was 2000 miles away from the only bottle i had  i've even called and spoken with management about not getting timely callbacks but nothing has changed after monthstheir patient referral service isn't any better  i've been called and "told" by their staff when my referred appointment was - without any input from me on what fits my schedule  i've tried asking them for the name of the doctor so i can make my own appointment only to be told they don't have that and only the referral person does  or the time i was in pain making it impossible to leave bed and the only doctor they could refer me to didn't have any appointments for 15 months - and they had no other suggestions on where to go  the final straw was when i inquired about a preventive medicine for me  the response i was given amounted to "i've heard of that but i don't know enough about it to be comfortable prescribing it"  there was no willingness for the doctor to research and follow up to me  he couldn't even recommend a specialist who was familiar with it - and this wasn't an experimental treatment - this was a relatively new but manufacturer-recognized use of a 10+ year old medicinei don't think i've ever felt that cfp was customer-focused  rather when i go there i feel like i am viewed as a "necessary evil" for them to collect their money  don't go here - you will regret it
0,is friendly enoughdrs are quick and dont really listen or ask any questions ive changed drs since my last visit and am very happy i had an appt that i had rescheduled here and they keep sending and will not stop sending a letter asking me to pay for a missed visit when i called to cancel a week before found a way better drlittle better to drive but at least i feel like im getting the customer service i deserve
0,been mis-diagnosed many times by dr austin the wait is always an hour or two and you have to keep calling the office to get results
0,am shocked over these reviews i'm going to have to assume its family or something i was an unfortunate victim of this group of gps for years because of the long list of the things i needed to see dr lyndo for (no longer there) i felt like i couldn't go anywhere else  i honestly felt trappedthis is the wonderful help i've gottendr daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while i listened it had only been an hour wait getting in to examination roomthe receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxiousthey have just about done everything but give me the finger i can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of everyone ask about it and ask quite rudely then tell me they "tried" to call  so i deserve being called up to the front of the class so embarrassing especially when your sick they even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid and told me i couldn't see the dr because of it thats after i had waited fifteen minutes already i have no idea what i was supposed to do go beat up his insurance companythen there was the time i was prescribed medication that sent me to the er wait no hold on there was the two times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the erand the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess and then when dr bauer accused me of being a smoker when i told her i wasn't she told me i was lyingbecause you know thats what i do lie to gp'sits a bit of a sinful delight for me i always hope it gets me improved careoh wait the long waits where always enjoyable if i got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle you better plan on a lonnnnnng wait they are making vacation plans after all i could go on for days this place is awful **awful***  please go somewhere anywhere else  the homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care he'd be cheaper thats for sure
0,the worst service i have even had in my entire life  i recently moved here from out of state and was referred to dr o'clair by a coworker  on my way to the appointment my gps took me in a round about way and i knew i would be late so i called ahead the staff told me that it was not a problem  i finally got to the office at 4:15 and was asked to sit down after waiting for another 10 minutes i was called up to the desk and told that i was more than 15 minutes late and had to reschedule my appointment my appointment was at 4:00 so apparently they cannot tell time  i explained that i called ahead got lost and that i was a student who also worked part time so it was very hard for me to reschedule and  the doctor actually refused to see me the staff was incredibly rude and should have told me not to come in the first place i left the office in tears out of frustration and embarrassment from the way i was treated it is clear that dr o'clair has no respect for her patientsas if we have never waited 15 minutes for a doctor before
0,been to the doctor in 5 or 6 years so i thought i would go and get checked out  my insurance covers preventative care 100% and i have a large deductible for sick visits  i went had no health complaints and the nurse told me i was the healthiest person she had seen all daythe practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance which applied $130 to my deductible  i called the billing number explained the situation and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance  the billing person told me the doctors pick the code not the billing people but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next dayhe never called  i left two voicemails for the billing guy which he never returnedi appealed to my insurance who denied because the doctor used a sick visit codesooo my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100% by my insurance  the office is yet to explain the "problem of medium to high severity" described is the cpt code  the only diagnosis billed is v700 adult well visitthis post is probably more about the billing dept but still makes me mad
0,charge an annual administrative fee that is not covered by insurance  basically it's like a credit card annual fee  this year 2012 it's $60  i'm not one to pay annual fees at my bank on credit cards and definitely don't want to start at my doctors office :(  it's up to you though
0,been seeing dr goldman for more than 10 yrs  very happy with him and his staff  about a yr or so ago i stopped going to him  he charged an administrative fee of yearly $35 or something ridiculous for seeing him for paperwork etc processing  really  even couldn't be grandfathered in after i complained for being a long standing patient  he moved from 40th & bell to camelback and i continued to see him  i didn't ask him for more gas  i continued to make the much longer trip & nvr complained  this took the cake  a drs office charging an adm fee  argh i have since gotten a very nice doctor around the corner i'm happy with but decided since apparently i'm still good enough for their email list and had a yelp link i'd give my 2 cents worth
0,me preface this review:i live a healthy lifestyle exercise regularly don't smoke and rarely drink  i rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why i came in because i've been having trouble sleeping i made an appointment with kate montgomery  rn cs fnpall i can say is wow i've never felt so judged in my life she was down right rude canceled all my remaining appointments they also charge some bs annual fee not covered by insurance i will finding another doctor that is not so judgmental if i were you i would pass on this facility
0,all just an update 2232013- i changed drs because of the admin fee and the office is still trying to charge another "administration fee"  soooo that pretty much means there is a bi-annual admin fee charged  was forced to pay the first fee because i was a patient trying to get the most recent fee charged last month removed since i'm not their patient- patient beware it's like a bad late night infomercial "how do i cancel"  grrrrr
0,this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back  it's sad bc i feel the care was really great
0,the administration fee is true and now i will not be going back  you have got to be kidding me  like someone stated earlier i pay a copay every time i go in there and they bill my insurance for anything additional they do  this is total bs  i thought i was going to the doctor not a gym  the doctors are good there but it is soooo slow  if you have a 10am appointment don't expect to get in before at least 10:30ami called and i was told this fee was to offset the cost of the lab emr and patient portal cost  i'm not sure what lab they are referring to because every time i have blood drawn they send it off to some place called labcorp  isn't this the cost of doing business  so should i start deducting a set amount for the employees that work for me for the cost of internet and the payroll system we use  i don't think so
0,been a patient of dr wyse for several years i have always booked my appointments first thing in the morning to avoid waiting in the 'little white room' too long after the third time of waiting over an hour after arriving at 7:30 in the morning and nothing more than a "i'm very booked" as an apology i've decided it's best to move on and find a new family doctor there are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait this unfortunately is not one of them i find it very arrogant when anyone feels their time is more important than yours
0,have used yelp to find doctors in the past i found a wonderful doctor through yelp who unfortunately closed his practice :(  i can't say strongly enough use this yelp review and find another doctor  i wish i had read the reviews on this practice before i went for my first appointment it would have saved me a lot of unnecessary stress
0,was referred to this practice by a colleague of mine i was very excited to find a "one stop shop" family practice where lab and x-ray's can be done in the office to avoid the troubles of having to go to a lab and wait for the results then go back into the office dr sobel is a very personal man i have no qualms with him however my first visit jessica was quite rude and remained so with every visit  although i had a scheduled appointment i waited in the lobby for about 30 plus mins before being walked back only to wait another 15-20 mins before dr larry would see me at first i thought it was just an anomaly however it was like that every visit and the office staff was not forthcoming about running behind schedule and very unapologetic yesterday's experience took me over the edge my appt was at 3:40pm i did not get called back into the office until after 4:45pm literally i had checked in with "jessica" a couple of times to inquire as to why it was taking so long she said my "chart was up there and will be called in order" stating "this is dr larry"  however i noted some people were called in earlier than i that came in later i was finally seated in an exam room and waited until 5:14 pm before coming out and asking what the deal was i asked if dr sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time they said "it's dr sobel" "he spends a lot of time with his patient's" although that may be a good thing it should not be at the expense of the next patient  it is my professional opinion that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen this kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable of note dr larry sobel overheard my questioning and while visiting with another patient and said"you can leave if you want" i left and will not be back againthe courtesy from his staff up front should've been dr larry is running an hour behindand allow me the option to reschedule
0,doctors spend barely any time with you after making you wait forever then rush you out without hearing you out the staff is incredibly abrasive and unhelpful
0,a long wait to see the doctor today waited an hour and a half with no one updating me with ones going on or an apology went to get a refund of my copay and still no apology or even an option of let me see how much longer becky may be great but the front staff will keep me from going back never happy with the staff every time i've gone and this what the icing on the cake
0,it's changed be forewarned the staff is unfriendly or rude depending on your ethnicity and you can wait up to 1 hour and a half before you finally see the doctor although dr larry can be insightful the staff at the front desk and the wait time in which they are unapologetic for and do not schedule accordingly are not worth my time try camelback family health
0,the "poor" reviewrating is only for john c lincoln health network - saguaro family practice facility and staff and not for dr mora whom our entire family loves dr mora is our family doctor dr mora is incredibly knowledgeable and getting an appointment to see him is very easy when you meet dr mora he always greets you with a hand-shake and takes the time to sit down and actually talk to you about your healthcare needs it is important to note that dr mora has moved his practice location recently dr mora used to be with john c lincoln health network - saguaro family practice group located at 18404 north tatum boulevard  phoenix az 85032 (602) 992-1900 this john c lincoln group was atrocious with the exception of dr mora and his medical assistant erica the rest of the staff there were terribly rude not to mention the office was always filthy which did not make me feel very comfortable going there (also you should know that if you call the john c lincoln office where dr mora used to work they will not tell you that dr mora has moved instead they will try and make you see one of their other doctors there and i would not recommend any other doctor there to see) so i couldn't be happier that dr mora has moved dr mora now works for scottsdale healthcare primary care paradise valley 5010 e shea blvd suite d100 scottsdale az 85254 (480) 882-7420 this new location is the kind of doctor office you feel comfortable going to it is very clean and the staff are very courteous and extremely helpful if you are new to the valley or looking to change doctors please consider going to see dr mora at his new practice location you will not find a better doctor in the valley than dr mora
0,have been a patient here for my over 6 years however the many of the old doctors have retired and their spots have been filled with qualified but uncaring doctorsi made an appointment with the hospital several weeks prior to look at my arm which i believed to be fractured or splintered at the bone  two days before my appointment a itchy bacterial rash spread across my back  on appointment day i was told that i would have to choose between getting a prescription for the infection spreading across my back or them looking at my arm  of course the rash took precedence at the time so 5 minutes and one small little piece of paper after my appointment started i was shuffled out the door--arm still in extreme pain unacknowledged and ignored by the doctorword of advice: if scheduling an appointment here do not schedule with dr luis m irizarry  he doesn't care about anything but herding cattle in and out the door so he can make as much money as possible in a given day
0,rebbelke is the worst doctor ever very rude and suggests hippy alternatives no one goes to doctors for hippy alternatives front staff also pushed multiple people in front of me extending my wait to an hour past my appointment time why bother having appointments if your walk ins get priority
0,moved to phoenix needed a physical for my insurance company for the new year - only required blood pressure height weight and cholesterol  dr walter kmiecik not only required me to schedule a follow up visit in order to get the form completed (two office visits for one form) but he ordered every single blood test imaginable which cost me $400 in lab work not required by my insurance company  then to top it off in the follow up appointment he proceeded to act genuinely disappointed when he found that my health was excellent and he couldnt bilk me for more "medical care" i didn't need   this is a crooked dishonest practice and i would not recommend anyone patronizing them particularly dr walter kmiecik
0,am not going back there after getting a second consultation i found out that they made a completely wrong diagnosis and they wanted to drug me with too many useless over-the-counter medicaments the place is also very squeezy
0,must say i am very disappointed with the way it's establishment is ran we had a group of kids (7) some with experience and some not then they put 3 adults in the adult kart and ran all over the kids and ran almost 36 sec faster not a safe experience for the younger kids
0,the management my husband decided to take me there for a suprise we arrvied there around 2 pm on a sunday to a very empty parking lot we arrived inside to find a large party there was no direction for someone who has never been there on top of that the party had stragglers filter in so of course they nonchalantly cut in line because they were there for the party it should not work that way we found a mix of 2 lines where we had no idea where we were supposed to be after standing in line for an hour the couple in front of us approached the counter to find out there was a 2 hour wait for a race we didn't even wait to get to the counter before we said enough of this there was no management around and found the laziness of the employees we were disappointed in this place but it's not really like one complaints going to hurt this i just hope they learn how to be more effective at their operations and their customer service you can train employees how to facilitate operations and when groups are known to come in have them have a specific point of contact so the rest of us don't have to suffer for because we're not in their group
0,i have let this "cool off" for more then a month so as to not write from anger or disappointment for those that are looking into this school you must already have an idea of the price$$$ wanting to attend this school for more then 20 years my bride gave this to me as a birthday gift we found these "so called gift certificates" on ebay they were roughly 13 off retail price "if i would have any idea how complicated this was going to get i'd gladly paid retail when i called to book a seat at the bondurant school i was transferred to the sales dept i fully explained that i was going to purchase tickets online i wanted to ensure the "gift certificates" were in fact authentic i was told the were current and valid i asked to reserve a seat in an upcoming class then i even offered to use a credit card to hold the seat i was told that "it wouldn't be a problem to reserve the class seat" i then asked for a recommendation for local lodging i was told "we are running a special lodging deal" those that attended this class were to have the hotel rooms comp'd great i thoughtuntil the following week i called and got the same person on the phone to ask a different question regarding the class when i was told "oh there is a problem" i asked about what this person explained 2 separate issues first another sales person had sold the last seat for the class that i had already made all the travel arrangements for second was that the hotel was not to be included in the price due to the "gift certificates" this is when i was informed that "they are gift certificates we don't make any money on them" i was not happy as stated i tried to secure the class seat with a credit card the week prior to making travel arrangements i was told that the person would "try and figure out a way to fix it" i canceled all travel and was contacted it a few days by the sales person i was told that i was going to be able to attend the scheduled date and upgraded to a corvette the main reason for pulling the trigger on the class was because i has recently bought a 2011 camaro ss and wanted to drive that car i made that clear from the first contact regarding scheduling a class seat there is more but frankly i don't feel like going back over all of it after not being able to offer anything to compensate me for all of their errors i decided to confront the general sales manager with a copy of all electronic correspondence regarding all of the issues from the beginning in the middle of the main entrance of the facility and in front of an employee i was told "i'm not getting into a battle of emails" then slammed the door as they left leaving me to answer to the employee when stated " what just happened" i explained that the sales manager was busy after gaining my composure i went and found the same person and asked to see mr bondurant i was told that he was not on the property and would not return for the day i told this person i would be expecting a phone call from mr bondurant asap due to the flight i had reserved for home i could not wait"wait for it" the next day i receive a phone call from the legend bob bondurant the first words from his mouth were "i'm pretty pissed off right now" i was    floored to say the least     after several different people chimed in on the speaker phone i just gave in after spending thousands of dollars and going to a "bucket list item" i had no come back for a person i had looked up to for decades i had upset him well the dust has settled and i thought it was time to speak my own opinion to this tragedy there is so much more to this event that i have not listed the irony to this whole thing is that due to my job i attend many events that the bondurant's do as well i look foreword to seeing them very sooncheers
0,received a gift certificate valued at $2500 and booking a date was a hassle i understand you have to book 3 months in advance and i'm ok with that after calling and waiting to be re-directed to the "right person" 4 times i was sent to a voice mail where i left a message and expected a call back no return call this went on for weeks the gift certificate has an expiration date and i wasn't able to get a hold of "the right person" through the phone what a waste of a gift
0,took my family here for a birthday party for a friends child overall-the kids had a blast it was very cold and windy so i didn't see my kids wristbands until their hour and a half was up and we went inside when i went to take the wristband off my 3 year old daughter i discovered that the girl had put it on so tight that it literally cut and bruised her wrist it took 3 of us to get it off needless to say i was pretty upset i took my daughter up front where about 10 employees were standing in a circle chatting i showed them her wrist and one girl asked who did it i didn't remember so i told them whose party we were attending the girl i believe her name was missy said it was her and in a very unconcerned tone said " sorry about that" my friend went up several minutes later and spoke to them again including the manager she said she got the same reaction-not a lot of concern or sympathy i called and spoke with both owners ken and jerry both apologized but didn't seem too concerned i realize they couldn't change what happened however knowing a 3 year old was left with cuts and bruises from a wristband because of one of their employees i expected a little more concern and empathy if i had done this to a child i would feel so awful and do whatever i could to make the child and her parents feel better and know i was remorseful i really felt like the employee and the owners were annoyed that i was bringing it to their attention i don't feel they had any remorse whatsoever
0,just purchased $80 worth of wrist bands for the rides before i could get on a ride with my baby an unsupervised child pushed me & baby out the way security was not concerned with me almost falling with a baby but more focused on a profanity that i said do not want to spend my money anywhere that isn't concerned about my child's safety
0,workers here are really rude and mean when ordering food the cashier did not know what she was doing asked another coworker and called her "fcking stupid" my little 8 year old cousin asked to get her 284 tickets she won from a game but the workers refused and just gave her four tokens backhow rude she worked hard for this tickets this is suppose to be a family oriented place but turns out it ain't never coming back tbh
0,a pretty fun place when not completely  packed but i came here today to celebrate my brothers birthday and the place was practically empty aside from our small group and they didn't bother to turn on the music  nor did they even open the rides blaming the weather  no rain aside from the girls who brought us our drinks and pizza the rest of the staff was brand spanking new and far from friendly or talkative they have a scan qr that seems you get free tokens upon downloading their app so i did just that and apparently they have to give you another code to scan to unlock that which they couldn't find i saw they had another code there too for a free slice of pizza and a drink  so i scanned the one code they did have and when i asked the new girl if i could redeem this one while i was at it her manager which she called over again  who was very rude and accusing me of trying to use a code twice luckily the other girl there who let me scan and unlock the pizza code said i had just done it he reluctantly gave the green for it this place is poorly managed and gives off a very dead vibe you'd think they'd be nicer to their only paying costumes i won't be coming back again
0,not goto this place****i came here to celebrate a bachelor party with a group of 9 guys and we signed up for the mini grand prix (3 races)  in the first race 2 karts broke down 1 kart went only half speed and my own kart had a sticky gas pedal with a broken steering wheel brace  most of the karts didn't have functioning seat belts eitherso after the first race they tell our group that they only have 5 functioning karts left and that we'd have to split our group up even though i made a reservation in advance and they guaranteed us we'd all be able to race together  you'd think they'd have some backup karts  anyways we demanded a refund right there and then but the managers and owners absolutely refused to talk to me even over the phone  they told their own staff that the invoice for the reservation stated "no refunds" but they never sent me an invoice  i called the day before to remind them to send me the invoice again but they failed to do so  for the next 2 hours our group argued with the administrative staff who claimed they could do nothing to help us without manager consent  i had the admin there pull up their copy of the invoice that was never emailed to me and even their copy said nothing about "no refunds"the staff there kept calling their managers and eventually even the managers stopped picking up their phone calls  how shady is thatbottom line: stay away from this place
0,place sucks  the kart i had went about 10 mph not the claimed "50 mph" on their website  the kart was so slow i was able to drive around the entire track full throttle and one handed while maintaining my line  people were lapping me and it was pretty disappointing  what made it more disappointing was that they said there was nothing they could do because only 4 or 5 karts were operational so some of us were stuck using karts with known problems  they wouldn't even give me a refund after this ordeal  i do not recommend this place  highly unprofessional and unsatisfied
0,awful personnel were helpful but the service was terrible owner is not responsible at all he lacks ownership qualities when it comes to dealing with people was not respondent  also note that there is no refund even though they don't tell you beforehand cars are liable to break down at anytime without notice and there cars about five years old would highly suggest not to even give this place a try your better off going elsewhere
0,you know anything about go-karting do not go there for one the staff was very rude don't acknowledge you upon arrival not even the manager the rules were not enforced at all they put you in a room where they just say watch this video where people just walked out to the track just to ignore it nobody makes sure you watch the video just leave you in a room that you can easily walk out on the track there was just one guy not caring at all that was happening on the track not knowing what he was supposed to do flags weren't used when trying to pass he walked off at times mid-race more focused on a girl  he used the yellow flag which means caution to end the race instead of the checkered my sister spun out and i passed her 4 laps before he came back and realized she was out of the race did i mention the go-karts were horrible this is my 5th go-kart place and by far the worst i've been to if you have kart experience do not come here
0,went this last weekend bought it through grouponand i have to say my family felt like we were imposing on them i called to see if there needed to be reservation and the gal that answered was very short and it almost sounded like she was trying to discourage us to goonce we arrived we walked into a small lobby and the same gal that answered the phone was the  receptionist and she didn't bother to look up in greeting or greet us rather she was quite rude and said "what" she wasn't very anything except rude spoke under her breath and yelled at people so beware of the receptionist with two surface piercing on her collar bone we weren't given any direction with anything just kind of wondered through we had to wait 3 hours for our first lap and they seem to have forgotten our party one of the employee was smoking while working and walked out to help move a go kart that was stuck with his cigarette in hand my dad and my boyfriend didn't have a seat belt well there was straps but no where to click them into no safety enforced no instruction and no customer service overall it was horrible we paid for three races and a year membership we only did two and the only reason we did the second was we went up and asked why its taking them another 2 hours to get our second race in and when we inquired about the year membership no one knew what that was and no one cared really
0,gokart experience of my life the lady at the front is nice cool but after that is completely unprofessional  they leave you in a room to watch a short instructional video which is complete shit they state the obvious like ok red is stop green is go dont press them at the same time blah blah  they also tell you about what flags mean which is usefully if they actually use them  the management inside at the track is horrible the entire time i was there they were on their cell phones or playing with their man tits  i watched two races go by and as people had spun out waited patiently with their hands raised waiting for assistance the track workers sat there with their hand down their pants on their phone the customer sat there waiting for two laps as for the rest be prepared for uneven cars lack of flag uses  bumping go for it they dont give a shit slow drivers waste your time behind them they dont care gutless karts this is your place anyone who has ever been to a gokart place knows this place sucks never going again
0,reasons to avoid this place1  the website says "fast lap races are a true ten minutes on the track"  --  this is a lie  we timed all 3 races and each was 65 minutes on the button  what a rip off2  the website says "the karts are equipped with honda 200cc engines which can reach speeds up to 50 mph"  --  this is a lie  the karts there are all old and beat to - well they're bad except for 3 of them that actually ripped around that nasty old warehouse at speeds up to 50 mphbiggest lie coming up3  the website says "our building's are equipted with state of the art professionally engineered exhaust system's that change the air in our building every 4 to 5 minutes" -- this is a lie like none other  if by state of the art you mean 4 garage doors that are open then yes your professionally engineered exhaust system is top notch  my buddy and i had serious issues with our throats buring after being in that warehouse for over an hour (kona grill's happy hour helped wash down the 4 stroke exhaust that had coated our esophagus - thx kona)the on track staff is terrbily unprofessional  the protective jump-suits and gloves are all worn with holes and missing zippersvelcro  i'll never go back there and that's coming from a guy with a stack of "buy one race get one free" cardssigh
0,place sucks we showed up and were told the wait would be an hour and a half since there were 20 of us we were told we could return in 25 hours and race guaranteed we found the nearest bar and upon return we're told it would be another 15 hour wait lame so we left and they lost out on $1000  the girl at the desk sucks on getting and keeping business for this place make sure you have reservations and still plan on waiting 2 hours
0,i could give zero stars i would we waited for a loooooong time and were told we would have to wait another hour if we wanted to race i should've know better when we showed up and a family was grumbling as they were walking out turns out the same thing happened to them i can't comment on the carts because we decided we had spent enough of our vacation waiting so we left i will say that the neighborhood is horrible and i wouldn't want my kids anywhere near there unsupervised save your money and spend it somewhere that knows what customer service is
0,never go here  very unorganized  i went in with a group with groupons to get on the track i understand that we cannot make reservations for a groupon but the idiot lady told me that we would wait 2 hours and we can get on we did wait 2 hours then she said another hour  we were visiting vegas not there to sit in their garage for 3 hours we even tried to compromise and say alright then just give us one of the three races we are entitled to one of the worst experiences i ever had i usually never rate a business a one because things happen but this lady just made me frustrated i hope the owner reads this and fires her because she is hurting your business
0,review is based on their mini-golf and that alone everything else looked pretty useless as well but the mini-golf was an absolute joke they had 3 courses to choose from and all three were very poorly designed and run down like the place has been around for 20+ years if you want a real mini-golf experience i suggest going to castles and coasters
0,golf review: course in bad condition - sunken greens torn and worn astroturf gravel on greens beat up carpet pretty crappy bathrooms disgusting there must be something better in area
0,bad experience  we prepaid for several batting cage tis and were told that we could use some the next day if we needed to  my 9 year old was hit by a wild pitch and we left  we returned the next day in spite of the mishap and were told by jason that we could not use our prepaid tickets from the day beforetheir operations director was not available tospeak to mesharee swanderthe place is very run down many of the games don't work and the overall environment is very dirty so bring your gloves to keep away from the germswe also learned that someone had been seriously burned at the go kart trackugh
0,played 2 of the mini golf courses  both were in terrible shape  in my opinion they should close until they spend some money on the courses  one hole had a dirt hole dug in it about6 inches wide 4 inches deep
0,this place has really gone downhill this used to be a well maintained fun place to go when i was in high school we revisited last week and it was a totally different experiencebatting cages were fun nets over the cages were torn so hopefully you're not parked on the other side of them $150 for 18 pitches driving range looked like it was in decent condition but we didn't partakenow come the negatives--the mini-golf course was a joke holes in fake boulders missing turf cement lumps no water no decorations no nothin horrible by about hole 5 we were over it and were trying to find our way off the course we go back to the window to see if we can do something to make up for the crappiness that was just experienced manager comes to the window and has a horrendous attitude seriously we didn't ask for refunds we asked if we could do something else to make up for the shoddy course not even an option he was rude and demanded receipts and cards--refunds given (and appreciated)bathrooms were also pretty disgusting certainly won't be going back
0,i'd give no stars however it won't let me  no where on the website did it indicate a closure at 4 pm today 121212 when we arrived an employee told us that they were closing on short notice and then said the sign had been up for a weekas tourists visiting from out of town i would expect a notification on the website  i am disappointed ( my five year old sorely so) that we were unable to do go karts with himmy advice to the management: please post closures on your website  there are five year olds that count on that information  thank you
0,place needs a makeover  out of date and very dim golf at night  putt putt courses are lamerun down and needs upkeep
0,horrible  we were lied to by all the staff the cashier treated us poorly and called u liars and the wait which we were told would only be 1hr quickly went to 3 hours and when we check on our status a fourth time we were told it would still be another hour  the staff are rude and treat everyone as if they are stupid and below them  we would never recumbent this place to anyone
0,had an extremely unpleasant experience at my recent visit to pole poistion raceway my boyfriend and i have been looking forward to our trip to las vegas for a long time pole position being one of our top prioritiesunfortunately the faculty were less than friendly especially the boys running the track area there were 4 people ejected from my race for accidentally running into barriers these cars are extremely powerful and fast and for someone who has never driven one before it is easy to get out of control being a beginner myself i was the first person to crash and was threatened to be ejected and spoken to like i was a dumb child who had never driven a car before this was demoralizing not to mention embarrassing being that these boys yelling at me we're younger than myselfafter my crash i could hear the boys running the track area saying that their groups of racers were 'stupid' today listen boys if you don't like your job get a new one i felt it would have helped to do a slow practice run around the track before each race being that there are several accident prone areas that come up quickly to someone like me who has never raced the track beforemy disappointment in pole position has caused me to recommend  not going there and i myself my boyfriend and our friend who went with us will not return either
0,was visiting vegas with some friends when i checked this place out i've been to quite a few go karting places and this was one of the worst the track is too small for 12-13 karts at the same time also the race managers are not consistent about who they stop for crashing into other karts or the wallsit seems that "regulars" get the preference give this place a miss
0,a groupon coupon  and was treated as a bother rather than being helpful i would not recommend this place
0,place would be awesome if it would regulate guest who do not follow rules at the beginning they give you instructions problem is especially for those who abuse the pull to the side passing rule are not removed this company prosecutes customers who are their to have fun and race hard they allow those who refuse to abide by the racing rules to continue because they want their money find another place to race because if you have any interest in having fun expect the employees to ignore those who refuse to abide by the rules that make this place fun
0,pricey  one kid ride is $27 and only lasts 10 minutes  they do not do refunds and customers do not come first  would never come back
0,place was totally empty and they still would not allow me to race with my son said it was corporate policy on weekends we will never be back as i don't do business with stupid companies hopeful the business that replaces pole position after it closes will uses more intelligence
0,and time again is place seems to have inconsistencies with their policies when we showed up today we saw the "text club" advertisement i texted the club and got an offer for a free race as soon as you take it up to redeem they tell you it's not good today because it's a weekend there's nothing in the text that says it's not valid on weekends (see photo of the text below) it's poor management to offer customers free stuff and not post a disclaimer
0,place is very dangerous when there are lots of drivers and there usually is not worth a severe neck and back injury i had a  guy plow into me after the race and the kicker they serve alcohol so there are drunks racing with you
0,might of been able to write a review had i been able to use the batting cages its tuesday 715pm i came here to get a few practice swings in since its the closest place to my house and walked inside and waited for someone to get tokens and rent a bat but no one came i walked to the consession stand and again no one there i walked around and waited for another 15 min so after 25 min of just standing and waiting and not a single person came out i decided to leave i should of listened to everyone on my team and stayed away from here they all said what a joke of a place this is and i gotta say i agree with them won't be back and unless ur into coming to a batting cage to just stare at it i would suggest u stay away away too
0,read the other review and was shocked because my experience was very different yes the temple is clean and open for business but polite and open the priest was not  i would say people from other faiths sure don't feel welcome when it's only the priest present  the current temple priest who performed my wedding (i married an hindu) was rude rude rude (had i known this was how it was going to go down i would have used the priest from bharatiya ekta mandir of arizona)  sadly we only met in-person (my fiance had several phone conversations the months leading up to out wedding) with the priest the week before our wedding and it was perfectly obvious that he disliked me and my lack of hindi  i attempted to ask question to better understand the ceremony but that just got me scowls and grumbles  the day of our wedding the priest was not ready and was acting as if he had forgotten about the ceremony andor the deposit we made  finally after the ceremony when it was time to sign the marriage certificate he asked (actually demanded) an additional $300 to sign the certificate  of course we agreed- what were we to do  i am pretty sure that would be called extortion and why hadn't he simply told us before the ceremony  i am guessing because he is a thief
0,place is overpriced and the service is not good at all  when we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables  one almost hit our child  another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there  the cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired  not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby  our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush  we will not be back  also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card  please get up with the times
0,i had the misfortune of getting a pizza from bishops it was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time needless to say i won't be getting one again i got a pepperoni and sausage pizza the pizza was bland  tasteless crust tasted like frozen pizza crust the sauce was meh cheese was okay sausage was disgusting bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage i don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting i don't recommend getting a pizza from bishops
0,have bought it in a store" hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn  totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out  no one gave us a bill and i had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money  didn't even get a "thanks" with my changeso not worth the walk that we took to get here
0,had heard about klavon's for some time but never found myself in that area of the strip  the day i did i did not hesitate to enter and taste the ice cream that had such excellent reviews firstly i discovered that there was new management they definitely did not appear happy to see me enter i was met with hostile stares i approached and told them i had heard many good things about this store and its wares no breaking of the ice i ordered and was given a scoop of ice cream the size of a golf ball for four dollars  save your money and time
0,service i have never been treated so poorly in a cafe the coffee wasn't spectacular and it was fairly expensive for what it was head down to starbucks or the coffee beanery
0,see people sitting in jitters' chairs outside all the time and i like the decor so i really really want to like this place but the first time was the last time the service was horrible and their coffee didn't taste great i waited for ten minutes at least before the two people manning the cashierbar before i was paid attention to and serviced as they were busy chatting with one of their friends who had stopped in after getting my coffee they were low on the sugars and milks and other fix-ins so was not pleased even further especially for what i paid for a small coffee
0, i was on my way to johnny burritos when i saw their sign of "specials"  i stopped in and ordered the cream of potato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich  both were awful  the soup had the consistency of milk and not much flavor  it's no where close to "cream of" anything   the cheese on the sandwich was so thin that i pried it open just to ensure myself that they hadn't only given me 2 pieces of plain bread  i like to support small mom and pop businesses so i really wanted to like this place  maybe i just ordered the wrong thing but it was so off-putting that i don't plan to ever return  next time i'll keep walking to johnny burritos
0,place is gross they did an okay job but the whole place smelled horrible and looked really dirty i don't know why the reviews are so high except for these people must have never gone to a clean nail salon
0,suzie was very rushed about 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile this is the worst my nails have looked
0,assume this place got so many good ratings thanks to the insentive of a 10% discountdark red gel manicure applied by the gentleman with long pointy fingernails ended up blotchy and looking messy plus got cut twice once it bledouch dont recommendi won't return
0,and hasty i always base whether or not to get a full setmanicure by the way they care for my feet  i was greeted and promised "10 more minutes" i sat and soaked for 15 min before a man who looked like he just built a house (dirty white shirt and dirty nails) start my pedicure  long story short the shape of my nails were crooked  he forgot to put lotion on my feet and talked sh*t about me in vietnamese the whole time about me being too picky while the entire staff made bets on whether or not if i was going to leave a tipi paid and left the man a tip anyway i've never been so appalled  humiliated and dissatisfied with a service i asked for the manager and there was no manager avail
0,haircut i've ever had what a waste of $55 now i have to pay another $50 to go somewhere else and get it fixed i am so upset i was clear about what i wanted brought several photos i was looking for a long bob and ended up leaving the salon looking like johnny depp's willy wonkai asked for shouder iength and my hair is way shorter than i asked so upsetting and then feeling forced to add gratuity because the person who gave you the terrible cut is standing at the counter watching you pay awful cut and awful experience unless you're looking for a simple trim that you could do yourself do not go to this salon
0,was in today and was cut by the callous removal tool on my ankle during a pedicure it bled and stung and was not pretty i was compensated by a 10% discount() this is not how i would do business if i wanted to retain a brand new customer whom i just cut a chunk of skin off their ankle ouch good thing i didnt have an event tonight and had to wear heels horrible service
0,went to this salon on saturday 111911 because of a positive review on yelp but don't think i'll go to them again the atmosphere was extremely subdued the lighting was dim and the young lady i had was nice enough but you could tell she was not happy to be there plus she made comments to that effect they did not have a lot of choices in regular polish which were not organized 90% of the gels were glittered which btwhas chipped already my pedicure upon home inspection is poorly done with huge gaps and i'm not in love with the colordidn't have much to choose from ps by monday 112811 i managed to peel off all my gel polish
0,royally screwed up my nail beds she filed so much there were deep red ridges in my nail beds and it really hurt i knew what that meant so i tested her and asked what those red lines were and she told me it was just my nail regrowth and it's totally normal i can't believe she's telling clients this who don't really know i'm now seeing someone else (stacey at just for you at mcclintock and warner) who has now been doing my nails for 8 months and my nails are healthy againi contacted nailspa expose on facebook (even included pictures of the damages) and the only thing they could offer me was a nail strengthening polish and a discount on my next service you really think i'll be back for another service after my nail beds have been royally f*cked up i will never recommend this place please research and know about who's doing your nails if they have a current license how long they've been doing nails etc
0,there 123011 very disappointed with service i had yes i said had gel nails and ended up with acrylics the first girl that i sat down with couldn't figure out how to do my pink and white gel nails the wanted to polish on the gel and i kept telling her that it was the gel in the small jars  she ended up passing me off to a guy who put acrylics on my nails i won't be going back ever  what a joke
0,used to love this place and had been a regular client for nearly 2 years however they have forever lost my business went in for gel manicurepedicure took forever and i had to rush out to get to another commitment later that evening i was called and told that they made a mistake and had undercharged me the girl went silent  waiting for my response i was shocked that they were calling to ask me to come back i explained that i was leaving to go out of town the next day and she asked where i currently was and if i could come back that night could not believe the nerve when i got back from town i received an additional call when you make the mistake you eat the cost i can't think of anything more tacky than telling an existing client who has spent hundreds of dollars at your business to come back and pay horrible business practice  never going back and will tell others not to waste their time or money at a business that treats clients this way
0,and short it is not that complicated i was unfortunately very disappointed they tried to get me in and out in 10 minutes like really   they tried to just and file my nails and not cut them after she was done and asked if i liked i asked if she was going to shorten my nails and she started clipping them with a cuticle cutter basically i would never come back and would not recommend anyone to go here
0,went to this place because of their good reviews here on yelpim honestly wondering if i went to the wrong placei called 15 minutes before me and my mom headed inthey said they would be able to take us both right awayonce we got there we waited 15 minutes before they even started my moms full setthen i had to wait another 10 minutes for them to start my manicurewhy does it seem like all nail places do this if you cant take me right away when i ask please dont lie just to get me to come therei got white tips and im not too impressed there are bubbles all through their top coat and the guy couldnt even cutfile my nails evenlyi definitely will not be backwish i could give zero stars
0,went there because of the high reviews on yelp i'm hoping next time someone sees thisrun awaayyyyyyy this place blows i wanted to get a full set of acrylics with pink tips and i explained this and pointed out the tip on the display so the technician knew exactly what i wanted i had gone with my friend and we were bouncing around future nail ideas and the technician decides to listen to only part of our conversation and just starts doing something else to my nails based on part of what he heard eavesdropping without even asking mebefore i realized what he was doing he ended up cutting my cuticle so badly we had to use the human version of "quik-stop" on my cuticle to stop the bleeding it was cut so bad he did this while using the tool that looks like sharp pliers to remove dead cuticle skin i don't get my nails done a lot so i didn't know he wasn't doing tips anymore like i asked he tried to give me a full manicure with a gel coating over the whole nail no tips without even asking me he got far enough that i had to just have him take off the mess he made so i could just leave since i had work later he tried to get me to stay and he tried to tell me that after he filed off the gel coat he had applied and then properly got the tips on it takes 40 minutes to an hour after that to put a gel coat on i understand if the whole procedure; filing putting on tips putting on gel coats that can take 40 minutes to an hour just a top gel coat not that long of a procedure he took off the mess he made and i left i had work to get to and its rare i get a day off where i have time to do this he wasted my time he didn't ever communicate with me and he took stupid liberties that cost us both i would not ever go back
0,reason for the one star rating is the way they treat their employees (and customers)  one woman wanted to pay with her credit card they gave her some grief about it then took it but kept $1 out of the tip to pay for the credit card transaction  then the ownermanager (who was doing my nails at the time) pulled out her bill to show the customer how much she gets charged per credit card transaction  the customer was like uh ok don't need show and tell here really  the owner kept saying how this is america nothing is free the customer should know that  then once that customer left the owner continued ranting to me and showing me the bill  i'm not sure which shocked me more--that she fought with the customer so much or short shifted her employee because the customer used a credit card  either way they could have given me the best manicure ever (they didn't) and i sitll wouldn't go back  too much bad juju here
0,place was awful i was using the groupon so i had to call to make a reservation for my friend and i as soon as i told the receptionist that i would be using the groupon she tried to hang up on me i told her she hadn't asked for my name yet and she hurriedly asked what it was and hung up fast forward 2 weeks later and big surprise she had not written my name or my friend's name down for our reservation luckily it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and i sit in her chairs worst mistake ever she started off very friendly; however i noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set as soon as i told her this she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails false advertising much she then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would "look bad" after trying to convince her that i indeed wanted white nails she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails worst quality ever there were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish she seemed very annoyed that i asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail when she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle i went through) the lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that i wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that i was wrong she then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off she said she would have to charge her $3 for removing her nail polish her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac it was regular nail polish for goodness sakes as she was doing her nails this lady kept muttering "oh my god" underneath her breath and did the worst job ever on both of our nails we would have just gotten up and walked out except we had already purchased our groupon this was the worst nail experience i've ever had do not go to magen nail
0,really had high hope for the groupon for 2 for 1 gel or shellac manicure let's just say i won't be returning
0,used to go to magen nail salon with my old roommate and thought it was okay (nothing great but not terrible)  the nail salon is definitely outdated and in use of a renovation but i could look over that  the last time i went to magen's was the last  i had to have her shorten my nails twice because she didn't go it right the first time  no biggie  i did have a hang nail on one toe that she decided she needed to rip out  it was pretty painful and definitely drew blood  no apology  the best part of this all is that my toe was inflamed and really tender for over two weeks  very unprofessional and i will never be back
0,i had a really terrible experience at this salon i was excited to try a new place for a great price (with a gel manicure groupon) however when i got to the salon the lady redeemed my groupon on my phone and then immediately claimed no such thing happened i saw her press the button with my very eyes and genuinely thought this was a bad joke after i showed her she redeemed it she started arguing with me saying i need to pay again that my groupon was invalid and basically accusing me of stealing i was horrified she then proceeded to turn to  her coworkers and very obviously talk about me   it was the most appalling customer service i have ever seen she went on to make me pay full price for my manicure even though i had a legitimate groupon i would have left immediately had my friend (who also had a groupon) was not already inside my friend was serviced by a different gentleman and did not have any  problems she also simply showed her phone to the person pressed redeem and went on to get a manicure in peace we were both extremely appalled at their behavior and the terrible treatment of a new customer  i am never going back
0,i'm writing this review after going to this place about 4 times it is conveniently located near my house so having just moved here i thought id give it a shot since my regular nail place was in tempe marketplace and i felt lazy to go there that day first time i got a pedi and full set and had no issues i did notice the quality was lower than the job they had done at my other place but i was ok with it that particular day they were busy and i think her son and bf were both helping out it's a family business which i think is great second time was a fill and pedi she seemed to be n a rush and my nails were all sloppy and the clear coat wasn't covering the whole nail some nails weren't even and  just a sloppy job she asked me who had done my nails i told her she had (the owner)third time i went in same thing the girl doing my pedi n french tip couldn't get it right they were all uneven and almost looked like they used whiteout for the tips messy when the owner started doing my nails she noticed i kept looking at my toes and she offered to take a look after my nails were done well again she saw the sloppy work from the previous time and again asked me who had done my nails i told her it was her  she finished and again same thing nails not even clear coat not covering entire nail and bumps all over i hate complaining so i just asked she looked at my toes which she did and had the girl redo them i felt bad i came back a couple days later cause i broke a nail and i mentioned to her about the clear coat and i showed her and she fixed it she also fixed my broke nail and it looked weird cause she did it (again) like always in a hurry and it was not as wide as the other nails whatever i left i went back yesterday (111813) and she meets me at door saying "oh we too busy" it's only three of them working and i was like "ok" (sounded like she was telling me to go) i said it's ok i can wait  well i should've left i decided to get my toenails red that's how bad i didn't want the girl to try doing the french tip i never paint my toe nails red ever then (the owner) started looking at my nails and she again asked me who had done them cause they didn't look good and asked why that broken nail she had fixed wasn't as wide as the others i told her it was herself and she shut up she honestly seems to be very very lazy and always always in a hurry i'm not the type of person that complains but i don't like telling u how to do your job either cause i don't like others telling me how to do mine but this time i had had it i asked her to fix several things and then she puts the clear coat and tells me to put my hands n the dryer thingy once my nails were done i pull them out and she files the edges a bit and she damages one of the nails n the side taking off the clear coat i tell her and she said "oh u did it when u out ur hand down" she was still holding my hand  and then i asked her about three other nails not fully covered with clear coat  she reapplied and after 2 mins n the dryer thing she said i was done i looked at my nails and she could see i was upset  because she just reapplied clear on too of the other clear that wasn't even dry there's bumps and u can see the ridges of the little brush  i was supposed to get my eyebrows done but i was scared she would just wax it all off so i told her never mind as i'm paying she sees i'm not happy cause i keep looking at my nails and she says "u ok i fix for u" i said "don't worry about it" i paid left no tip and walked out i wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but not anymoreher work is very very very sloppy she is always is a hurry and always understaffed i would never recommend this place to anyone cause they will be very unhappy with her work i wished she had more pride n what she does being n the customer service field i know that when i'm with a customer that's my only customer and i concentrate n them and only them to rush and have a bad product or service is just not good business if u go there be ready to wait at least 30 minutes before being seen
0,turns away business at 415 in the afternoon and hands you a coupon to come back another day  lol this place  don't think so too many nail places around here won't be coming back here
0,i could give 0 stars i would they ruined my nails and made the edges of them all bleed by her nails i will never go here again i hope they go out of business cause of how rude and disrespectful they are
0,to get a quick full and had my mails butchered by the older woman "laura" she burned me 4 times on my right hand and proceeded to rip off my thumb nail i pulled away and ask for someone else to do it not from here but needed a quick fill overall got another woman to get done what i needed will never come back here again
0,zero concern for client safety state board needs to be warned of this place this place deserves negative stars they burned the top and side of my foot with callous remover i have abrasions on my foot that are still there a week later i am unable to wear shoes or even flip flops because of the pain the side of my foot also blistered up they use unsafe practices and then tried to blame me for having sensitive skin i went to nail school and have used various callous removers safely on myself and others i do not have sensitive skin
0,place is a joke my friend and i went in for gel services they let us choose from the templates funny thing is neither one of us got what we paid for they did not match -why even offer the templates we will never go back
0,really really hate leaving bad reviews but sometimes they are well-deserved  the only positive thing i can say is that the ladies who work here are nice  what was not nice is the completely jacked up gel nails i got when i stopped here on a whim when my regular lady at luxury nails was booked  the bed of each of my nails had crazy white streaks all over when she was finished when i pointed it out and asked what the heck it was she acted like there was nothing there  it was really noticeable so i don't know why she thought this was the best way to handle itthen the entire staff came over and examined my nails and the lady who seemed like the owner explained that it was my crappy real nails  yes  i have crappy real nails which is why i get gel in the first place  but i have never had this happen and i've had gel nails for months  the suggestion was for me to have each of my nails buffed down to paper thin status and re-apply the gel  this was done with only some improvement  i left with my nails looking like complete garbage  they are not even filed right so even if i was going to buy the argument that this little situation is somehow the fault of my genetics it does not explain not even filing the ends properly  do not go here for gel nails
0,owners of these place should pay more attention of how some workers act very  disrespectful to the clients very bad service and too much ego from upthight worker specially the big asian guy
0,shop does not even warrant a rating i called on a monday morning explained to the guy on the phone that i was looking for a new nail lady i made an appointment with the owner jennifer on tuesday evening for a gel manicure when i arrived on time she comes out then passes me off to someone else said she was too busy which she had no clients and was just sitting there i explained my previous bad experience at another salon and she said victoria would take good care of me victoria was nice and my nails looked decent when i left not 24hrs passed and three nails chipped then i went back wednesday night and showed jennifer the nails she said she would fix then passed me to another lady who proceeded to drill my nail to remove all the gel i told her to stop and explained it was soak off gel the lady did not understand jennifer identified the commotion then came over i explained the drill and she told the girl i was so frustrated at this point and jennifer finally agreed to correct and work on me i told her to forget it and i would do it myself all my nails broke and chipped i was so disappointed with the experience i had i am a loyal customer and just wanted quality service i will never patronize this store ever and would advise anyone seeking quality to look else where
0,hate writing bad reviews but i wasn't very impressed with this place for the prices they charge :( all was not lost though since i had printed out a coupon from their website for 20% off the pedicure stations don't have massage chairs and i didn't think my manicure was as clean and nice as it could have been the lady who did my nails was super nice but i don't think i'll be returning to total bliss unless it's for a different kind of service
0,was given a $200 gift certificate here from my sister with no expiration date according to the arizona state statutes an expiriation date must cleary be disclosed on the certificate however total bliss said that their policy is 1 year and will not honor my certificate
0,i went here for an appointment with anastasia for gel and glitter i waited patiently and ended up with an appointment with a completely different person than what i was told i was going to see i asked her i wanted gel with glitter and she had no idea what i was talking about she said she can do gel polish with glitter in it but not any type of loose glitter with gel the lady they gave me only does regular acrylic nails and was even too afraid to do the glitter as she didn't know what she was doing finally another lady said that she can do it but that i would need to wait a moment until she's finished with the appointment i waited a half an hour and finally saw the lady i did not realize that she was pushing me in between her appointment and she did it very quickly maybe lasted about 20 minutes i have never had my nails done that only takes 20 minutes she ended up using a shellac gel instead of an actual gel builder and it was very clumpy and uneven to were you could see a dip in the middle of each of my nails the only reason i'm giving it any stars is that the owner was very apologetic and tried to accommodate the situation but i was disappointed also i had went there with a spa finder gift card i had $10 left instead of just taking the money off of that card and giving me the card to go somewhere else the receptionist traded it for a total bliss card this now forces me to have to go back to them just use the rest of the card
0,was the worst least professional spa service i've ever received the girl waxing my brows talked at me the entire time so much so that i wondered whether or not she could possibly be focusing on what she was doing after 15 minutes spewing out of a partial life story and some pretty horrific gum smacking inches from my face (all on her parth ha) my brows were "done" they were decently shaped (nothing special) but the clean up was atrocious i had errant hairs that i had to request my esthetician pluck and she did (while i stood up) however when i got home i still had to clean up myself bad bad bad and it cost twice as much as any perfectly decent salon wax i wish i'd had something even near the experience other yelpers have had
0,having experiences from laura and lisa from the brow lady and awesome customer experience from both of them i am now sad to say nothing here is the same as it was before on my last visit i was scheduled with sharmeita (someone who had only been hired two days prior to my brow wax) while she did an amazing job with my eyebrows she lacked in customer service she pretty much did everything wrong you could do while in a customer service position she gossiped about the people there the company drama and the company itself she even told me the rude things she would say to a customer if they asked a "stupid" question i would have been extremely happy if my waxer would have good customer service skills but unfortunately not and i will never come back to this company (and i gave this place several chances to redeem itself after lisa and laura left) pleaseeee take heed if you are considering coming here there are much much much better places in scottsdale that will treat you better than this place now i will definitely be following lisa to her own shop now
0,i went in for a follow up brow wax; 1st one wshar was ok no big complaints no rave reviews my 2nd encounter wshar was a brow clean-up & then i got talked into a facial bad moveshar was pretty condescending & didn't particularly provide a relaxing atmosphere but the worst was my facial was interrupted by the front desk girl shar excused herself came back a few minutes later (very apologetically) telling me all the supplies were in the room we were in she gathered a few things continued to apologize & assured me she'd be right back  ten mins later the front desk girl came in to offer me water & apologize for shar's absence; she also assured me shar would be back within two minutes fifteen minutes after that with no sign of shar returning i gathered my things & left  i was clear that i would not be paying for a facial that was not complete & the front desk girl was apologetic & polite she also offered me a free facial the next time i came in i politely informed her that i would never be coming back bottom line go elsewhere
0,brow lady nicky has gone to the az state board many times for lashes and waxing brows without a license this is not how the original owner (jennifer) would have wanted it this place should be shut down
0,was very curious about eyelash extensions so i purchased a groupon for a "flirt set" at the brow lady the shop is small and it looks like they do a range of services like nails and waxing as well i agree with shar b about the front desk staff i wasn't greeted in a friendly manner upon entering either just hustled into the back roomfirst of all i really wish their website gave some details and information on the do's and dont's of having these lashes if you've never gotten them before if you live in a humid climate (or plan on traveling to a humid climate) or do anything like swimming or hot yoga then skip them here i was lying on the table telling my eyelash lady that i was about to leave for a trip to southeast asia (i was hoping to do the eyelashes and forgo packing makeup) and she tells me "well i'll be surprised if they last a week" huh so i said "what do i do if i go swimming" and she says "dry them immediately with a hairdryer" of note there are no electrical outlets in the remote jungle of laos and no i wasn't  planning on bringing a hairdryer as she was applying i was already feeling cheated in paying for this once i heard they wouldn't last but then she commented that she finished in record time30 min i thought ok how long does it normally take their brochure and website says 1 12 hrs so now i was feeling cheated again like i didn't get the full treatment because i came in with a groupon well she was right about them falling off as i sweated my way through yoga and then enjoyed swimming etc on my trip they became scarce i eventually had to pull the remaining few off which wasn't fun they might be worth it for a really important occasion like your wedding or something but don't plan on them lasting through your honeymoon
0,me start off by saying i've been here once before for eyebrows and they didn't turn out so well i ended up with scabs on both my eyebrows for two weeks (not too pretty) now let me start my review on my nails they made it a bit difficult for me to make an appointment but since i was leaving town they could squeeze me in i got there was seated pretty quickly and then chose my color i decided to go with gels i've done them before so i knew the process fairly well there was absolutely no room in their "nail salon" section i didn't feel as if my girl did my nails well what-so-ever i feel bad to name her because in all honestly she was extremely sweet just had no idea how to do proper gels or a standard pedicure my gels were soft and had indents in them gels are supposed to be hard so that kind of thing doesn't happen now my pedicure it was awful she didn't know how to do an even coat i do not understand i do a much better job so i called the manager nikki i believe was her name all she did was make excuses for the girl saying oh maybe it was bad lighting or a bad curing machine for the gels seriously i would never go back there to see any nail tech they offered to do my nails again but honestly it was so uncomfortable in there and everyone had to keep moving around each other save your money and find an actual nail salon where they have some massage chairs and space
0,this moment i am very frustrated with this business i booked a gel manicure and a pedicure appointment for today at 4:30 pm when i showed up on time for my appointment the two girls at the front let me know that they were "just about to email me" because they were running behind i get it this is the nature of the service industry i completely understand if a business gets busy and begins to fall behind however i am sure that they realized at some point (at minimum half an hour or so) before my appointment that they were running behind to reach out to me at the exact time of my appointment is pretty rude since by that time customers (like me) are generally already at the business's location ready for their appointment i was also frustrated because the receptionist also said that she was just about to "email me" this made no sense to me as they already had my cell phone number which is a much more reliable way to contact someone (especially when you're calling them at the exact time of their appointment when they are usually parking or walking in; not checking email) i was extra disappointed because i was doing my nails for my anniversary and had a hair appointment and spray tan scheduled right after (meaning no flexibility in the schedule) the girls were very sweet and apologetic but the lack of professionalism around simply picking up the phone and calling me as soon as they realized that they were falling behind is pretty inexcusable
0,reading some recent reviews i feel like it is important for me to let everyone know about ashley i saw her name mentioned at least once and yes she's awful beware of this supposed licensed nail technician i felt bad at first for her but don't pay for shitty service
0,after being a client for years i stopped going to the brow lady over a year ago they stopped using quality products and my lashes were falling out  the worst part was they did nothing to try and keep my business i guess they don't care about loyal customers :(
0,this place on groupon my call was answered immediately by the receptionist who was friendly and scheduled an appointment for the next morning-a  saturday  i had a full set of eyelashes put on by valencia they looked very nice-she finished the whole set in about 30 minutes previously i've had full sets take 15+ hours here's the problem: that night my eyes were red and irritated the next morning (sunday) i woke up with my eyes very swollen red and irritated i called "the brow lady" and left a message-no response within 2days on tuesday with my eyes still red and swollen i went there around 1pm-the salon was closed with a sign that said they would be back at 4pm i called and left another message saying that i'd had a bad reaction to the lashes and needed them removed no response- to this day-3 weeks later bad customer service :(
0,all the bad reviews i read i desperately needed a manicure and decided to come here big mistakethe guy that was doing my nails clearly had no idea what he was doing i had just had a manicure the week before so i really didn't have a lot of cleaning up to do the guy went cuticle crazy kept pushing them as hard as he could it seemed then he clipped off part of my nail bed that didn't need to be it absolutely killed and started bleeding profusely to stop the blood he put that blue liquid on it and then proceeded to rub as hard as he could with a paper towel causing the cut to bleed even more it didn't stop bleeding for the rest of the appointment causing my manicure to have some blood mixed in with the nail color on the ring finger nailthen the next day i was washing dishing and the nail polish came off on 2 of my fingers i had a gel manicure it's supposed to last two weeks it didn't even last a daynever again do yourself a favor and do not visit this place spend your money somewhere that is worth it
0,note to the owner:your employee the scrawny balding man should be fired he was yelling at me and saying extremely rude things instead of fixing the nails to make the customer happy i've never been treated this way by any company that i've ever done business with i urge you to take a few moments to read about what happened from the customer's point of view as i'm sure that you may hear about it but from a different light that is favorable to the scrawny balding manmy review: they shouldn't even get one star the scrawny man with the receding hair that works there is the ultimate cause of this poor reviewsit back and enjoy this storythis was my very first time at this place and i was actually excited because the interior was pretty nicei went in to touch up my gel polish and get a pedicure i get french on both and i've gotten it done enough times to know that the white part should not have bubbles or craters in it so i kindly asked him to fix the white part before we put it under the uv light again so he did and we put it under the light when i took them outthere they werecraters bubbles missing white parts streaks(how do you post pics on here) i swear it looked like i did it myself he said it's supposed to look like thatinstead of fixing them he yelled at mei meanhe yelled at me worse than my own father ever has he was so rude and the things he said to me were jaw dropping i honestly was in shock and could not believe my ears now i know that people say that there are two sides to every story but i promise you that i wasn't happy with the white part and asked him to fix it and he flipped out and started taking it off as a customeri've never ever been talked to oh i'm sorry yelled at like that in my entire life i told him "i've never been treated this way in my life you're being very rude to a first time customer" he said "ive never had a customer tell me how to do my job"i said i'm just asking you to fix the white look can't you see the dots does this honestly look okay to you" then he started to file it all offfi was like "what are you doing just fix the white" he said "no i'm gonna take it off and you can just leave"i said "what no i came here to get my nails done and i just don't want the french white part to have bubbles or dots on it"he yelled "i've been doing this 20 years how old are you (i don't know what my age has to do with it but i suppose he was trying to say that he's been doing this longer than i've been living" (for the record i'm 28 and not an immature teenager bashing this place) anyway so the yelling at me continued and at this point i begin to yell back because i was not going to take the verbal abuse or mistreatment any longer i've never experienced such an episodehe had the uv thing on my lap i tried to hand it to him and i said please get this off of me and he slid his seat away and was telling me to drop it so it can break seriously drop itthen i said "i want to talk to the owner of this place you are so rude and should not be treating customers this way"he yelled at the top of his lungs like he wanted to hit me"no you are not going to talk to the owner you deal with me i'm the boss now" i was like what in the world is your problem i just wanted you to fix the white part of my nailsthen he said "pay for the pedicure and get out of here and we will be happy if you never come back" (can you believe this guy)i don't know how this next part even happened (and this literally just happened) but he said he was going to call the cops i was like good please do or better yet i will so the cops came (yes seriously)i told them and showed them my hands of how poor of a job he did and the way he treated me the cops obviously can't do anything about this situation so it was dumb even having them come the guy didn't even have anything to say but "she is trying to tell me how to do my job" it's like whatever happened to trying to get the nails like the customer likes them especially a new customeranyway so i paid them for the pedicure and left with the nails you're about to seei do not recommend this place at all not even if they offer a free manicure and pedicure they do a sloppy jobthey are purely mean and rude to their customersthe guy seriously yelled at me for at least 10 minutes maybe more i have never been so disrespected in my lifei was literally crying because of this man if you were there your ears would have perked up and you would have been so shocked to hear the things he was saying and the way he was saying themi don't think i'm even painting the picture of how evil he is as best as i could i wish i could recall all of the insanely rude things that he lashed out at me withoh and they don't take credit cards by the waythey have a lovely atm machine for your convenience (please take note of my sarcasm)
0,just found out that the scrawny balding little man is the owner wow i remember asking him why they didn't take credit cards and he said it was because the owner didn't want to since it costs more what a cowardi told my friend about my experience and she also had a horrifying experience there with the work they did and their customer service i hope they go out of business for mistreating customers how do they still have customersby the way when i got home and took a closer look at my pedicurei realized that it looked like a 5 year old did that colors outside the lines
0,i could leave 0 stars i would i went in for a simple polish change and had the worst experience i've ever had at a salon a kid could have painted my nails better such a waste of money i would never come back to this sad excuse for a nail salon
0,was so hopeful especially since it's in the same parking lot as tjmaxx  i need a salon that i can come to regularlyi came in for a pedicure and once she couldn't talk me into more than the basic one i got the least amount of attention especially when it came to scrubbing my calluses since i wasn't buying another $10 worth if callus remover she didn't scrub for more than literally 7 seconds per foot i was wearing a long skirt that she actually let dangle in the water won't be back ;(
0,one of the worst nail salons i have ever been to first off i explained to my nail girl (forgot to get her name) twice what i wanted because she did not bring back the correct colors so she clearly did not understand i got the response "i know" in an extremely rude tone so i thought maybe she would get the other colors later nope she started to paint all my nails the wrong color so i stopped her and explained again she did not apologize or anything the entire time she was doing my nails she spoke to her co workers all of whom were walking around the salon with no shoes on unprofessional secondly the customer service over all was horrible no one was friendly at all lastly my nails look horrible there is nail polish all over my cuticles and sides of nails the polish is uneven and the design even after showing her three times was still done wrong not sure how to attach a photo over wise i would i will never go back here even with the great coupons i have if i could give this place zero stars i would
0,doesn't even deserve one star  the whole time they asked if i wanted this and that extra  i did give in and got $33 pedicure which includes callus remover  i got home and my feet look exactly the same  they also charged $3 for shiny buff which looks like crapppppppp  oh and at the end my bill being $83 they tell me they need cash or check or i can use their atm for $1 charge  after a little while she then decides it is ok to use my card  i am so disappointed with this place especially taking my mom here for mother's day  the one lady also had nerve to say that i should pay and i am rich  wow  thankfully i am employed and am able to pay but cant imagine if i couldn't  anyway  please please don't waste your time nor money here  they can care less what your nails look like
0,is the worst place to come for a fill and gel polish went there today and my nail polish is already pealing
0,go to this salon  they not only did a terrible job but they were rude and charged a lot for the service they provided  the place looked ok when you first walk in but once you sit in the chair you notice their trays are dirty and they don't use clean sterile tools  the male tech that did my pedicure didn't speak english didn't clean out the nail bed to prepare it to be painted and painted the nails getting the polish on the skin  this place was a waste of time and money  i'm very surprised the health department didn't shut them down yet
0,know better than to not read reviews before i go into a business however i came here out of convenience when the normal salon i go to was closed my pedicure was mediocre at best  she was not meticulous in getting polish on the entire nail she also did not clean up the skin where she had gotten polish on it close to the nail i will definitely not be back it's a nice facility with clean equipment but the professionalism is not there for me
0,sad to say i have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1  i had been a faithful customer of katie's for years at least 3 or 4  she told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel  i was heartbroken  but she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so i figured i would continue to go there  next appt i needed i called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because katie isn't doing nails anymore right  i was then told that katie is still doing nails but she was full that day  very hurtful  i always tipped her very well and was always willing to work with her schedule  but needless to say i don't go there anymore haven't been there since i ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere
0,am a longtime customer of this spa but after it turned over to new management i have to say i will never be back  i got a gel mani that lasted less than 2 weeks  before they used to last 3 weeks or longer  what a waste of money i have to say i miss the old staff but fortunately found them at another salon
0,sh*t i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life i've been here quite a few times but today's visit has convinced me never to come back okay so i walk in  there are about 5 women getting pedicures and none getting manicures of course i want a full set the employees were kind of slow on getting me a nail techand oh my gosh i have the worst luck because my nail tech was a horror so let me explainokay so first impression when he sits down in front of me: this guy looks like he has the flu he was sweating and his eyes were drooping and he looked like he was about to vomit every other second but if he wasn't sick i have no idea what the hell he was doing in the back of the shop as he applied the acrylics on my nails he was shaking frantically and kept violently tapping my fingers everytime i moved them i kept patient and calm until his palm started sweating i wasn't okay with his body fluids all up in my fingernails so i asked "are you okay" and he didn't respond awkwardso after a while he asked me where i lived and i said "scottsdale" and he says "i thought you would have said south phoenix like with the crips and bloods" then chuckled listen i am not one to start confrontation by any means so i forced myself to stay calm until he was finished my nails i paid him the $35 and left he looked rather angry that i did not leave him a tipi do not recommend this nail salon i am very disappointed in the way the staff has treated me today and i think that i will travel to tempe to have a decent nail experience
0,have gone to this club in the past and have enjoyed the experience   i recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience   i saw a dancer that caught my eye i offered her a drink and a dance after her canoodling me  i gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  danceafter some pleasant conversation over the drink( i treated her to)  the dance began   after four minutes the song was over and i reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip when she explained i actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs  by my count it was one dance apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well   i thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35 this  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil she called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate   i politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did   after wards i made a quick exit   there was no mistaken that i was being blatantly scammed here  i was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer and was not drunk in the least   unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance i would  steer clear from this establishment   a night i was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation  it appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons  but  they sure as hell scammed me  on principle i'll avoid this place  and i'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well the are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to youyou've  been warned jay
0,and last to this club very pricypoor service and no contact dance  other clubs in charlotte are better  very disappointed 
0,and girl friend went here lack if girls  no ladies rest room pricy dances  i am not recommending this shit to any one
0,strip club i've ever been to do not even think you could use coupons or think the manager will honor anything received a complementary free pass and was denied by the manager even though there was no restrictions worst service ever
0,place is a craphole my friends and i have gone for a 2 am breakfast a couple of times (i know that seems weird but it's cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast) and the people working there are absolute dicks the girl at the front door acts like she's the hottest thing since sliced bread the girls that walk around are bit*hes unless you're throwing wads of money out i jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad he said she danced and he handed her $30 and she said "no it's $60"  that's crazy considering the girls don't even look very good maybe i'm biased because i'm not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good night
0,very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff
0,it if you will  little old me drinking at the bikini lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends  drinking drinking drinking  so after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club  rightso we pack up and head on over  a high cover (sorry for the life of me i don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which i do realize is standard) later we're immersed in black light  as my eyes adjust i start to see that this is really not the crowd i expected to see in a strip club  there is zero energy  no talking  no laughing  nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancerswe found some empty chairs in the back and settled in there and i was able to turn my attention to the girls  ok look:  i know they can't all be elizabeth berkley (may the lord keep her feisty nomi malone safe and warm forever)  but i didn't expect this apathy  bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain  the thing about stripping is this:  i thought the point was that you could make a lot of money  but we were there at midnight on a saturday night and these girls were getting nothing  in the hour we were there i saw one man put money in a girl's pants on stage and i watched and it was a one dollar bill  seriouslyi sat there with my 3 friends (2 men one other woman) all of us in a row all of us suddenly sober staring with our eyes and mouths wide open  i could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha  don't be dirty) as my girl friend and i felt like gender traitors just by being therei thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun  was i expecting too much  it was the most depressing experience   i sort of feel bad even writing this because nobody involved with that joint can be happy i'm sure  but i figured i owe it to all you yelp gentleman (and the ladies toowho am i to presume) to steer you away from this one
0,think max eric & jason summed this place up pretty well i dont think i'd ever get a dance here it was friday about 10pm-ish we were there about an hour i did not see one attractive girl come out in fact this was the worst line up i have ever seenevar i wont nit pick about the girls i saw but i will not be returning either ladies if your feeling down about a little weight gain go herehell who am i kidding even i it's a lot of weight gain do your self esteem a favor and start your night here
0,is the worst strip club i have ever been to i have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well i've been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can't even dance clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners nothing and i mean nothing is as bad as this club the new york city bouncer out front was a nice guy and thats where it stopped the girls here are downright disgusting these girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at mvd the place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke there were no girls dancing when we were there the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when i said no then rolled their eyes and walked away well maybe these girls could dance on stage and then ask for a private dance i want to see what you're made of firstthe dress code out front the disgusting women the attitude from bartenders and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star it would be negative one if it were an option hi liter bombshells and even cheetah's are a ton better than this place they are cheaper have better talent and are very friendly places even the overpriced bourbon street would be a better bet than this
0,name alone we had to check this place out just for kicksouchbandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way and you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measurei've got no qualms with talent don't get me wrong; the female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form a woman is a woman is a beautiful woman and i'm a sucker by default naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enterthe squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under a tacky illuminated "bandaids show lounge" sign the surrounding parking lot emanating with "damn i'mma get mugged out here" uncertainty and darknessonce inside (yes you go in through a sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door) you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar while another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat down - *sub-standard: the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (ca law) went unnoticed  a printed "no sideways caps no baggysaggy jeans no long tees" dress code posted by the door should have been a red flag classyafter getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really really good-looking - hottest girl on staff setting false precedent for what the stage talent would look like) we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge finding a couple of tables near but not next to the center stagemost of us sat talking and laughing with each other occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place mostly empty on a friday night the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner getting dances from any girl that would come his way the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the er more amply-bossomed strippers the table of youngins dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibitedgirl after girl (a couple of "a'ight" girls most "everyday" girls and at least one "is that a girl" girls) came to the stage gyrated to cliche strip club music - some exhibiting-gymnast calibre pole skills and limberness - then cruised the showroom floor peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection "would you like a dance  would you like a dance" propositioning sales basics 101: always be closing rightnone of us partook in the festivities but two friends in an adjoining party did  one quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it  the other a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist afghanistan got one of the [few] barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs and about $100after a quick 30 minutes we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of "meh" talent and skeevy behavior  and that's when we saw itthe epitome of tacky divey strip club attirethe summation of the bandaids experiencethat's when we saw it the hood-kini*it was time to leave quickly as we braved the parking lot  it was joke after firstaid-alluding and infectious-disease related joke automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip"band-aids" because correlating "possibility of infection" and adult entertainment is savvy business sense____________________yes yes  a hooded bikiniin black and neon a hood to obscure her face while thin straps and patches of material covered her naughty bits  a hooded  bikini  if she were gonna take your money she might as well look the part
0,place sucks worst place in town
0,looking talent and really good food specials will always bring the customers into this place i will not return to this establishment again when in the area for businessthe cocktailfood service was the worst service in all of phoenix if management knew how much money that was not spent because of this lousy service heads would most definitely roll
0,must of went on a bad day (sunday around 4) everyone was very disrespectful would not acknowledge me at the bar she was too busy chatting with the strippers one stripper gave my friend a dance without even asking she was definitely on something i could keep going not worth coming back the attitudes here in general ruined our night
0,this place was the best club around  now it's the worst i mean sure there are a few boobies to look at but that's about it  the girls don't talk to anyone and ask if you want a table dance  i checked around the room a few times and other than the three dancers on the three stages there were no other girls to be seen in the place (well other than the ones in our party but they weren't dancing)we tried asking the servers to bring us some dancers and nothing  we tried to make it rain money on the dancers and told them to come back and nothing  this was a "busy" saturday night so you would think the dancers would on their a game but nothing if i'm gonna go to a titty bar i at least want that stripper perfume sent on me next time  i going to check out band-aids next time
0,didn't spend quite enough time in here to give this a totally legit review but when me and my friend walked in it was darker than most clubs inside the place was very small and very packed with creepers and the girls didn't take their tops off they just wore what looked like bikinis i just think if you go to a strip club they should show you their boobs maybe they do and we just didn't stay long enough to see it but until i see different this place gets a 1
0,a veteran of the strip club scene and former dancer at heartbreakers now bombshells i'm sending out a big "shame on you" to the management at bombshells we rented a party bus for my best friends bachelor party and were told bombshells was one of the clubs on the vip list i called the club to alert of our arrival time to make sure we could get in the person i spoke to was quite rude over the phone but said they make decisions regarding admittance on a case by case basis i told him we were a large group would buy drinks and as a former dancer all my friends are schooled to pay the dancers well when we got there we were met at the door and told we would have to pay full cover and that they wouldn't do anything special for our bachelor lucky for us our driver got a tip to go the the hi-liter which turned out the be the best ever so again shame on you bombshells and to the girls who missed out on lots of money that night go work at a real club peace
0,a joke this is a strip club it's close to the worst strip club i've ever been to i'm pretty sure i would have had a better time thrown money at hookers for nothing on van buern and driving off and watching them fight over the money the great alaskan bush company is the only place i'll try or go to next time i'm in the phx area this place is way over crowded and i have no idea why
0,went to a strip club in mexico once and had a memorable experience one that i've tried to replicate for many years afterthe stripper who was very cute and also very proud of her lactating skills would for all of a buck hastily whip out one of her tits on demand squeeze it and shoot a stream of milk at you she reminded me of drunk me peeing in a parking lot someplacewaving my stream around until i've spelled out my name  peoplenow that's entertainmentas compared with the candy store where some dumb-as-a-bag-of-hammers stripper who's all too willing to spend a few thousand bucks on breast implants while badly in need of dental implants snubs you because the black-light illumination is prominently displaying  the pee stain on your cargo shorts the candy storenice boobsbad grillesand girls with no fundamental lactating  squirting abilities which they should possess since most are single moms a disappointment on every level
0,this club while on a trip to az for a niners game; from la not a very diverse or diversity friendly club my boyfriend and i and another couple (who all happen to be african american) we followed around by the security and the $100 bill we paid for drinks and tips with was passed around several times to validate it's validity a few dancers did an excellent job with pole dancing and tricks but the music wasn't really good (not that we needed to hear rap or hip hop) mostly old rock music and no name house music i would not recommend
0,on a friday evening wwaited 30 minutes before a dancer offered a dance alll the dancers are old and 30+ with hard bodies and wrinlked faces their mouths stink and one female with a blue dress was so dirty u cud see the hair in her assyuckand this female did not return the change took 20 dollars for a 10 dollar lousy lapdance only one attractive young female and she was all th etime with one guy and after that guy left she also leftridiculousshit place ugly womenold bodiesstinky mouths dirty asses and very racist avoid
0,seriously this place is definitely one of the worst strip clubs that i have ever been i usually don't write a bad review and if there is something wrong i prefer to tell it to the owner but this place was so bad that i feel like whoever is in charge of this place is just disrespectfulit was a saturday night we got there at 11:00 pm there were maybe 15 people in the clubwhich looked weird to me because the club is very impressive it took more than 30 min for the waiters to come to our table no girls came to out table for the whole time that we've been there beside to the fact that there were no more than 5 dancerswe left after about 45 min that club without even finish our drinks and went to another club i will never go there again simply a waste of time and money
0,place is a dump the girls are long past their prime and some never has a prime i mean you actually want to give some of the girls  $$ to keep their tops onso when you drive by and see the sign at the corner of spring mountain and wynn keep driving- do not stop unless you really really want to waste your time and money
0,left sams i am a local who comes here occasionallypaid $20 for what turned out to be a 10 second dance it was a complete ripoff do not go here
0,hearing the yelp reviews the wife and i thought we would check it out $5 for both of us for couples night (monday) sure enough that's how much we paid to get in it was very busy we had to wait a little for seats after we got settled we enjoyed the girls on stage for a while but we were there for almost two hours and not one girl approached us for a dance we finally got the attention of one who took us to the booths in the back $40 for a "couples" dance one song and i got pretty much completely left out of it (so much for couples part) she didn't even try very hard eitherwe immediately left and went to sapphire and had the time of our lives you pay a-little more but you get 5 star treatment
0,darlings  failheard this place could be a great fun spot for couples & has vip booths with hookah's but i guess i'll never really know- called & spoke to hostess to set up a vip booth package which includes limo pick up- limo driver called to confirm pick up time (12am)- limo driver called 45 min late & apologized he is running behind but he is on his way- hour 12 later limo driver yet again apologizes and offer's discount on package- 2 hours later almost 2am limo driver never shows up and doesn't pick up phone or return callswhat pissed me off the most is this was all for my fiance's surprise 30th birthday luckily the top club of vegas "spearmint rhino" came through and their limo picked us up in 5 minutesif you want to take your chances and risk getting stood up then by all means go to little darlings but if you want a+ customer service in a flash go with spearmint rhino instead your loss little darlings was going to spoil my love rotten that night at your club :op
0,is an overdue review for one of the worst experiences ever in vegasso a pack of us are in sin city for "frozen fury" to watch the kings play colorado  emotions were riding high since the kings won and was going to be my buddy's first time at a strip clubwe stroll in grab seats and enjoy the festivities  hot chicks everywhere so i slowly drift off into candylandahhhhhh  little did i know that the wolves were slowly working on one young pup  a dancer came over and whispered into the "pup" ears and off he went to the vip room3-6-8 songs lateri ask"where's puperoni"  of course the others in the pack ignored me   songs continuechi chis are bouncing" hey cwhere is your boy"  c gets up and heads to the vip room  bouncer stops him from entering and tells him he cant go in  by then our group heads to see what's upat some point the dancer was able to get the "pup's" credit card and racked up a bill for $990 and took him for $170 in cash  wtf  okay now maybe it was at least 10 songs with full nudity but how do rack up $1000 for lap dances  bullsh*tmy buddy's pup signed the credit card receipt so there was nothing to contest except that our young apprentice got taken  little "sparky" has a crappy job making $9 an hour so this $1000+ lesson should be around for quite a while  i had a great time venue was cool but do the "little darlings" at little darlings have to feed on the young  i was also taught that "you get more bees with honey"  i guess not  not sure if i would ever go back  if you provide a wild and exciting time the boys will come however this was all shady  definitely rubbed me the wrong way  you only get one star cause i can't give you lessbut then again you already took what you couldadvice watch your young or leave the pups at home  there are tons of other places to go in vegas  next time i will recommend to stay in ca and call up the girls from ashley entertainment
0,finding out that most strip clubs in vegas were 21+ (yes in cali almost all strip clubs are 18+ due to alcohol laws) my gf and i had no choice but to come to this lovely hole in the wall 30 dollars cover charge not bad for vegas you know so i keep an open mind and take a step in  the real problem for me was that  there wasn't really any "stripping" per say the strippers would come out in their bathing suits then go to the back take it off then come out completely naked wtf isn't stripping supposed to be sexy stripping done right is an art but all these girls would do was come out naked and do the same moves they would shake their asses around repeatedly and of course all the horn dogs would drool and think its the best thing on earth yawnthere were also questionable role playing and dancingthere was an act of grim reaper yes she came out in a grim reaper outfit (with the blade and all) i was confused and started laughing there's nothing sexy about a grim reaper why not have a dominatrix or something that's more appealing there was also a strange part where they layed a blanket out and poured candle wax on their bodies kinky nope for some reason it was just gross they were so unattractive physically and personality wise there were also 3 strippers that made a huge fuss on stage they were wildly waving their arms around at each other because nobody tipped them while they were on their poles they were all mad and they even went up to a guy and started yelling when he gave them two dollars then she proceeded to flip him off errr people pay you to strip not to be a bitch if you would just do your job and do it well people would freaking tip you period overall the girls were all around 6's they were out of shape (stretch marks pooches and tatts everywhere) unenthusiastic and looked miserable i swear some of them looked like they would rather go to jury duty then to be dancing at that club i don't know where this establishment got these "dancers" but for vegas i was thoroughly disappointed when i come back again in a few weeks (when i turn 21) hopefully i'll visit a real vegas strip club such as spearmint rhino or treasuressave your money for quality guys
0,went for a bachelor party for a friend extremely sketchy but it was super cheap  some of the dancers threatened to throw us out because my friend didn't give them $40 for a dance when we saw him hand them two $20s  also when we were just sitting and smoking hookah and having a good time girls would come over and get angry at us for not getting a dance it was awkward and sketchy and ridiculous  never again
0,my drunken conquest to visit my very first all nude strip club our cab driver suggested this place we pulled into the parking lot saddled up with our driver and at 5:45am we were told the place was closing at 6am and that they were not allowing any more clients for the evening boo
0,will never go to this place again and i recommend the many otherclubs for anyone looking for a good time while in vegas i was charged double the posted rate for a dance by a dancer namedcya when i brought the overcharging to a managers attentioninstead of refunding my money they gave me entry passes to the club  ihope cya gets fired for being fraudulent and lying to management about what shecharges customers  dances are $20 per song i was charged $40 per song for topless onlyagain i will not be returning to this club as longas cya is employed there and i suggest everyone do the same  saveyour money and go to a better club
0,my just turned 18 year old cousin to here while we were in town we did this package that included vip seating unlimited hookah a picture for the celebrant and admission for 10 people for $250i had already spoken with someone over the phone and they said it would be ok for us to get the package and when we got there they acted like "what package" we ended up talking to the manager and when we showed the money they remembered that they did have this package we walked thru the metal detectors and were seated on three couches up front near the stage it was almost 1am and there were a handful of people i guess it was couples night and there were a handful of couples tryna get they're "freak on" i guess when they came to ask what flavor hookah we wanted they said they only had two flavors left so we got those two flavors mint & fruit punch and when picture time came the stupid waitress didn't even know how to work the camera and all they did was print the picture and  tape it to a cardso to the good part there was no good part little darlings is fully nude but the bodies are bangin' small boobies some cute girls and the dancers are lazy as f%k only a couple got on the pole to do some tricks most of them were just walking around stage and rolling around on the floor it didn't take them long to take their strings of clothes off i thought dancing was supposed to be an "art form" but i guess do what you gotta do for those dollar$unless we came on a bad night or the wrong time i would never come back here again i wouldn't recommend it to anyone either
0,everywhere place smells like smoke no classjust no
0,is embarrassing to write about but it's that important for everyone to know this place is a huge scam  first you have to pay $33 cover for out of towners which is expensive since other clubs have free admission and a limo ride not to be mean but the girls are not as hot as other places which my group immediately noticed also i want to warn everyone that 2 of my friends got hustled here so be very wary of anything extra they offer  if you come avoid anything extra but the smart thing is dont come here
0,really like this place  the children shows are awesome so when i heard of the adult shows i thought it would be brilliant  i was wrongi had actually spoken to the staff prior to attending the show they told me something along the lines of it was for adults not for the easily offended but nothing xxx  i was miss informed i'm not easily offended  i am also a fan of stand up comedyi am not sure where to start  i guess they feel that since its for adults they should say s**t every other word  the first half had sketches that were decent at best some entertaining  i laughed once or twice  some of the puppeteers were really good at animating their puppets  all and all 1st half was eh 2-3 out of 5well then there was intermission and the second half began   oh boy where to begin where to begin  it was so slow and boring the tucson puppet works should really look into another hobby  the puppets were poorly made  it was just bad  i think i heard maybe one or two people laugh during the entire thing  for about 4 minutes it was just puppets having sex  it was boring  team america puppets having sex funny this well this was crap  i kept hoping it wold be over and the new sketch would start  it kept going and going i finally stole a program from the person sitting next to us  when i saw that the tucson puppet works had the entire second half of the show we stood up and walked out  children shows awesome adult slams i guess the best way to describe it would be painful extremely painful
0,to beginthis was such a waste of time my friends and i attended a friday night adult puppet show just curious to see what it would be like i am glad it was only $8 i felt like apologizing to everyone afterward  because the entire show was so disappointingthe jokes were not witty the skits were disorganized and one of them just sad no one laughed the entire time for example one of the skits was about a gay pirate what is funny about this how is this an adult theme just because he is gay it is an adult theme another skit involved a jilted cinderella-type character who was angry that her prince charming left her for a man again it's adult-themed because he's gay ok just not funny another low-point in the show was the improv skit where they asked the audience for a topic and just went with it the only word i can think of to express what happened is "cringe-worthy" so what did i expect from an adult puppet show well funny jokes that i have not heard before and weren't funny just because they're gross i expected intelligent humor maybe innuendo and some wit i don't mind cursing or sexual humor at all just wanted it to not be solame
0,the adult puppet slam:we were excited to goand we wanted this to be a riotous and fun nightbutjust not good seriously bush league a hodge-podge of barely talented people claiming artistry or humor only mildly entertaining for a few (very) brief moments  that was pretty much the consensus amongst the four of us
0,am extremely disappointed  i planned my whole sunday around this area since we wanted to see the puppet show  the twins were talking about it all morning long  we went to lunch and then the twins said " puppet" it was still a little early so we stopped by to get to sweets to take home  we got there at 1:15pm  they told us to be there by 1:30 since then is when they open the doors and it is first come first serve  there were two families before us  the place seemed a little cleaner than last time we were there  we got in and sat in the carpet (which is the closest for the kids)  the seats are now a little farther away so i had to sit also on the floor to the side by my twins  i don't like to leave them unsupervised yet (yes i am a little bit of a helicopter they are 4 after all)  the show was supposed to start at 2:00pm  the cute little brothers in front of us were asking us the time every five minutes  when it was 2 they got all excited but nothing  10 minutes went by and nothing  20 nothing i had to whip out my iphone and give it to my little girl to have her watch some netflix to keep her calm my hubby did the same with our little boy for a while we had a crowd surrounding our kids around the phones  finally at 2:30 after sitting in the hard floor for an hour they tell us they are going to start so they begin with their schtick and "rules" this started to go on and on it seems like they are frustrated comedians trying their material on this audience  after 15 minutes i had to leave because my kids could not take it any more  i cannot blame them  they were very good for one hour and 15 minutes of doing nothing but sitting on a hard floor  i am glad it was a groupon and not full price i didn't even ask for a refund because i am never ever ever coming back
0,staff is extremely rude the blonde older lady was nasty to us and our kids  we finally had to snap back when she was mean to our kids we drove 2 hrs with our family it cost us over $5000 to get in caught the last show it wasn't a puppet show just old props and singing my kids were disappointed they are under 5 and also expected a puppet show i will never recommend this place is this what pheonix has to offer horrible money grabbers don't talk to ppls kids diguisting "ever" lady or the parents  save your money ppl and catch a movie
0,family of 4 (3 and 5 yr old) wanted to love this place but it was a waste of money  we want our $60 back first of all they claim to have the largest conservatory in america  yes by blueprint this may be true but when you walk in it does not look like a rainforest in anyway and you only see one or two types of butterflies  please make way to houston's butterfly conservatory (texas)  that is a real rainforest carrying all kinda of butterflies from around the world  also there was no information to be found on walls about anything you saw  they give these cards to the children to ask a volunteer for a "fun fact" and we only passed 2 volunteers there was no one available to tell you what you were looking at  no signage of explanations of any sort  how is this educational please please do not waste your money  you are better off watching youtube videos or going to the library for information also they had ants and bees  same thing no descriptions  we walk into this tiny aquarium with maybe 3 fish tanks with 2 fish in them  we saw one lady who asked if we were going to do some petting um ok and proceeds to give us hand sanitizer first of all what are we petting we put our hands in the water to pet what looks like a stingray no signage no one is there to tell us anything so disappointing again why is this educational the fish in the tank has a white piece of paper on the wall that looked like they had just printed it earlier that morning with the name of the fish  that's it no other information about where the fish is from nothing  my husband made a comment hey we eat that fish  you can get that at the asian market lol oh and when we waited to see the movie a man came in and had to read off a piece of paper his welcome message which had nothing to do with the movie  just about where the exits were  lol nothing to see here  the only cool thing my kids got was a butterfly and caterpillar balloon that was not made by them (willie's creations) because it was the grand opening weekend  also the 3d flight of the butterflies movie was great for the kids but not worth $60 i don't think so  save your money and go to desert botanical  at least there are people who can give you information oh and need to add it took us 35 min (not including movie) to see everything  we had planned for this to be at least a 2 hr adventure for the price we were paying
0,experience ever it's super expensive and the staff is not friendly $60 for 1 adult and 2 children's for 30 min and that's include 10 min for a movie again worst experience ever so disappointed  i don't recommend it whatsoever 
0,went on september 1st and i have to say i was miserable  it was over 6500 for two adults and a 5yr and 8yr old  we waited in a long line front from the begining and then went to see a movie  the movie was good and we did like that but everything else was poor  this place is beautiful on the outside but a poor set up on the inside  hot and humid and the butterfly exhibit though beautiful had dead ends in each section it would of been more functional to keep it going with the walk way so it was not so congested also the ant exhibit was horrible and the fish tanks were really no big deal  we live in arizona so we know what scorpions are  just think the fee to get in was way to much for what you were given  the cafeteria cost 1300 for two bags of candy and two juice boxes and then you leave thru the gift store which every kid was complaining as they wanted a toy or somthing  clever on the store part but not fair to the parents  we bought a plastic butterfly ring and with tax as 491 for a 10 cent ring i will never go back and i bet this will be closed down before to long   sorry but have to be honest
0,not go with young kids  expensive bad food small rooms poor customer service and not stroller friendly  they make you sit thru a 15 minute movie which was miserable with my little ones  the food was terrible and overpriced  people were literally returning rotten fruit in front of me and the cashier would l t take anything off the shelves  the staff were rude - we got yelled at in the atrium because my toddler had a butterfly land on her and she went nuts i'm talking screaming ballistic  we could t find a staff to help us so we took the butterfly off of her to get her to stop yelling and immediately a staff appears out of nowhere and is yelling at us for touching it  i was not impressed with the customer service and was told we couldn't skip the movie even with 3 toddlers who just would not sit still and bothered the people around us
0,consumers specifically this poor review belongs to the mirror maze part of butterfly wonderland as annual members of butterfly wonderland they sent both me and my girlfriend an email that says this"as a member of butterfly wonderland we are extending a sneak peak at the newest must see in scottsdale just print out this email and you will receive one complimentary walk-through pass"  seems simple enough but it was at best a bait and switch and more accurately an outright lie  adding to the nastiness was a  discourteous staff that found pleasure in being very abrupt about telling us the offer was a mistake which they had no intention of honoring and was good only for a quick single walk through of only their laser area of the venue  we had two choices  pay $995 plus tax  per person for each of us and our two children (6 and 4 years old) or we were free to leave i paid the $43 bucks and we walked through the mirror maze this mirror maze part is not worth the extra fee my advice is to wait for the carnival to come to town  the mirror maze you'll find in a carnival funhouse will be more entertaining and the carnie staff likely more courteous
0,i wish i knew this was on yelp i would save the time and moneyi am a hardcore jfk fan my license plate is jfk and boy was i disappointedeverything is a replica items are scattered in a huge meeting event room it looks so amateurish i felt like it was disrespectful to the 35th president even if it was free admission i'd still be disappointed and upset i could have done a better job doing it in my living room shame on you tropicana
0,i checked yelp for this immediately after walking in biggest joke by far i wanted to take pictures to show how absurd the display and over all appearance of this place was but didn't want to spend any extra time in there trying to get a refund it was sparse everything was a duplicated version apparently chairs from other presidents and other first ladies dresses were in there nothing what i thought it would be i would give a higher review for the supervisor that refunded me the 3 tickets i bought for locals totaling $71 i would have been disappointed even if it was free oh well dallas here i come for the real deal
0,a person (plus a $4) fee on top of each ticket when we got to the ticket "booth" (it was actually a dining table with a table cloth draped over it) the ticket machine wouldn't work two people were ahead of us and we still were waiting 20 minutes to buy tickets finally (a plus here) a nice couple gave us their extra tickets for free: thank-you (and boy am i glad i didn't have to pay)other than the cars and about 5 wee things nothing is either real or even related to jfk it was set up like a primary school science project in a giant vacant room the posters with "facts" were full of misspellings and even had some questionable accuracyi spent time in there hoping that i'd stumble upon some gem but alas it was awfulthe icing on the cake was when i fellow decided to cross the rope line to sit at one of jfk cars he should not have done this and i do not  condone it however the man working at the "gift area" who i assume is also the curator and security guard began yelling an screaming at this person he then continued on to call the man "stupid" and uttered swear words to himself then he did nothing he allowed this "offender" to continue on looking unsupervised then i witnessed him talking to another female that appeared to be working the exhibit as well he spoke loudly using the f-word so that everybody at the exhibit could hear finally he expressed that he was less concerned about the car and more about getting the picture back from the "offender" what the helli left shortly after that i feel like the tropicana did not do their research on this particular exhibit i feel that the whole thing was purely for profit and that no legitimate interest or research on jfk was presentedvery dissapointed glad i didn't pay to the couple that handed us the free tickets thank-you in more ways than one
0,heart is broken  the derby machine has been removed for repairs  they didn't say when it would be back and i have a hunch it is gone for good the last vestige of the las vegas that i love is gone :'(  bobby d was right at the end of casino "corporations ruined it  the good ' ol days  today it's all gone"  the slot person said it was removed for repairs but i know it was moved because of dollars per square foot or the percentage of the take or the profits per hour or whatever these people use to gouge every last penny of profits  i am sure they are bringing in a digital version insteadthe last known to me derby machine has been sent to storage  this is not about the removal of a game this is about the end of an era  las vegas has officially jumped the shark  the last icon of the real las vegas is gone(as of 12-16-2012)in the event they bring this back please post
0,ballooning didn't cancel our reservation for our ride until 16 hour prior  we had no opportunity to rebook this event in a timely manner  i had purchased this as a gift for my parents who flew into town specifically for this event  they stated we can upgrade to a private flight for only $699  not accomodating at all with the situation and they should have canceled in a resonable manner as noted on their policy  policy is for us to cancel 72 hours in advance or they will charge us a fee  it should work both ways
0,know it's a long review but i think you'll enjoy it:this was a couple years ago but the issues aren't anything that would have changed so i decided to write a review anyway so other people might know what they're getting intobf at the time bought the ride for my bday he paid full price & thought it was a private ride for 2 we ended up in a tiny balloon basket with a pilot & 2 young asian girls lucky for him he loved asian girlsa lot i am not asian you can understand why this was an issue for me i did not enjoy my bf smashing against 2 hot young asian chicks in a basket for my birthday not the company's fault but would be nice if they had informed him that there would be other people on our romantic champagne ride he kept apologizing to me for this but it didn't helpto make it worse the girls kept complaining about having gotten up early & talking about how they only went on the ride bc their dad paid 12 price for the ride via groupon nothing like knowing my bf spend the equivalent of more than half his menial paycheck on a gift when the other people paid half price again i know it's not the company's fault that some people don't look at groupon but it was just another negative on our tripthe pilot wasok ex bf mentioned that i fly airplanes and from that point on the balloon pilot was very condescending toward measide from the questionable company the ride was strange as well there is no real launch site we got up at like 3:30 or 4 am on my bday drove to a location where we met the crew then rode around in a van while they tried to figure out where we would launch i don't know anything about hot air balloons but driving around for a couple hours was pretty annoying guess it's how hot air ballooning goes soexpect thatguess what you do after you wake up early and drive around with the crew and the hot asian girls for a long time you put together their hot air balloon that's rightit's a very tom sawyer kind of trick where they're like "hey you're going to actually help us built the balloon you're gonna fly in it's so fun" uhhhit's not fun it's work and the little asian girls were scottsdale snobs and refused to help sofor my bday i got to assemble a hot air balloon at the crack of dawn while one asian girl stood and watched rolling her eyes and complaining and the other slept in the van bc these 18 year old girls partied too hard the night before ughthe flight itself was fine uncomfortable for me bc of the weird situation being squished into a tiny basket with my boyfriend's asian fantasy girlsi have never been in a hot air balloon before or after this but the "landing" was pretty much a crash we hit tree tops on the way down we were told to brace for impact and the touchdown was very violent dust and rocks flying everywhere while the ground crew tried to catch the ropes and help us to stop without tipping overthe "champagne breakfast" was the crew throwing out a basket of packaged muffins on a tailgatethink otis spunkmeyer style and some sunny delight with the option of champagne to mix with the sunny d wellfor the two of us who were over 21 fantasy asian chicks were like 18 so no ghetto sunny d mimosas for them they got in the van and slept while the crew packed up the balloonsoit wasn't what he thought wasn't what i thought and we paid double the price of the other customers it kinda sucked except for the asian girlstheir daddy bought them the ride and they got to sleep a lot and get checked out by my bf the whole time so i guess it was ok for them hopefully they'll write a nicer review
0,agree with jason b the service here sucks  you have to flag down the wait staff and tell them what you need they are not helpful  the food was good when i got it  i came here with a group of 14  most of our party already had dessert while i still even hadn't gotten my salad  i was the last one sitting at the table when everyone got up still eating my food  this was not a pleasant experience  the waiter was extremely forgetful and had to be told several times that i didn't have my food  i feel that my meal should have been comped because the way things were handled i am never going back
0,in here for a late lunch as i saw this place had high recommendations  it took some time to get waited on  there was only 2 tables with people eating and another group of several persons were leaving  the staff were inconsiderate and just kept standing and talking and taking photos with these people who were on their way out  i wanted something that was not hot and spicy so i ordered the chicken sandwich  waitress asked me if i wanted mushrooms and cheese on it so i asked if the mushrooms were fresh  she said they were so i told her to put them on  one bite into the sandwich and i knew they were not fresh mushrooms bur canned i sat there for some time waiting for someone to ask me how everything was but nobody ever checked back with me  i got up and left  as i was leaving i mentioned to the gal at the counter how disappointed i was and she acted like she didn't hear me and asked me if i was walking out without paying  i told her i was not going to pay for something i could not eat and should have been told that the mushrooms were canned and not freshvery disappointing food and waste of my timethe area this place is located in is not a very good area and i would advise people to not go after dark
0,i could give this place no stars i would the staff was absolutely the rudest set of people imaginable  the server who had the sloppiness of a self dressed 3 year old there who claims to be new and doesn't know the menu also claims to be the manager go figure we sat down at 715 and walked out by 9 that's how long it took for our meal i ordered 5 pieces of byrek and the waitress brought it up on herself to only bring out 3 because she said it was too much food for the amount of people i hadummmmm okay so i said that i still wanted the original order of my 5 total and then she said they didn't have any more so basically lied to my face about it amongst the other issues that happened that evening i got my salad at the end of the meal  after i got my check by the way so i proceeded to explain that i didn't want the salad because we were already leaving and she refused to take it off of my check even though i literally received it after i got my check i figured fine i'll deal with it then she charged me for all 5 pieces of byrek when i only received 3 she solved this issue by telling me i ordered 5 so that's what she charged me for even though i only received 3 i also ordered a $9 plate and she charged me $10 for it basically she was so incompetent that she couldn't look at the menu and charge me the prices that were right there in front of her facewhen she refused to just take a second look at my check so i could show her that i clearly had gotten over charged  she handed me a business card and told me to call her another day because she was done talking to me about what the issue was luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had orderedthe whole scenario of a bosnian themed place is mediocre  it looks dirty and not well kept they had sesame street wrapping paper table cloths who the hell uses wrapping paper as a table cloth the table was dirty when we sat down mind you we were the only table they had initially there was an employee drinking beer while he was working this place was a disaster it's extremely pitiful because the food wasn't half bad but i can not tell you how horrible these employees were especially the waitress who could not even comprehend a 9 key register and spoke 25% of the english language she should seriously be in the back of the store so you wouldn't have to see that horrible wretched face of hers i'm in the same line of work and if i ever treated someone who came to my restaurant with that kind of utter disrespect i would fire myself 
0,it just me or do restaurants in montreal just like to take their sweet timearriving after 8 with a party of 12 we were told that it was a busy night but things shouldn't be much later than usual fair enoughafter our server skipped passed us many many times assuming that we were waiting for some people when we had told him we weren't waiting we put in our foodi ordered a green salad  $6 and there was nothing in it except greens that seemed like it had come from a boxed salad from costco i had asked for a large portion but he indicated that it was quite big forming  a ball too bad this ball was pretty much full of air as the greens had no extras - cucumber onion tomato just greenswhile our table was split into 2 groups of 6 the consistency of service was terrible table 1 got appies and approximately 5 minutes after table 2's main course had come out which is understandable because they must've been super hungry (probably after 9) as we were finish our appies our server said that he didn't want to rush us and asked if we would like our main courses to be put in we were so hungry - of course yes we thought he was going to bring out our main courses but no he had not even punched the order into the kitchen yet  it was probably another 40 minutes before table 1's mains came out and by then table 2 is already eating dessert we were so hungry to the point that we were not even hungry anymore when we called the waiter over he looked so nervous and had no answers for us as he hurried back into the kitchen in the hopes to get us something to eat let me say that all our food options were either raw rare or lightly seared not sure what took so longthe mains came out probably 10:30 we were not hungry anymore my salmon tartare with avocado and lemon oil was sub par it was 2 3 avocado puree and the lemon oil tasted like water although other people thought the food was good i could have really had a good meal elsewhere without the wait timenot going to write anymore there's nothing more to say the thought of thinking about this makes me sad
0,you are in the mood for rude service from a manager nonetheless then this is the place for you we had a party of 12 come here for dinner we ordered food (not that great) appetizers and plenty of drinks on their menu it clearly says that drinks with double alcohol are $8 which we thought was quite the deal so two friends of mine had two drinks with double alcohol each totalling 4 still with me good so when the bill came you'd think the two drinks per person would be $16 each no they neglect to tell you that it's $8 per alcohol shot not the entire drink so those two drinks ended up costing a hefty $32 per person when this was brought up to the waitress she brought over the manager who was a rude little french troll he was sarcastic loud and didn't know what it meant to please the customer after explaining why we were charged that much he just wouldn't listen to our explanation of how deceiving their menu is when it comes to that drink special it just didn't get into his thick skull at one point sarcastically he said "what do you want me to do call the owner at home and have him come explain this to you" fellow yelper lourdes w gave him a piece of her mind saying how rude he was being and that he had no tact he needed to address his customer's concerns in a respectful manner and appease us since we spent quite alot of money with a party of 12 this shut him up and we decided to just pay the bill and leave for sure my friend will be calling their credit card to contest the charge say what you want about america and it's customer service skills but something like this would have never happened in the states our economy may be in the gutter and our crime rate may be increasing but pleasing the customer at restaurants is something that is always honored wherever you go stay away from this dump
0,and my lady went here new year's day because there were not too many places open  we got seated right away but then waited 20 minutes until someone aknowledged us  couldn't even flag anyone down because they stuck us in the corner  this was same for 2 other couples that got seated near usfinally ordered drinks and food30 minutes later food came; it was not appealing at all and way overpriced  burger was gray all the way through and hard  salad was drenched with dressing  everyone sitting in our vacinity were aggravated and some got up and lefti asked for the bill; it took another 15 minutes to get that  then i waited for the waitress to come back to make change so that i didn't have to leave her a tiphere's a tip for anyone considering going to boccacino's don't botherif i can stop one person from eating here then this review was a success
0,the worst so-called italian food i have ever eaten
0,does yelp offer 0 stars i didn't get a chance to even see the food but based on the other reviews i am probably not missing much this is my first time in montreal i flew up for the weekend from virginia i had a 3 am flight and arrived here around noon and was extremely hungry after walking around i noticed this place and walked in my girlfriend and i walked into a busy atmosphere and a couple of guys behind us walked in as well the hostess was working on getting a table for a woman in front of us and completely took off before acknowledging we had walked in then to make room i walked closer to the hostess desk and another woman walked up and the d-bags behind me started speaking french and the woman wrote them down they didn't even tell the woman i was there first  so then she proceeds to not know how to speak english which is be of the two languages of this country while the real hostess was being useless this woman misspelled my name as she was taking my information and i told her i was here before those two guys and she said no i wasn't what a piss poor manager place and i dare the manager or owner to contact me so i can tell him how rude is staff is at the door if you are traveling avoid this place like the plague i'm sure montreal has plenty to offer and even though so d-bags have already ruined my experience here even though us americans can be rude we still know our place and don't treat tourist like sh*t
0,my fourth visit to their outside deck conveniently located in the center of the city saturday evening at 7:00pm service was non-existent  the reason was the wait staff was drinking and partying inside outside on the deck and on the sidewalk drinking beer and doing "shots" at the tables with other patrons  doing shots from table to table they were rude and loud and obviously drunk i waited for a menu waited for a long time for dinner to be served our waitress said she would check on our meal but we watched her and she never did finally it arrived standard fare nothing special but the drunken non caring wait staff was apalling
0,wish i had read the reviews first we were starving and craving italian this is not that the steak my son got was good but that was all the service was ok but the food took forever if we had been in the us i would have complained but i didn't want to be the typical ugly american i should have avoid at all costs 
0,place was unbelievable poor in regards to service i have yet to ever sit down in a busy restaurant for a lunch service read the menu choose a dish feed my 9 month daughter clean up and leave and not once have one staff member come by take our order
0,service poor quality food i ordered the trio sliders which was over cooked and tasteless
0,went in for breakfast as they were one of the few open this early on a weekend morning walking in the ambience is very nice however this is as much compliments i can give i ordered a standard breakfast (eggs toast sausages and potatoes) first off service is slow it took around 15 minutes to get my food and it was not busy this early in the morning the toast was burnt the eggs were still a bit raw the hash browns were just a pile of grease the sausages were bland all the while no one offered a refill of my coffee lastly the price i paid for this is absolutely overpriced honestly i would much prefer going to ikea spending a dollar for breakfast and expecting mediocre instead of my experience here
0,went there twice in a week with clients because of its location and the fact that i really like their salads on both days i had to send my food back because there was a hair in it first time on the cheesecake  and the second time in the salad it's a definte must avoid for me now
0,unprofessional  from the moment you walk in at least one of the receptionists is pleasant another is a complete loud mouth and the things that come out of her mouth are absolutely rude and ridiculousthanks to "loud mouth" i've learned (in detail) that the director of nursing at this facility is having an affair with one of the male staff members  can you imagine waiting to greet your loved one and learning about such shenanigans  all from your seat in receptionthis combined with very poor bed-side mannerisms and the fact that i've met this don (and she is horribly unfriendly) told me that the facility is not fit to care for my mother and we pulled her out after just a few monthsplease do your loved ones a favor do not send them to this sham
0,father was a resident in this nursing home for almost two years  the care he received was inconsistent and disappointing to say the least  i found that some staff members were professional and caring but the majority of the cnas who interact with the patients on a daily basis were unprofessional and severely lacking in bedside manners i strongly recommend exploring other facilities if you are in need of care for yourself or a loved one  there are places out there with caring competent staff members that far exceed tlc in quality  this place has so-so reviews on medicaregov  they may be able to check basic boxes but when it comes to personalized attention and compassion they have a long way to go
0,unprofessional and sketchy staff - all the other yelp reviews will confirm thisyou know a nursing home is bad when you call to get information on your family member who is receiving care and the rudeilliterate nurse you get a hold of refuses to identify themselves - won't even give you their first name  what kind of nursing home hires people like thatlater we found out my family member ended up hospitalized due to dehydration  they refused to assist my family get information about his care after he was "discharged" - that was the word they kept throwing around even to my family member while he was still there waiting for an ambulanceif you are considering placing a family member in this facility read these reviews and also this news story: http:www8newsnowcomstory23140454nursing
0,know wherehow to start this review - i will start with if you can find any other place to send your family members for care it would be in your best interest to do so  my moms insurance company gave her no choice to go here  repeatedly i arrive to visit her and she is in a wet diaper and has been for a very long time due to the smell i lost my cool and a nice person (wish i could remember her name great smile not a nurse someone with authority) told me should would find someone to help  she stopped a man in the hall and he gave her instructions to find a nurse  later i found out this man was the administrator and he passed my need for help onto someone else  in a nutshell don't bother making a complaint the director of nursing will not return phone calls her name is donna and the nurse who told me her name told me not to tell anyone that she told me her name as she would be fired i could go on but it makes me more angry to think about it positves clean facility allows healthy pets to visit decent food cons unhappy nurses poor care no one who can help will listen at the management level
0,am giving this place zero stars  my grandmother was sent to this hell hole to build and regain strength after being at tlc for almost 10 days  my grandma had been vomiting large amount of green vomit for days her blood pressure was finally checked and it was so low they rushed her to er my grandma is now laying in icu with the worst pneumonia one can have all of this is caused by lack of staff members doing what they are paid to do ( care for the patients) when my grandma arrived at the er photos were taken of her bed sores and amounts of green vomit my grandma was severely dehydrated mal nourished  and know where near where  the recovery she should have beenaccording to several staff members at the hospital my grandma is currently at say that tlc is well known for all of their neglect i will go to my grave fighting to have tlc's doors closed and pray that all staff members get what they deserve when they need care somedayi am aware that when we get older we will pass there is no reason to take years away from anyone due to laziness this place has messed with the wrong family this time
0,being admitted to this facility my elderly friend received a few days treatment and then was constantly badgered to sign into a hospice facility called solari she was told by tlc that she could stay there up to 100 days then suddenly after less than 2 weeks she was told she had to leaveperiod no notice once again the solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in solari moved her the following day tlc on site social worker was usually no where to be found and never returned her calls or the many pages the receptionist made for her stating "i know she's here i don't know why she's not responding"avoid this place at any costs
0,place has unmotivated staff whom are mostly not happy or caring to the residents their standards are poor and utterly sad for any human being do not waste your breath here
0,father passed away early this week at the silver ridge healthcare center after a 9 year bout with cancer it was his dying wish not to pass at home while he was in home hospice care so when the medical staff tending to him announced that he only had hours left arrangements were made to have him transferred to a hospice based facility i hope and pray that if you (the reader) are ever faced with sending a family member or friend to a facility like this - that you have other options because silver ridge is one of the worst facilities i've encountered after years of working in healthcare i waited a few days to post this so it wouldn't seem like an emotional response to my father's passing - i truly hope that no one ever has to experience what i experienced hereto start off - i could have raised hell but that wasn't my purpose for being there i was there with my family to be with my father in his last remaining hours but from the moment i stepped foot into the facility i encountered the most cold uncaring and unprofessional staff ever i intentionally used the word "encountered" because not one person ever approached my family not one asked if we needed anything not one offered any explanation of the procedures and or rules of the facility not one gave us the time of day when coming by to check his vitals or drop off equipment which incidentally was never used it was so bad that when the transport team arrived to transfer my father to his assigned bedroom - one of them had to go and hunt down a tree so they could connect the oxygen lines when i finally wanted to know what the hell was going on i find three of their staff just sitting at the station having a non work related conversation there were problems with the meds that my father was prescribed but it wasn't entirely the facility's fault - but no one on their staff took the initiative to try to remedy the situation meds at facility are brought in via a mobile pharmacy team however all facilities have systems in place for meds they need stat and this place was not exception after a brief conversation with the admitting nurse and some pointed accusations about how inept their staff was coming across - she managed to contact the right people to pull the meds from their pyxis machine that had the meds my father was prescribed in stock almost two hours after my father was placed at one point one of the nurses came in to take my father's vitals both my sister and i were sitting bedside and not only didn't she even greet us or explain what she was doing - when asked what his stats were she didn't even answer - she only turned the monitor so i could see the readout the patient next door - didn't speak english i don't know what language he spoke however the staff on the third shift had zero patience for dealing with him at one point one of the nurses was arguing with him because of the language barrier i don't understand how someone in healthcare doesn't know how to use the free translation services offered to help prevent circumstances like what i witnessed that night it's a matter of a making a toll free call i could go on about this place however there were some things you would just have to see for yourself for example the unsanitary restrooms - where soiled adult diapers were overflowing from the trash cans onto the floor there were also some spills that weren't cleaned from the patients who had the pleasure of roaming the halls i will close on this - when my father passed not one word was said to my family by the staff it's not like there wasn't time nor opportunity waiting for the mortuary service to pick him up took about 90 minutes even the transport driver was sympathetic enough to offer condolences i remained silent about what i witnessed first hand at first this isn't the only arena i intend on voicing my concerns i over see hospital operations on a much larger level than this facility but the term "healthcare" should be universal everywhere until the facility's management address the issues here i'd recommend you avoid this place if you need to place a loved one there for care
0,find it absolutely amazing that a person can pass away at their facility - then one day short of 7 weeks later someone from that facility is calling for the deceased asking to speak with them regarding paperwork that needs to be completed that's definitely a textbook procedure of making sure the family of the deceased isn't reminded of the passing - also just goes to show how uninvolved the clinicalnursing staff was with my dad's brief stay and passing at this facility seeing as no one from that facility gave me nor my family any attention - that they would miss that someone actually passed away or who it was i'd save a copy of the voice mail and send it to the facility administrators or the risk management team - however with the attitudes and behavior i witnessed from their staff there that night - and now with the voice mail i just listened to - i'm sure they wouldn't carei'm moving on and putting this all behind me after this review i'd suggest that you just keep moving on if you ever find this place as an option for care - for yourself anyone you know or love and even your enemies
0,this facility - some of the staff are great - but asst director of nursing phyllis visconte is horrible and should have her license revoked she is apathetic and impossible to deal with - and truly needs to find a new profession am filing complaints against her with all agencies - under her watch my mother was abused and neglected bad news
0,mother-in-law was there for 9 days and they nearly killed her very few competent people thereand many have very bad attitudesplease do your research don't send your loved one hereupdatethe hospital couldn't undo the damage done by this lousy placewe lost her 5 days later
0,is a somewhat older facility but we went with this one given the staggeringly bad reviews the other one got my grandma in law fell from being weak from a uti and had to be transferred to a rehabilitation to recover and get stronger  it seemed really great at first but it was the luck of the draw we got a really lovely rn and cna team the first few days and then the shifts changed overall the care for someone who can't ask for help as well as others was inadequate  there were some wonderful people along the way that we really liked and we expressed so much gratitude to them for their kindness then there was the polar opposite that have yelled at us for requests that i feel were reasonable one lady go mad at being told to be more gentle with grandma as she fell and being turned so quickly hurts one got mad at being asked an hour later if she got the ice water and can change grandma before leaving when we've been there for 12 hours and want to go home and said so when making the request i would hope to get stuff in a reasonable time not an hour later ask to be yelled at that not everything can happen at a snap of demands world doesn't revolve around us some things can't be helped i'm not unreasonable i've heard complaints down the hall of how spread thin people can be too many people assigned to a person - i sympathize and not ok with how the bottom dollar comes into play with quality care it fucks staff and patients if you can speak for yourself and press your button then you'll be fine if you can speak for yourself also be considerate of how much time you take for your trivial bs one of our neighbors was a princess and spent so much time demanding and berating the staff that maybe if they didn't get beatdown they would care more and have more time for what mattersi think though even in that prioritize when someone has a uti and is too weak to get up don't leave them in their waste all night grandma got some serious rashes from thisand things didn't change with some people it's totally not ok that it takes us being posted up at the rehab to make sure she was being cared forthe weekend director was wonderful and when she was around my mil got somewhere with asking for some better priority treatment of the rashes and to get grandma on ivs and better meds the physical therapist did all they can daily their case worker is a very sweet woman that lead us down to hospice as a optionat the end of it we saw she was in pain and giving up on us the person who came in declined and didn't want this anymore we made the decision to bring her to hospice for adequate care our thought process is they would take better care of her there and discharge her to at home comfort care i think her spirit was broken she didn't want to go on and she left us 48 hours after leaving this facility and was thanking us for getting her out after the hospice immediately did in 11 minutes what didn't happen here for 11 days there they bathed her made her comfortable the moment she arrived of course the maybes play into my head if we had better care from the start i think she would have been better off
0,performance is a clean and well equipped physical therapy clinic in tempe the staff are friendly but they are overloaded with patients and give you very little attention the owner is pretty arrogant and is very flirtatious with some of the female clients he barely listened to me when i came in and had me continue doing exercises that i told him were causing me pain until i ended up with a bad injury from the physical therapy months later i am still injured and never received so much as an apology i would never recommend functional performance to anyone
0,is a good therapist very professional i totally recommend her on the other hand derek (who is the owner) does not take enough time to find out about his patients' condition and give them an appropriate treatment i got a bad injury while receiving pt under his supervision and his excuse was that he had a lot of patients at that time and that me coming to pt at that hour was not the best idea why did they schedule me and all those other patients in the first place if the therapist can't deal with that all i got from him was an apology and an even worse injury
0,sante like the plague  they do not care about their patients and are only interested in your money  my grandma has copd and went to sante after having been hospitalized a few days to "build back up her strength" well the complete opposite happened  they lied to us and did not inform us that no one on staff knew how to use a bipap machine; therefore after being there a couple of days her co2 levels rose and her oxygen levels declined sending her right back to the hospital  after she was back doing well and could be released from the hospital once again sante apologized for the incident and assured us that they would now know how to properly work it and care for her  we mistakenly once again had her go there  she was doing great; however they were not able to work the bipap yet again and did nothing to get another machine or anything  after being there a week and off the bipap my grandma went downhill overnight  we told them that she needed to go to the hospital; however they did not take us seriously  they did not allow my grandma to go to the hospital as she was asking to go along with us  they told her that she did not want to go to the hospital because you know what happens there  well they neglected to even call 911 even when in the middle of the night her oxygen levels dropped into the 60's  nothing got done until my dad went by the next morning and immediately told them to call the ambulance  they listened only because they thought that he was a dr  they were clueless and didn't even know who the dr's were just as they are clueless when it comes to providing care  all that they were good for was popping pills down my grandma's throat  all thanks to sante my grandma is worse off now than before and is fighting for her life this very moment  i highly suggest avoiding sante at all costs  they lie don't care properly for their patients and are only money hungry  if you love your loved one do not allow them to so much as set a foot in this facility
0,now understand where the name comes from yesterday i went into dick's to buy my daughter some shirts as we were checking out i noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs i started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package it said things like " missing manual or dead battery" i found a watch that was missing a manual i went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for i purchased the watch as is and took it home after trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour i went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital i went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on i was told that i had to speak to nicole the store manager i was directed to nicole who was assisting another customer after standing patiently waiting for nicole while the customer and nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones i got annoyed i went back to the counter to find a different manager i was told that nicole is it i waited some more after waiting for nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me i explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in   i pointed out that as people look through the bag   watches are being mixed up i showed her timex watches with polar band and bags with two watches and no bands some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps after going through each bag i could not find the correct band someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band i asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference nicole said no i get "as is" but i purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual it did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and datenow i have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watchpissed of morrison family ymca soccer dad
0,been to several dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst a few years ago i took my mountain bike to them for a basic service upon picking it up i realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor i brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that i was wrong and they don't do that i asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff i asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either i took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologizedi since stopped frequenting them sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areai had to visit this location again recently i had a backpack on as i rode there in my motorcycle i walked in the store and started headed to the department i was needing i was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me i could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues i told her that i had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule i also informed her that there was no signage stating that as i walked in the store she continued to state that i could either give them my backpack or i could leave the storei told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as i did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in itthis brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant they are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetici wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area
0,poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurelsif you have breast cancer the last thing you need is poor service and pushy sales clerks i would give no stars if that were an option stay away
0,pushy i went with my mother who is fighting cancer  i was shocked at how pushy they were with her they are taking advantage of cancer patients
0,i had a terrible experience at monona's village pedaler i arrived at 10am as the shop opened i needed to simply pump up a tire on my nephew's bike i had trouble getting to the air value due to a spoke that was a little to snug to the value very simple issuei walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed another white lady and a white gentleman came in after me the first lady bike was serviced i was clearly next the guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me it was clear that i was next but he didn't serve me i patiently waiting thinking something was strange he then asked me what i needed i explained and we walked to the pump he started to pump the air into the value stopped 12 way through and went to help the white gentleman he just left me standing there he got a set of tires for the man and left me wondering what i had done i walked back in the shop wondering what was going on i stood next to the gentleman as the worker charged the man's credit card in the front of the store the customer looked at me and apologized for the man working he thanked me for my patience and went along again we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire i proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too he refused to do it telling me that i 'should know how to do it' he told me that 'this is a simply life skill that i should already know how to do' huh i said 'in your professional opinion would you suggest that i add more air to the tire' he replied with a short crisp snotty attitude "you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air do it" wowand he walked back in the store leaving me by myself i'm serious i stood there shocked and wondering what was happeningi am an african american professional who wanted to take my nephew on his first monona-lake bike ride i didn't deserve service like this if you don't support discriminatory business stay away from this shop he didn't need to treat me with such disregard they don't deserve your money stay away and tell your friends to not support this shop
0,was purchasing a book for a class that i was unsure about staying in while checking out i asked the sales clerk what the return policy was and she completely ignored me i asked a second time and she acted like i wasn't there and continued ringing me up my friend who was with me in line sees slips of paper behind the register with the return policy on it and takes one since it was obvious that the cashier was not going to speak to us and points out that the return deadline for all text books was a few weeks away i complete the transaction and leave after i drop the class and try to return the unused book two days later i'm told that the item is nonreturnable the manager pointed out the fine print in the return policy that listed many types of books that were nonreturnable there were many paragraphs of text on their return policy and the part that listed the deadline for book returns was no where near the part that stated my book was nonreturnable i pointed out that the cashier completely ignored my question about the return policy and the manger beaming with pride tells me that they train their employees to not answer any questions about their return policy i don't need to explain how absurd that is he goes on to explain that they "[] expect our customers to know how to read" what does tis expect us to know how to read the lengthy return policy that is not provided to the purchaser until *after* they check out unless they simply reach around the register and take one there are very good reasons why they don't provide the policy to customers--even when asked besides being able to sell books to students unsure about staying in their classes--if even a small number of customers took the time to read the lengthy return policy before they check out the line would be hours long rather than the mere 45 minutes that it took for us tis is as sleazy as they come save some money and order online
0,wish i could give 0 stars two days ago i purchased an iclicker here for $5750 including tax this afternoon i attempted to return the unopened product with the original receipt i was told they could offer me $1900 for it as it was considered a "textbook" (for the record an iclicker is an electronic device made of plastic and metal and made up of 0% paper) and therefore not eligible for return after august despite the fact that i had purchased it in september and not during august at all the cashier who checked me out at the time of purchase also did not inform me that i would not be able to return it in short horrible customer service and i feel they take advantage of basically broke college students thanks for nothing tis and i will be telling everyone i know not to shop here
0,place is horrible  the service is very rude  they refused to put letters on a shirt for me because i had my own letters even though i would have paid for the service  it was a really weird experience
0,boyfriend and i both had terrible experiences here gus' attitude is - well special if you can handle it great - otherwise why should anyone have to deal with it after all aren't we the customers  the prices are outrageousand finally - i had 2 dresses that i entrusted to them for adjustments let's say - they are both completely unusable why well my butt is nearly exposed on one of the dresses (not exaggerating) and the other - is terriblei would not recommend them to anyone very very truly disappointed as i could use a good honest knowledgeable helpful tailor seamstress
0,ready for my friend wedding they seems to be very friendly so i trust them of fitting me a suiti pick it up after 2 weeksbut when i got home pant hem is short of 1 inch and sleeves is short i told them i want my shirt to show at least a 14
0,start i have seen this shop many times as i frequent two great restaurants next door  a few months ago my fiance and i stopped into the store to get an idea on a suit for me for our up coming wedding  we first met the son who was very nice and knowledgeable  i recently returned to the shop when it was time to finally purchase a suit as our wedding is getting close  i was helped by maragita and sold a nice suit she initially gave me a good deal and i felt satisfied with the experience  let me tell you how things changed once they've got your money the suite was ordered from the manufacturer and arrived about ten days later when i went to pick it up i tried it on for any necessary alterations  i was quoted an extra $115 to make it fit  now i understand all suits need some alterations but this was major work needed  i took the suit to get some comparison quotes to fit it which were cheaper  i decided to return to the shop to see if the would work with me in coming to an arrangement since i was not happy with the way the experience was going  a $200 suit now was costing me $315 when i was under the impression that any alterations were included  i expressed my displeasure with margarita who became very defensive  i explained that i felt lead a stray in buying the suit since i tried the pants on in front of her and she knew how much alterations the would need  i understand that alterations are time consuming and people aren't going to work for free   i suggested a 50% discount and offered to pay $65 to meet me in the middle  she did not accept this and was unwilling to work with me at all in satisfying my displeasure  she even had the attitude that it was some how my fault for not knowing how these things work  i informed her that she wasn't really doing much to keep me business and she stated that she had many happy customers and didn't need my return business  customer service and satisfaction is not a concern for this store  margarita had no interest in trying to win my repeat business once they have your money you're own your own i would not suggest this shop to anyone
0,do not recommend this place i gave them 2 chances both times they were unprofessional and unorganized
0,me start this review by saying if i could give this place a negative 5 star rating i would this store and it's owner are the biggest ripoff i've seen in many years you go here to get suit's for the biggest day of your life you set up the groomsmen party and discuss pricing everything is supposed to be all set for pick up right before your big day right wrong the day before my wedding  we go in to pick up the suit's and when we go to pay for the rental's the owner mikka does a bait and switch we were quoted a price of 84$ for kids 12 and under and 125$ for anyone older the owner and sales associate both claim they never said that now i'm in a rock and a hard place i felt helpless knowing i didn't have anymore time to go anywhere else the owner mikka was shaking in disgust that i would even challenge her now keep in mind i had 10 men and 4 boys in my party( 2 little boy's aged 2 and a 9 and 12 year old) i asked her again "why was she trying to charge full price for children" she then said " the lower price was for size 12 and under not age" so i was forced to pay the full price and left felling helplessness  i reached out to my cc company who to no avail told me there hands were tied because it was a verbal agreement not a written oneso at the end of the day i'm left with this bill and a taste so bad in my mouth about this store and the owner buyer beware go to another store one that will honor there verbal agreements i will never shop with this store again and i recommend you do the same
0,your money  you get quoted one price and get charged way more happened not just once but twice  not worth it
0,at first impression is like meeting that perfect guy who claims to be self-made  successful businessman who built his company from scratch and single-handedly remembers all the details  well then it turns out that the kid's really a trust-fund baby who has a housekeeper an assistant a cook to help him and yet he's still barely holding himself togetheri was impressed with stitched too when i first laid eyes on the store  that prime real estate at the cosmo those smooth-talking salespeople the sprinkle of designer labels and of course that man cave in the back with the shiny leather couches and the scotch cabinetthe mr has been wanting a bespoke suit for a while now and stitched came close to his heart's desire  after all they showed us ermenegildo zegna cloth poured us espresso and talked fast  i have a keen eye for shopping and luxury goods but being that this was an experience for the mr i asked my ocd self to take a vacation so he can shop in peace  that was a mistakewe purchased a suit a jacket and 2 pairs of pants all together ringing the bill up to almost a hefty chunk of money the alterations themselves about being 50 times more than i've ever paid   after missing the first delivery date of the clothes (both of the pants were the wrong length and width as well as the jacket) here we are after barely 3 wears of the clothes and the alterations are coming apart  it is a worst tailor job that i've ever seen the hemming haphazardly finished and many shortcuts in sewing taken  i can pay about 5% as much and take them somewhere else to have a better jobgo to stitched if you're buying something that they've bought from another place (like cufflinks or pocket handkerchiefs) if you don't mind paying more and already have your bottle of scotch parked in their cabinet  don't let that designer fabric selection fool you the in-house construction will be very inferior  and in the end what good is luxury bricks if the build of the house is terrible
0,this place when i realized last minute that my maid of honor dress no longer fit and needed to be taken out the tailor told me over the phone it wouldn't be a problem and would cost $45 got to the store tried the dress on and the guy said he could change the zipper back to a corset back for $75 i agreed as i was leaving town for the wedding in 3 days and was desperate i changed out of the dress and all of the sudden it was now going to cost $175 to alter the dress really could he have made it anymore obvious that he was trying to take advantage of me since he knew i was leaving in a few days and needed the dress again i agreed out of desperation then some other guy walks over talks to the tailor in another language before laughing walking out and the tailor telling me he can no longer fix the dress because he doesn't have enough time and he's too busy are you kidding meavoid this place they are shady and think they can jerk around their customers just because they are in the cosmo newsflash the cosmo is barely surviving which means this place will sooner or later be shut down too
0,waste your money  bought an $1800 suite here last september and it's already falling apart in less than 1 year  it's literally falling apart  the fabric is worn in the crotch and the seams are showing severe signs of wear and tear  i've never had it dry cleaned and have only wore it 3-4 times per month in the last 10 monthsi was initially reluctant to purchase from stiched in the first place because of their shady reviews regarding their tailoring  when i addressed these issues to their staff prior to my purchase the sales man used phrases like "we have new tailors" "those are old reviews" and "we now have the best tailors on the strip" don't be fooled  when trying to come to an amicable resolution with the manager 10 months later he too said "i'm sorry and we stand behind our product"  this was bs because he didn't care about resolving this issue in a reasonable manner  shame on you stiched  i've had suits from the men's wearhouse that have lasted much longer the only resolution that the manager offered was that he'd sell me another pair of pants (that won't match the existing jacket) at a discounted price  i'm sorry but this is completely unacceptable  i will never buy from stiched again nor would i recommend you gamble with their product
0,the tailor in the store is not associated with stitched; they are - separate company but either way still horrible
0,restrooms looked like after an bombardment an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices highly questionable hygiene for a food storedisgusting i will not go back until they clean up the place it's just filthy
0,been going to the pennsylvania macaroni company for years love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses always great service however today was the exception rudest woman at the cheese counter then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty she was covering the pasta at 4:00 they close at 4:30 and i asked her if it was to late to get pasta she rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now a simple yes or no would have been nice i said ok thanks anyway then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something in a very rude voice needless to say i walked away wow pennsylvania macaroni company needs to work on customer service obviously she hates her job then get another one if i didn't drive so far to get there i wouldn't have written this review every january i buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members i won't be doing that anymore
0,by this market was actually looking for the u pick peaches place  went into the store some of the veggies looked old  found 2 strawberries & a couple tomatoes went to the counter checked out and she said $301 but the store charges $50 to use a debit or credit card so it was $351 i said oh i did not see that i have cash in my purse and the lady said it already went through  i explained i did not know they charged a fee and she spouted off it cost me $90 and very unprofessional said do you want your $50 back i understand business & costs and this is one i will now avoid
0,great food some very old shelf food and some miserable people behind the counteri can't recall a place that had more unfriendly people waiting on you  they apparently hate working here  i can't blame them  they are cramped up inside this small space that looks like something out of alfred hitchcock's film spellboundi once accidentally asked for a certain number year cheddar and they about pulled a gun out from under the counter and shot me  "what  there is no such thing"  my mistake i mean 7 year cheddar  i  had accidentally used the price in place of the yearnever a thank you never a friendly chit chat at check out  here ya go  ugghh  i really hate this place but the cheese and sausage are goodapparently i wrote this when the place was closed for repairs   didn't mean to add insult to injury   but my comments were on the staff not so much the food   i am hopeful that all of the old shelf food went up in flames   if i return i won't worry about what i buy from the shelf   what i said about the staff is true   i have never seen a smile in this place
0,left early from arizona opera lucia di lammermoor it was horrible i felt like i was at a high school production their is no sound production and the performers do not wear mikes so you are in a fairly large hall (the symphony hall to be exact) and all you can hear are these tiny voices from the stage i could've had the same experience watching it on my ipad do not waste your hard earned money they should be ashamed to pretend this is a true opera
0,i should update my last experience concerning the volunteering situation at ballet az  i waited a couple of years and went back and offered my services  must have been my instincts because i delayed sending them the paperwork  just as well because i was told soon after they "rescinding" their offer to have me do volunteer work with them  this happened awhile back now but last i heard the same people are handling that area so doubt if things have changed any  you be the judge
0,unimpressed with the dress rehearsal that we paid $5 ticket and didn't even bother going  after a 12 week class 12 the kids didn't even know what they were doing and what they were doing was very little dancing and more waving hands in the air and spinning in circles  tried to get our $ back on the tickets and they wouldn't but it still wasn't worth going  videotaped and sent to grandparents and even they were like "really that was it"
0,over zealous life grds  won't even let you float on your back  lifeguards are power monger idiots here  i was a 10 year lifeguard and they are not trained or professional
0,i'm going to start out by saying i know we are in a recession and money is tight but this was the worst mini golf course that i have ever seen i loved that when we walked in all the arcade games were shut off and didn't workprobably because our round of mini golf only costed $12 for the 2 of us we proceeded to the course which was a total joke the turf was totally beat up the staging and props looked condemned and at one point i smelt something that resembled a dead body or animal at one point i bet this was a nice place but the ponds that went thru the course were all dried up and not working and everything was a mess it wasn't enjoyable and we were very disappointed spend the extra couple dollars and go to crackerjax or castle n coasters
0,do get what you pay for  had a convention in scottsdale and wanted to find something more reasonable then the scottsdale resorts  happened upon the scottsdale athletic club and it looked great  the price was slammin' so i encouraged a colleague and client to get reservationsthe rooms had all the charm of motel 6  i was really disappointed and embarrassed for my client  found myself saying i'm sorry over and over again  hope i can save some fellow yelpers from the same experience
0,feel bad for the people who get suckered into this place after seeing their photoshopped pictures online  this place is on par with a days inn and is by no means a resortmy issue was the ownership and staff  if you want to feel like you are the biggest inconvenience to walk through the front door then this is your place also i have no idea how their gym survives they discourage gym-only membership and the fees are ridiculous ($549 initiation fee plus $100 monthly fee)  i guess that's why the place is completely dead oh well the equipment is old anyways  anyways this place is a big nope nope nope nope
0,hotel is beyond disgusting- be sure to read the tripadviser reviews also if you book this through a discount place like i did (expedia) you will regret it janice at the front desk looks like a walmart shopper with a rude tone as well  we were shown a room (standard) that smelled like urine with one 2x3 window overlooking the parking lot the lobby had a used q-tip behind the chair and garbage strewn about place is worn and tired
0,don't know where to begin we checked in on a fri night in april the place was empty maybe 4-5 cars in entire placefront desk lady was talking to a guest on phone who wanted to come in that night instead of saturday and she told them they couldn't because there were no clean rooms we went to the coffee shop restaurant and the steak didn't taste right  didn't think too much about it until morning our room was dark lights are all dim and room is yellow & brown tones i had to sleep on the pull out sofa bed the sheets were dirty with crumbs could tell the bed was never madei slept on top of blanket in morning i got up to make coffee the pot was there but no coffee filters to be able to use the pottook a shower and only one towel in the whole place we had two booked in our room don't understand why one towel decided to go back to restaurant for breakfast how bad can you screw up breakfast and again place was empty but another couple were leaving they made a comment about the service said he ordered steak and eggs  but steak was bad and they were walking out he complained how his room had one towel  we said so did ours confirmation now the night before we thought steak tasted funny we overheard the waiter tell a table there is "no milk" they were out its 9am on a saturday morning  coffee came in a styrofoam cup in the restaurant  we walked out checked out they didn't charge us for the room after we showed them 5 old cigarette butts on our non smoking dirty room balcony and pictures of the bed sheets too bad has lots of potential but no service rooms are like an apartment but dreary pool looked okay but not sure where you would find a towel place looks like its being run on a dime budget and i wonder if the owner knows the person at front desk is turning guests away from checking in i would say there must be at least 75 rooms and literally there were maybe 10 cars in the parking lot in need of an overhaul front desk said manager would call us but he never did not a resort more like an old condo time share next to a tennis club
0,are much better and cheaper options for gyms in the tempe area  my biggest complaints are the lack of cleanliness and the overall condition the lobby and general areas all look nice but i've often found the locker rooms to be dirty additionally the cardio machines are often sticky and sweaty grosson the plus side the pool is great and it's large enough that finding a machine isn't a problem my biggest complaint has come after i cancelled my membership i get almost weekly calls letters and emails asking me to re-join i've asked to be removed from their mailing list but it doesn't seem to work somehow the message of "leave me alone i'm happy with my new gym" isn't getting through
0,been a member for over 5 years and i've noticed the last few months that this experiece has gotten disgusting  the towels smell like sweat the clocks have stopped nothing is cleaned the drinking fountains have stuff stuck to them some of the machines are in disrepair for more than 2 weeks and i could go on  i've decided to try to find a new gym because i don't want to get sick herebesides all that what's up with the toilet seat covers  they're there one week and gone the next  wthreally just venting because i'm really disappointed with what was a good gym
0,like the gym most of the time  except for the kid's club  if you have kids younger than school age  this gym is not for you  they have a time limit which they don't bother to mention prior to getting you to join  then if you "go over" 3 times  your membership is suspended   i have not even been able to go over to the weight lifting section of the gym after 3 weeks of membership - thanks to the kids club   also have to leave classes early which is disruptive ie in yoga again thanks to kids club  the girls who work there are snotty and make snide remarks if you are even a couple of minutes late    i have written a letter to "corporate" but i am told that i will never get a response   so once again as a single working mother with child i feel that i am paying more than the average person to work out there plus i am not able to work out as long as other people who pay less   completely frustrating   i signed up for 80000 worth of summer kids campswhich i have subsequently withdrawn from due to the bad attitude of the kid's club employees   so if you don't have kids the gym would be great
0,sells the spa as an incentive to the gym along with the kids play area the customer service at the spa was horrendous today jilian at lifetime spa has hands down worst customer service i have experienced in a long time  canceling appt eye rolling deep breathing to convey her frustrations don't work with ppl if you do not like the public
0,of this gym i put my membership on hold because of an injury and they said i still owe them money i finally said ok and went into pay and canceled my account i received an email for another bill that was still owe they told me i didn't sign something i said the employee never ask me to sign something oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very rude i will tell as many people as i know to never use lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common sense
0,gym has yet to return my call after charging me when i was not even using the gym they have very poor service please stop ripping people off
0,tried it for a few days and decided the high cost wasn't worth it to me  i cancelled my membership after 5 days well within the 7 day window  not only was i still charged for the initial month but also the following month as well  calls to the club gave no results so now i have to drive there and resolve this in person  horrible and non caring "customer service"  if you change your mind about lifetime good luck getting them to stop auto charging your credit card
0,experience for the past 20yrs i've always belonged to a gym this was the worst ever i started by signing up with a personal trainer (he was awesome) however i ended up having major hand surgery on both hands and was unable to finish my last 4 sessions after many attempts to speak to someone and i'm talking weeks for someone to get back with me ltf refused to reimburse me for he last 4 sessions i also feel like $120 a month for a single person is way over the limit especially for a gym that has out dated equipment i belonged to lowes ymca ($65 a month) and that gym makes ltf look like a dump
0,signed up for this gym over a year ago on a month by month basis  the gym and staff are great  however upon losing my job i was told i need to send a letter asking for cancellation   i sent the letter and it appeared the matter was over  they have continued to bill me $149month for over a year now  they send me to their collections department when i don't pay  each person i talk to on the phone says i need to mail a letter or they cant cancel  they also say that they need 30 days notice to cancel  this is a scam to keep you going from month to month and to keep taking your money   in total they have stolen $1500 from me and my family  i have contacted corporate and they say they have done nothing wrong and can't help  "the money is for access to they gym it doesn't matter that you haven't been to the gym in over a year  if you go here make sure you cancel in person and get something signed and dated from a manager
0,gm at the tempe location is absolutely horrible and has no clue what he's doing he's a baffoon and was supposed to be fired a long time ago
0,was dark inside the cages and the pitches were very inconsistent the guy in the cage next to me got beaned by a pitch no bueno
0,facility is big enough but that is kind of the only positive thing i can say  the ice is bad the price outrageous my main problem however is how bad it is for families  i've been to other facilities where we could bring an umbrella stroller (for a 1-year-old) but here-no dice  which is made more unfortunate because it's not posted anywhere  we had to show up to find out  they also don't have any walkers for inexperienced skaters-so two of my kids who were looking forward to it couldn't do much  at least my 7 year old had fun   i really did try to be nice to the employees when i suggested they put more on their website but they were apathetic teenagers who were less than helpful
0,are a lot of families here to skate tonight yet no one is here website says one time sign on office says another oh did i mention the flier in the lobby says another no times on their voicemail either disappointing this is our second time here today no one mentioned there was no public skating tonight they said they would be open
0,ice is bad this place is run downsome of the instructors need to remember that the customer pays money for lessons therefore pays their salary so they should loose the attitude that goes for pretty much everyone that works therethe ice den is soooooo much better

0,serious waste of time  if you happen to catch it while walking by then go for it but don't waste your time waiting around for this to happen
0,really wanted to like this place great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea the pictures on the website are beautifulwe found a grumpy old man at the front desk and he could not have been less interested in our arrival it felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key but the fun started when we returned later in the evening we found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present and i went back down to the old gentleman he stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer i waited suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not he also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollawayi slunk away with my guest who had by now come down too embarrassed and insulted it shouldn't be this way if this is personalized service i'd rather stay at a moteleven without grumpy old man there's nothing special about this place the rooms were ok but the bathrooms tiny (i guess they should be called showerrooms) everything else was sub-par the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful we did not dare try the free wine the hotel is in a bad neighborhoodfor the money find a special at the william penn on the omni hotels website if you want a boutique hotel try the inn on the mexican war streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the national aviary and that beautiful park the priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hasslepriory get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role
0,stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town our first impression was that pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area i find out later is one of the worst spots in the city)  the hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building  projects  ugh  great  then we were put into a "historical" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall moldy threadbare carpeting lumpy squeaky bed  i find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated  i asked to see the room and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee of course  about 50% more expensive  but i pay more because no way would i be able to exist in this old "historical" creepy room  finally a regular room-- the "renovated" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room  why even keep this historical old dingy dirty room  do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it bc they have no other choice i slept well in the "new" renovated room and would have been freaked out all night in the old room what a difference actually the bed and linens were very very comfortable  the bathroom was nice and clean  the room was what i expected a hotel room to be not high end four seasons but not cheap and nasty either the hotel obviously had availabilities of the new renovated rooms so why put us in an old unrenovated ugly old apartment looking room if they believed in upgrading then they would have at least gotten repeat business for those who are going to book here pay more for the new rooms or go somewhere else  the option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all  i don't think i will ever go back here if i ever go back to pittsburgh  i will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever  what is money except a means to be comfortable and live  i will spend more next timebreakfast was "eh"  it was free-- small stations of some fruit cheese small pastries cereal yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon  oj cranberry milk and coffee also available  honestly i felt like i was in college and watching my pennies (poor) staying here
0,at a beautiful wedding  staff was terrible unpleasant and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills  nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the "people" at the priory are cold miserable and just plain miserable i get better guest service at holiday inn
0,decided to have a little staycation at the priory earlier this month  my husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night  with the special they give you a few pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant  when my husband called the priory they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time  we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying  but the main issue was we checked in talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at meat and potatoes and she set us up with the shuttle  we go in the room look around for the $50 voucher and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with meat and potatoes when they  made our reservation  we had a fabulous dinner at m&p great food great service and the bill comes  we asked the server about this priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out  we called the priory and told them this the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it  then refused to call m&p to talk to the manager  she just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel  we gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this  he took our word that the priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill  it was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money just the service with the priory  this showed us two things: we won't be going back to the priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we will be going back to m&p because their service was impeccable
0,to a high tea here on sunday  although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming the food was nothing special in fact it was bad  we were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad which was bland (i make a better version at home) chicken salad nothing special either and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite  unfortunately it was the size of a quarter it was literally a bite  but it was the best part of the meal  (i don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread)we were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog   neither was anything special eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoeverthen the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like vanilla pastry shop  a pumpkin torte again fine  and a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone  it looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white mouse separated from brownie  yuck  oh yeah--i had a delicious tea from harney and sons (used to be sold at the grand floridian high tea in disney world) cinnamon spice  unfortunately when i asked for more tea they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag i've gone to various teas so i feel i can give a good comparison  not impressed at all  will not go back there ever
0,deleted my review of sunnyledgeback in april i met a girl for drinks at the sunnyledge  we had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu  when we arrived there however it was a different story  we were met at the door by the hostess (i presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were therewe shrugged it off and went to the bar  the bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs he acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for miss universe pageant constestants  and that's saying somethingthe bartender would disappear for long periods of time during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen  mostly the sounds of silverware banging around  it was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on  we were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times  most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen  even when it came time to get our check it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my cardterrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place  i have no plans on returningi hope this isn't deleted again and if it is i will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around sunnyledge and use every contact i have to get this printed in the post gazette and city paper  i have the means i have the will
0,the barwhile looking for places to have easter brunch i saw the sunnyledge appear several times in my searching they no longer do easter brunch but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about i should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old but i threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a friday eveningjust getting off work i came alone the location is a historical landmark a mansion built in 1889 and is the reason they deserve their single star the mansion from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass the furniture is elegant but not stuffy and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted the bar is rather small housing four 2-seat tables a 4-top and about 8 spaces at the bar behind the bar light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles the top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughouti browsed the martini menu not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter or too far from a martini(tequila cointreau and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that jose cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita) i stuck with the classic then and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish it was made quickly and without love shaking instead of stirring and putting it in an un-chilled glass not that there was much to love while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel banker's club is the gin of choice here and burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu the martini came(not filled to the top seems they measure precisely to include garnish) strong with little vermouth but given the alcohol devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrusi found as i drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant even though signage was still in place throughout the building i quietly finished my drink and closed my tab how much did my room temperature banker's club cost a cool $9it appears that somewhere between the last two years and now this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management if you are staying at the hotel and need a drink hop a cab to walnut street at least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink
0,was one of the vendors that came highly recommended by my wedding planner she could not stress enough how great and accommodating they were from our first meeting with their event coordinator we were lead to believe that mhi would offer outside catering if they were not able to customize our menu we wanted traditional laotian food they said that this was possible and so we signed everything that transpired from that moment went downhill they did not keep their promise and so we had to work with the chef to prepare our dishes after several tastings that we were billed for (it was never stated on our contract  that we had to pay for these) the food came out ok the final straw was 2 weeks before our wedding when we got the bill that was to be paid in full  which was completely inaccurate they tried to explain to us and our wedding planner what the breakdown of cost was but nothing on that invoice made sense my planner told us to hold off on paying until she spoke to billy the owner she also mentioned that they had allowed a couple to pay on the day of so we should be ok after several back and forth we decided to proceed on the payment even though we didn't agree with the amount  mhi planner emailed us midday and said the owner billy would not accept our credit card and demanded we paid him cash or money order in full or our event would be cancelled we told him that the contract explicitly states that a cc is an acceptable form of payment and that he could take he said that he would take us to court and sue us if we didn't pay we were under the notion that he was going to cancel our event bc we refused to give in to his demands but two days later he ran our credit card wo our knowledge and called our planner to let us know all is well & that we could have our wedding day we never got our money back and we ended up not having our wedding there i don't think any bride & groom who endured what we did would want to have their wedding there as well we had to find a new venue at the last minute and rejigger our wedding day schedule because of billy folks - there is something sketchy when a business owner demands you pay in cash when the contract doesn't state that please beware of this i have all of our correspondences saved if anyone wants to see them
0,posted 792010:just wanted to warn yelpers about this place we made reservations in march for an october wedding party and were told today (july 6) that everyone's reservations have been cancelled the bride-to-be was told that a higher-paying party had reserved that date and that literally "that's life" they have an f rating with the better business bureau now we all know whyedit 9182012:i'd like to thank dave for the sincere apology i've received here on yelp two years and nearly three months after the fact
0,planning a wedding in pittsburgh from san francisco i've asked the owners for information 3 times by email and had my mother call them the owner refuses to give any price information until you or a family comes to see the property in person i'm a little offended at how the owner feels my time is just available to go look at his venue before i even know if the place is within my budget it is difficult enough to plan a wedding from across the country to begin with but when the owners of a venue won't even send you info it makes it all the more difficult the photos make the place look really gorgeous but the other reviews on here must ring true if the owner won't even show you the costs first
0,boggs mansion (now called the inn on the mexican war streets) was grand enough and tastefully decorated  we could have lived with the cold cookies popcorn and cheap candies put out for snack; or even the lack of basic room service perhaps we should have felt "warned" the first evening when we were escorted to our room and told that we could put out the "maid please service the room" sign but that we shouldn't count on anything happening  perhaps we should have been "warned" when the innkeeper manically scribbled all over a map while "explaining" what to see and how to get around in that neighborhood  no doubt we should have been more alert to what we were being charged up front for our 5 night reservation because the innkeeper wildly disclaimed ability to use a calculator and insisted on doing the sums by hand with a pencil and paper  as a result we were immediately overcharged by $11166  from the amount we had agreed to in writing several months before  all of this was not what we expected and as trusting "guests" who wanted to have an enjoyable time we ignored the "issues" and let the eccentricities slide that first night  as others have written in their reviews the breakfast is a self-serve affair which was your basic budget hotel big-box store fare with the exception of some yogurt hard-boiled eggs and a bowl of aging frozen mixed fruit  all of this was counter indicated by anything we've experienced in bed and breakfast establishments in the past but we were trying to have a good time and not make a fuss  however my husband and i both work from our computers when we are traveling and i had specifically asked well in advance about wifi and internet connection before i made our reservation to stay for 5 nights at the inn  i had been assured that there was wifi and that it was free of charge it says this in all the online ads for the hotel as well needless to say we were taken aback the first night of our stay when it took us a long time to connect to the internet and only when we figured out that we had to use a very old connection protocol  when consulted the innkeeper claimed he personally didn't have much use for the internet and was fairly indifferent to our requests for a decent internet connection  on the second night when we returned to our unserviced room we discovered that there was no internet connection at all  i went in search of karl the innkeeper to help us but he was nowhere to be found  after struggling with the problem for quite a while we gave up on trying to get any business done via internet the next morning while i was fetching our coffee and pastries from the breakfast area karl appeared  i very politely told him the situation with the internet and asked if he would call the internet service provider to find out why there was no internet service to the house  at first karl simply seemed indifferent and told me that our room could always get internet  about two minutes later out of the clear blue he was screaming at me from the stair landing that i "didn't know what it's like to work for a living because you've led a privileged life could do anything you want and had never worked a day in your life"  i stood in shock with the creamer in my hand over the folgers  never in my life have i encountered such outrageous presumptive insults; and certainly not from the host of a hotel to whom i'd paid good money to provide reasonable services and a comfortable time  my husband witnessed this scene from the top of the stairs  when i returned quit shaken to our room we discussed the situation and agreed that we should leave  after packing our traveling gear my husband went in search of the innkeeper to explain that we would be leaving due to his intolerable behavior and to request a refund for the three nights remaining  after several minutes of calling all over the house for him karl finally crept out of a downstairs door  my husband made his requests and within seconds we both witnessed him fly into an insane rage once again screaming nonsense which included insults of both of us and our home state slamming doors multiple times and then reopening the doors in order to follow us around while screaming at us to get out  he only barely managed to come up with a refund slip although it was for the wrong amount and was not processed correctly because of the faulty internet connection and because of his unwillingness to use a calculator for doing sums  this whole scene and situation wasted many hours of a day of our long-anticipated vacation in pittsburgh but we were both happy to get away from so much insult and outrage  we certainly would never recommend that anyone stay at the inn on the mexican war streets
0,- just to respond to jeff s's comments and claims: (1) at no time were we told that the internet was out and would stay out just because the other innkeeper was not there to fix it  we were told repeatedly that the connection in our assigned room always worked and that we were free to try other rooms  it didn't work at all anywhere in the inn the 2nd night  (2) we were never offered assistance in finding another hotel in the area  when we left the inn we had to go to mcdonald's to get an internet connection in order to research other hotel possibilities for the 3 nights we were displaced (3) the second night we were the only guests in the inn so there was no one else there to be "understanding"  we were only informed about the death in karl's family as he was demanding that we leave while screaming at us about being "privileged" and from california   (4) we were charged $11166 too much up front for the 5 nights when we arrived for our stay at the inn  to date we are still waiting for that amount to be refunded  it is certainly not true that we received a refund for the nights we stayed although we feel that kind of refund would be entirely appropriate considering the harsh treatment and lack of services  we are sorry that the innkeepers see this as "an inconvenience"  we see it as a very ugly and disturbing incident that ruined many hours of our time and cast a pall over the rest of our vacation
0,friends & i all purchased groupons  for the pittsburgh improv on or around march 22nd 2012 at that time only a few big name comedians were listed on the improv's website as special events you can use the groupon on anything that isn't a special event that seemd reasonable the day the groupons were purchased my friend katrina called & reserved two tickets to jim jeffries for 330 at 10pm they allowed her to use her groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything shortly after they changed many of the comedians on their website including jim jeffries to special events when i called i was told i could not use my groupon the same thing happened to many of my friends it's a classic bait & switch these comedians were not special events until after the groupon came out in addition other restrictions such not being able to use the groupons on saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show were not listed under the restrictions when the groupon was for sale so tonight my friends & i had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our groupons but i walked over to the will call window with my friend katrina so she could at least get her tickets big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers they wouldn't give her the tickets it's an absolute joke of a deal how is everyone going to use their groupons by sept if all of the shows are special events now in addition no one at the improv answers the phones or responds to emails my friends & i (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through groupon andor our credit card companies & we are all reporting the improv to the better business bureau etc the pittsburgh improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers
0,isn't often that my wife and i get to go out but we had tickets to see the wonderful lisa landry and figured since we were going to the improv we may as well eat there too i should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision we had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv we were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door there was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either she wanted our order but as we were looking around the place we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us when asked about another menu our waitress told us if we give her our drink order she'll see what she can do the table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with our drinks came we finally put our orders inand that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes when she finally came back all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks after 30 minutes i was finally going to get a second beer "what about our food" we asked "oh" was her answer now according to the menu dinner came with a side salad a complimentary glass of champagne and a chocolate mousse dessert that's all good and fine after a couple of minutes someone not our waitress finally brought out our meals when we asked him about our salads his reply was "do you want me to take your food back" really "do you want me to take your food back" after almost 45 minutes at this point we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food no i don't want you to take our food back halfway through eating our meals which were by this time cold our waitress finally came back with our second beers she asked us how everything was we asked about our salads she said she was told we didn't want them really is this a joke is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on sadly no the service didn't get any better the food was lousy thankfully the standup was great lisa lisa and matt all put on a hilarious show will i ever go back don't know it took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there thanks to traffic i do know that if we do it again we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else the two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks in case you're interested i am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars so yes i do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be even on valentine's day
0,a rip off went as part of the madison comedy festival to see margaret cho  paid extra for vip tix and still had to wait in line when seated told we had to sit back to front so i would be unable to talk or sit next to my friend when we moved to sit side by side we were told we could not we were then moved out of vip seating even though i paid extra and was told i was the only person to have a problem sitting as i was told think that you buy a ticket to a show you're done wrong you still have to comply with a 2 drink minimum will avoid this place at all costs in the future the actual show went great just the management needs work
0,paid a visit to the comedy spot a few weeks ago on the saturday night of my friend gabi's bachelorette weekend (see review below)  i'm with gabs as i also thought this would be the perfect activity post-dinner for our group i think we are all seriously mistaken i also agree with gabi that it was a bit of a buzz killliterally for the most part the comedians who performed sucked expect for one girl duo called carlie and doni the rocked so funnyby the way the drinks were disgusting and we got yelled at for being to loud it was as cold as a meat locker inside and once again except for carlie and doni the comedians absolutely suckedi enjoyed carlie and doni's performance they sang a few off songs about funny life expereinces like a bikini waxing warning do your homework before stepping inside make sur eyou know the comedians on the line up and try to sneak in your own drinks :)
0,was i disappointed  we paid over the net and they had no listing when we arrived  got a table ordered drinks only to be told we had to move because they had a party of 15  several other couples were treated just as we were  we got there 50 minutes early to get a good table then we had to  move  try watching a stand up act that you need to stand up to see it  the table service was good  first  3 acts was like high school entertainment  the pics you see here are nothing like the place  one room packed so tight you could not move classic case of squeeze the cash out of you  never again  this is one of the most memorable birthdays i've spent  scottsdale should wake up  too much nice entertainment around for your dollars than this place  totally disappointed  when we called before the show to confirm everything is set it turns out there is not a live person to be found  leave a message the person at the door managing  turns out he is one of the acts  can't believe they stay in business  had we been treated with repect it may have been an ok night  my cash will be spent in other parts of phoenix from now onon a positive note the marriot a few blocks away was fantastic
0,is a very dumpy club some closets the bar area and the men's room might be bigger i would call it intimate but it has no intimacy it is like an afterthought they have one bathroom with one toilet each for men and women - that must be a code violation it was like seeing a show in your buddies garage and a bad show at that on this night i donated 10 bucks to watch bob howard and friends which was actually some old lawyer moonlighting as a comedian the rest of bob's friends were old and older and i did not manage to laugh once except at the dude who was wearing a fishing hat that bob newhart probably owned that same moron would not accept my two buck off coupon at the door claiming it was a special night a bunch of amateur comedians at a 6pm show does not sound too special to me out of respect for a date i had to wait until after the show to heckle this guy his whole 15 minute act was asking the front row of people what they did and making fun of them an act of a child i felt much better when i heckled him in the hallway asking him if he knew any jokes and he had no response the two drink minimum is not mentioned until you sit in your seat and on this night the waitress overcharged me for a beer on special she lost out on a tip poor staff poor comedy poor venue - go to a real comedy club unless you are a good heckler because you might be star of the show at that point
0,the faq section   it contains crucial information that if you don't have you could just lose out on the money you paid for ticketsno idea how there aren't more terrible reviews based upon the issue i had as well as the terriblenolack of customer servicehere's what happened to me i know it's long but it explains exactly the type of customer service and the type of shady business this place is:a buddy of mine was opening for some lady i've never heard of i didn't care about the main act but figured for $12 a ticket i could sit through whatever came after his opening act rightbought tickets the week before so i would be sure to have a ticket for the 8 pm show this meant an additional $1 per ticket but i figured that was worth it to guarantee a seat day of i had to work until 4 and again at 8 am so i decided 8 pm would be better than 10 ended up at work late got home showered go ready and hauled ass to the club which was about 30 minutes away got there at about 7:57 but the parking lot was full so we drove to a nearby parking area and walked over as we were walking a couple was walking away and said kind of angrily "they're all sold out for this show" my boyfriend said "thanks but she already bought tickets" the woman replied "yeahso did we"confused we approached the doorman printed receiptticket in hand he informed us that they were sold out me: riiiiiightbut we have tickets doorman: sorry you can either come back for the 10 pm show or email them for a refundmeanwhile the woman who warned us and her date came back over to ask more questions we were all very confused about how buying tickets to a show doesn't mean that you have seats at that show the doorman explained with the manager or owner or whoever the chubby old guy is standing right there that they recommend that you come a half hour before the show and get in line anyone in the front of the line with tickets at that time will get in then they'll sell any remaining tickets to people in line who didn't pre-purchase ticketssothere is really no point in purchasing tickets before showing up because it makes no difference as to whether you get into the show if people with no tickets show up before you and buy your seats you're just out the moneybecause i had to work the next morning i opted not to attend the 10 pm show i verified with the doorman that i could email for a refund and he said yes i told him the info regarding this reselling already purchased tickets should be on the receipt or should be made known to you he informed me that "it's on the website"on the way home my boyfriend got on the website and tried to find it he eventually did15 minutes later buried in the faqs i think that's bs why would i read all the faqs if i didn't have any reason to a warning that they can sell your tickets to someone who shows up at the door before you should be more obvious and should be volunteered to you before you agree to purchase anythingin the faq section we also found the warning that sales are final and no refunds will be given at any time since the doorman had clearly told us multiple times that we could email for a refund i wasn't sure what to believe at this point soi called the club phone number i figured if that were true maybe we should turn back and try and make the 10 pm show i got their voicemail and just left my name and number and requested a call back i didn't even say why i was calling and they still never called back not that night not the next day not monday morning not ever the next day i emailed the club for my refund just as the door guy said againno response whatsoever my next step was filing a complaint with paypal who immediately escalated it eventually they informed me that they gave the club so many days (i believe it was10 days maybe) to respond to several requests by paypal to address my issue they never responded (shocker) so paypal refunded my money luckily i was protected by paypal and would've been protected by my credit card company as well however if it hadn't been for that i would have been out $26 for a show i never saw i don't know if most people read the faq section for every restaurant venue theater stadium etc they attend but i don't i probably will now but i still think it's shady when you buy tickets to a movie baseball game concert etcthose tickets are yours  whether you show up early on time or even late i didn't know there was any place that buying tickets didn't guarantee you a seat
0,love thier overpriced drinks they force you to purchase 2 drink minimumreally i dont drink so i was forced to purchase water i spend money on the tickets yet i am forced to purchase 2 waters and on top of that they automatically add in 18% tip for a waiter that took forever to even bring me my water i think not and they are now owned by stand up liveso i guess i will be avoiding both places until they get their "act" together
0,service only reason they got 1 star is because i cant go lowermy sister and i came to the tempe improv for the first time sense its remodel we came to see ralphie may on a wednesday night the whole area was packed full of guest we chose to sit on the end of the half booth half table many servers would come by and ask if we had more in our party so they could sit another couple in the seats we did not however every time they would put a couple in those seats the server would suggest they move because it was right in the walk way and people would be stepping on them the while time or the people would ask to be moved because of the same reason right before the show began we had a couple that sat in front of us only because they were the last seats available we ordered our drinks and food at the same time it took the server a bit to come over but we were fine just hanging out once we ordered after he tried up-selling absolutely everything we waited and waited and waited we watched three tables who ordered after us get their food and drinks before we even got our drinks the manager must have noticed my frustration written all over my face because he came over and asked if we had ordered i said "yes we did about a half hour ago" he apologized and we had our drinks about 10 minutes later during the waiting of our food a server with a full tray of beverages spilled them all on the couple behind us the customers were good sports and let it go the ice tea my sister ordered tasted absolutely terrible however it didn't much matter because i spilled it on her anyway we tried maintaining the mess while servers walked by and and saw the mess yet did nothing i finally got up and interrupted a server entering items into a register and said we have had a spill i need napkins she didn't even look at me and said their are napkins right there they were the small cocktail napkins your drink goes on so i took the whole stack that got her attention we cleaned up the mess ourselves and still waited on our food the horrible food finally came out and then the lights shut off for the show to start i would say it is very difficult to eat in the dark but after a few bites i was done the show started late so it went into the evening later then planned i have heard ralphie doesn't always stop when he is supposed to (which can be great) but it was time for us to get out of there we asked our server for our check and he said he couldn't check us out in there that we had to step into the lobby area it didn't make any sense but walked away without more explanation i tried to explain to my sister what he said but she was just as confused as i we went ahead and got up and went into the lobby where there was not where for us to pay at all the server finally came out and asked where we were going i told him i said we needed our check so we could leave he brought us the check wrong over $35 of the bill was not ours i gave him my card and it took him forever but luckily got it fixed and as far as i know didn't charge me incorrect by far this has been the worst experience i have had at the tempe improv may the remodle wasnt the best idea
0,never fair to judge a club by the comedians on a wednesday night too bad it would have earned a better rating because the actual show was great arrived with 4 friends and picked up our tickets no issues we were seated right up front and our original server quickly greeted us brought us menus and told us about the special drinks for the evening; one of which was a mojito one of my friends ordered the mojito and about 5 min later our server returned to tell us that they were out of mint she was a good sport and just ordered something else but you would think that the servers would have been informed if one of the specials was unavailable my white wine was served warm gross all of us ordered food 2 of us got the buffalo chicken sliders one of us requested no blue cheese after our food came i thought they had mistakenly brought both orders plain so i asked for a side of ranch i later found a small drop of blue cheese on mine even though it wasn't enough to be noticed around this time our original awesome server came over to tell us that he was cut for the night and introduce us to server 2 who quickly wanted to know what our second drink choice would be one of my friends asked if food doesn't count as one of the items as she was the one driving no it doesn't which to me it a horrible policy especially if that policy is not made known when the check came i noticed that i had been charged $150 for ranch i wouldn't have needed the ranch if my food was presented as it was advertised the only thing we ordered that was actually good was the $8 side of sweet potato fries i'm sure i'll be back because i enjoy comedy but next time it will be 2 whatever-is-cheapest drinks and we'll go out to dinner elsewhere
0,a novel idea: open a comedy club with food that doesn't come from the freezer section of costco  anyone  anyone  bueller  i had high hopes for the "new and improved" tempe improv  i love love love stand-up comedy but always found it hard to justify what is bound to be a rather expensive evening  unfortunately the new policies have made it that much harder  they automatically add an 18% gratuity to every check  had our service not been terrible i wouldn't have minded this nearly as much  our waitress was nice but it took absolutely forever to get anything  we asked for water when we were seated (which was 45 minutes before the start time of the show) and didn't actually receive water until halfway through the show  long before this though two in our party physically walked up to the bar and brought back waters for the table  they've changed the "two item minimum" to a "two drink minimum" thus making the entire experience even rape-ier  the menu looks very much the same as the old menu  the food quality is overall poor  my husband's quesadilla was tiny  it looked like a child's plate  my buffalo chicken salad was mostly lettuce and the chicken had possibly been hot the day before  it had clearly been around a while  it wasn't even warm and was tough to cut  the pretzel appetizer was okay but i am spoiled for pretzels thanks to claim jumper and arrogant butcher  these were slightly better than the super pretzels you bake at home the drink situation is highway robbery prison sex and food poisoning all at the same time  my friend and i ordered standard cosmos  they arrived and my glass was nowhere near full and it tasted like cherry koolaid  they were so bad we asked to send them back and get something else  the waitress accommodated us (which was nice) and the drinks sat on our table  upon reviewing the check she did take off the cosmo but i noticed that it was $11 plus a $2 upgrade for smirnoff  smirnoff  are you kidding  she even asked us if we wanted to upgrade vodka and we said no  smirnoff being an upgrade still boggles my mind  what do you get without an upgrade  harry's toilet vodka  we all tried each other's drinks and everything was weak and watered down  the one thing they've done right is rearrange the club so there is less seating and you are not accidentally creating a child with your neighbor  admittedly it was nice not to be so crammed in  despite these issues we enjoyed the comic immensely (we saw michael mcdonald)  as i said earlier i love stand-up but the current practices at the improv are going to make it very difficult for me to come back
0,recently visited the tempe improv a couple of weeks ago to see michael mcdonald  i was looking forward to seeing the changes made to the "new" improv but was incredibly disappointed mostly with the servicei truly enjoy getting out to a comedy show  there's nothing more entertaining than a night out with friends laughing  makes for an amazing time  i absolutely loved michael mcdonald and his opening act  the comedy that night was fantasticbut that was where it ended  it started with our server who didn't even bring us water until at least halfway through the show  a friend and i had to go up to the bar ourselves in order to get water for our table of 6  i understand that it's hectic with all the tables being sat practically at once but an establishment like this should be prepared and expect that sort of thing  it is not ok to keep your paying customers waiting extensive amounts of time for anything especially water  as part of your 2 drink requirement i would highly recommend that you get either beer or wine  you'll get the most for your money from either of those options  their mixed drinks are not even worth mentioning  a friend and i ordered a cosmo  how can you go wrong with a cosmo right  wellthey successfully did  it tasted like punch and not even good punch with absolutely no alcohol  i had asked our server how much the cosmo was because there were no prices on the menu and she had told me they were $11   i was a little shocked to see a tiny martini glass not even full come out knowing that i was going to have to pay $11 for this  she had also asked if i wanted to upgrade which i declined  i noticed on the check that there was an extra $2 charge for an upgrade to smirnoff  1) how is smirnoff an upgrade 2) i said i didn't want an upgrade and 3) the fact that you're charging that ridiculous amount for a drink that didn't taste good and had no trace of alcohol in it is absolutely absurd  the only good thing our server did was allow us to trade our drinks and order something new  i ordered a long island which was ok but nothing close to what a long island should taste like  it was a whole lot better than the ridiculous attempt at a cosmo though  i realize that these sort of outings are already going to be overpriced but i don't expect to get such poor service  out of my group of 6 there was really only 1 meal that was enjoyed which were the nachos  everything else was maybe adequate at the best  i don't expect gourmet food at the improve but i expect edible and decent food since i am paying the overly priced rates  the final straw that threw me overboard was the fact that each check was automatically charged 18% gratuity  i used to be a server so i normally tip about 20% for good service  we didn't receive anything close to good service and to be forced to pay 18% in gratuity (which means it should be left up to me on how much i want to give) is ridiculous  the good servers at this establishment are missing out on at extra 2% and the customers are being ripped off for being required to tip a bad server way too much  my experience at the "new" tempe improv was definitely less than desirable  like i said before the comedy was the only good factor  it makes it hard to want to go back when there are so many other options in town  i will definitely have to rethink my decision to return and will do only for a comedian worthwhile  if i do return i will be eating dinner somewhere else and only be ordering the required 2 drink minimum
0,had been here a couple years ago and it was a pretty good experience but then i came here again recently for a miranda sings concert and i was very disappointed can you say rip off the tickets were reasonably priced ($20) but then there was a "two drink minimum" rule i wasn't thirsty do i opted for the cheapest option- i ordered a lemonade which was super nasty so i sent it back and ordered a sprite instead- also very nasty i don't know how they managed to make their simple fountain drinks taste so bad anyway the next time i saw my waitress it was to bring me my check which was $13 i had only drank a couple sips of each of my drinks and that's what they charged so stupid- that's almost the price that i paid for my ticket itself anyway tempe improv should pull out of the food and beverage thing all together and just make stadium-style seating so that everybody can watch the performances a lot easier and not be ripped off and forced to buy gross drinks
0,saw the show with aidy bryant and tim robinson tonight the show was great and wasn't the problem at all let me start by saying that i work in customer service so i know what good customer service looks like and what bad customer service looks like tonight we received awful service from a server we were under the impression that the 2 drink minimum requirement could include beer and soft drinks seeing as how we had already paid about $50 to see the show and it is ridiculous to pay over $10 for one cocktail we figured going the cheaper route would be the way to go once we ordered a coke and  blue moon the server shut us down and gave us the most attitude i have ever received from a server she didn't make eye contact with us she told me the beers she had like it was some kind of chore and she had better places to be she also passed us by several times while we had empty drinks on the table helped the customers around us and pretended like we didn't exist yes we ordered the cheapest drinks we could but the gratuity was included and our bill still came out to $30 for only 3 beers and a soda as outrageous as that is alone i still can't believe the service we received we were paying customers and deserved to be treated as such what if i was in aa and ordered a soda because i couldn't drink alcohol that is unacceptable service and we will not be coming back to this establishment
0,improv previously offered a two "item" minimum  now it is a two "drink" minimum  i guess they figure people will eat anyway so we'll just get more money out of them by making them get two drinks to go with the food  their drinks are so overpriced even for a comedy club  $575 for an iced tea is absurd  their specialty mixed drinks are $1495 and are in an approximately 13 oz hurricane glass that is more ice and mix than alcohol  we were seated to the right of the stage and could not hear the show until after the fourth attempt of letting somebody know our entire table was unable to hear the show (party of 7)  the group next to us were taking pictures (even though it's not allowed) and talking the entire time  we asked them to keep it down  they got confrontational  the club did not ask them to keep it down or ask them to leave  our group spent nearly five hundred dollars on the evening (with tickets) and had a very unpleasant experience  none of us will be returning
0,have to say i came here after 9 years just to see my friend perform and the volume was so low i had to ask more than twice to turn it up so i could hearthen they blame it on the microphonereallypleaseget the volume up so i actually pay attentioni will not be going backbut i will definitely be going to stand up livesucks because i thought u were closed now i realize ur open and due to the poor volume i won't b back
0,my problem with this club; they seem to have an incompetent group of teenagers running this place the girls at will call seem very confused the staff inside is aloof i went there with a group of friends to see chris delia 4 tickets and only 3 of us were there as we were waiting on the 4th to arrive the girl at the door told us we would have to wait for our 4th person to show up for our entire party to be seated then she proceeded to make jokes that were completely lost on us she giggled and cackled the whole time almost seeming as though she was directly making fun of our situation which we didn't find funny since we arrived early for good seats we waited for a couple minutes and were greeted by a server who showed us to our table even though our 4th was still not there she informed us it was fine and we could wait inside at our table for her which was cool i don't understand why that's such a big deal anyway the servers there deserve to be paid more they hustle and are very friendly and efficient this club needs to find a new staff to handle the tickets one of my least favorite comedy clubs for this reason once the laugh factory opens in scottsdale i'll take my business there hopefully they'll employ people who actually know what they're doing
0,show may have been funny four years ago which is when my husband first saw it and why he recommended we see it on our recent vegas trip but the show must have changed drastically - first off it's no longer improv but just rehearsed bad skits (think today's snl skitsnow think ten times worse than that) the actors are good but the script is just not funny at all i think the only people that laughed during the performance were a group of college kids that looked drunkhigh and guffawed at anything we were not the only disappointed faces in the room and we heard a guy exit and tell some people in line for the next showing that they shouldn't waste their time and just eat the cost of tickets and go gamble we paid full price for these tickets so we were even more disappointed avoid this show at all costs
0,show was definitely not what we are used to for comedythe reasoncomedy was absentif you are looking for stand-up comedy improvisational or not this is not the place this is a comedy troupe (being generous on the word comedy here) there are no tables just rows of chairsbut that is because there is no drink service this is more geared to the 12 - 20 crowd with sodas and candy bars for sale and simply some place to hang out on a saturday nightand this was the "late" show really wish we could get back that 90 minutes of lifebut it is gone forever the place was full (largely 12 - 25 crowd so someone likes itbut we will not be back
0,used a groupon on a saturday night  there was no problem redeeming the groupon for two vip tickets  a line began forming at 9:15pm  at 9:45pm they took vip ticket holders out of the line and escorted us upstairs to the venuethere were no tables for our drinks and the chairs were very uncomfortable  behind the make-shift stage were windows overlooking the strip  the flashing light coming from giant signage was very distracting  all three performers were terribly unfunny  they all seemed to be 'phoning it in' and didn't really seem to be interested in making us laugh  at times the bellagio fountains (which we could easily see behind the performers) were more interesting than the comediansthe show started at 10:20 and ended at 11:20  exactly one hour  the whole event was very amateurish  we will not be back and will not recommend the show to our friends
0,venue and the comics were not funny the last 2 comedy clubs i've done in vegas have been very disappointing the other being the improv the best time at one of these i ever had was at the comedy stop at the trop but that one is no more it's really a good thing my friend got us all in for free on a locals ticket otherwise i would have been even more disappointedif you're not careful you will spill your drinks as the only place they had for them was a cup holder on the back of the chair in front of you this is another vegas venue where they just make you feel like herded cattlei have decided after this dismal display that i will no longer be doing comedy clubs unless they have a nationally known headliner and i know i'm going to laugh so hard that i can't laugh anymore i can get just as many good laughs from a bad comedy movie
0,husband and i decided to check this out and purchased discount tickets on the strip  even at half off i feel like we threw our money away  the comedians were amateur at best and this includes the headliner  jokes were not only crude but nasty and several people walked out during the show the drinks were overpriced and the "all you can drink" option for $25 was not a good deal  cheap wine well drinks and domestic beer  my advice save your money and buy tickets to a genuine comedy act
0,ask people to bring their "vip" tickets at 8:15pm if you're not going to let anyone in until after 9pmla comedy club wasn't on the directory so we had to ask several employees where the club was we purchased groupons that said to bring your vip ticket between 8:15-9:00 we arrived at 8:20 and there were no employees anywhere and the club was closed there was a make shift line of random customers with the same confusion we left and came back at 8:45 there at least was now an employee who told us that it didn't open for another 20 minutes we went to go lean against the wall to wait and found out if we hadn't left we would have been first in line as that was where the line started about 7 people had filled in so we weren't that far back but i the employee did her job with information we could have been firstthe groupon said front row we asked to be sat in the front row - we were sat two rows back - even though there were no people in the front row yet - when that row was occupied it was because they were seated well after we were the row we were in did not have tables or anything to lean on - only every other row had tables definitely not vip seatsi would not recommend this cluster-f of a "comedy club" nor will i come back**********update***********i left the original review during the 45 minute wait for the show to start after the show i was accosted by the host who sat me he apologized for not hearing me ask for the front row then asked me to prove to him that groupon listed front row seating because it didn't say it anywhere on the paper he did this in front of everyone leaving - i was horrified it was like he had zero customer service experience ever so i pulled up the groupon page on my phone (something he could have done himself after reading my review) and showed him he physically took my phone out of my hands to show it to the owner - again like he couldn't just pull up the page himself later the owner looked like he couldn't care less the host had told me he wanted to resolve the issue i guess in his mind it was resolved - now that i proved i wasn't lying and sent me on my way with an apology if i could give a zero star review i would now instead of never going back i'm going to tell everyone about my shitty experience and make sure no-one else has to waste their money on la comedy club
0,paid for vip seating for the show  what a waste of money  there was no distinction between general seating and vip seating  some people in front of us has tables but we did not  at the least we should have had a table on which to set our drinks  the show was fine but do not waste your money to upgrade to vip  i complained the next day to the box office sales booth at bally's but they could have cared less
0,puh-leaze  the good reviews must be written about excellent headliners or by shills  got supposedly "free" tickets that cost the three of us $40  they included one watered down drink each  yes even my bottled water (that is clearly labeled $4) cost $1050 plus a $250 upcharge plus tax plus whatever else it took to get to the $40  the mc was horrible and i never heard so many genitalia jokes in a 60 minute period before from three different comics  if you go take lots of money and buy lots of drinks because the only people laughing were drunk drunk drunk  the venue is very mediocre and as might be expected in vegas you have to walk through the casino to get to it  showtickets4locals sure was a rip off on this occasion  never used them before and never will again
0,yay yay  i know why you're reading this review  like me you didn't score tickets for a "good" show and are thinking about spending $25 so the night isn't wasted  right i know it happened to me tooeven if you're offered free tickets do not be tempted  this guy sucks royally entertainer isn't the right word for this 4th class hackpeople please listen to me  i promise i will not steer you wrongthis is the worst performer i have ever had the displeasure of seeing  he stinks  not funny not talented  it was the most miserable 45 minutes i'd ever spent  to include a divorce a motorcycle accident and a root canalthree friends and i agonized over leaving in the middle of the show but in the end just had to  his "entertainment" bordered on embarrassing  like an untalented william hung gb can't sing can't dance can't tell jokesall of his impersonations sound like the same guy--him  try watching gordie brown do michael jackson  it was painfully like gordie brown doing gordie brownit's too bad too  he seems like a nice guy  he's just not talented at alldo yourselves a favor and steer clear of this losing show
0,a doubt the absolute worst vegas showcomedian i have ever witnessed  went to the show hearing that he is so fantastic like many of these reviews but oh what a surprise seriously not sure how he is employedwithin the first 3- 5minutes of the show i wasn't sure if his crappy impressions were a real attempt at humor or a bad andy kauffman like impression put-on  after 5 minutes it didn't get better and i was torn between being  embarrassed for him or completely ticked that i actually paid to see the performance  his shiny white teeth contrasted nicely with his dark shirt with a hole in the armpitnice touch gordy not funny best joke of the night was him jokingly tellingthanking the weekend audience (90% over 50) that it was his 3162 consecutive sellout to a clearly at best half empty room  he blamed it on a fictitious foreign tour bus driver that must have mistakenly taken the rest of the crowd to the wrong hotelthe silver nugget instead of the golden nugget (rim-shot here) oh god help mei am being serious here when i write all thisi've heard better song impressions at the local karaoke bar and better joke telling in a 5th grade talent show really  not joking  as for being current jokes about tatoo from fantasy islandreally  the show has been off the air for 28 years and the actor who played "tatoo" has been dead for 19 years  jokes about sammy davis with 1 eyei get it he sees with one eye not 2  sammy had a fake eye so he looks funny  then we get into impressions from the blockbuster film we all know and love on golden pondoh wait that was 31 years ago  when do we get to see gordy do "the fonz" aaaaaaeeeeei got up and left to take a leak during the set with hopes that he would try to embarrass me and ask where i was going  funny thing is i wanted him too as i was ready with the comment have you seen your show the only thing worse than the act is the overdone photoshop work on his marquee out front  pretty scary when you are an introvert and want take on a seasoned comedian but nothing about his act was witty fun or entertaining i was with a big group and so i did come back for moreclosest edgy part is when he did a crappy deep mexican accent (could have been the frito bandito as far as i could tell) claiming it was antonio banderes (of course he needed to tell you who he was doing in his accent firstand how relevant is antonio these days anyway)  mentioned antonio did the animated movie puss and boots as it was his 2 favorite things boots and  pause(rimshot here)  is that funny to you and am i missing somethingif you are 65-100 maybe this thing is for you but for me (45) this was a impressioncomedy suck fest at its finest i wouldn't go again for free even if they served beer and washed my car in the parking garagereally  honestly gordy contact me and i'll be glad to get my refund  you seem like a nice man but i left the show feeling like i lost an hour+ of my life and $100 over nothing more than a crappy pt barnum sideshow  a sucker is born every minute and i left feeling like one  person with me walked out and said they needed a drink to recover from the awful performance we both left feeling 100% ripped off not in a happy moodmy advice look up his act online on youtube and if that works for you enjoy if not be warned  best part of the night was the golden nugget casino that was surprisingly very nice inside for an old-town vegas casino
0,telling the truth im 50 years old    saw show last september 2011  it was the worst they were acting like they were taping show asking people to be load and laugh sound system was bad   ive been to a lot of shows in vegas and this and the caveman show are 2 of the worst had to walk out on gordie  45 min into hes show after he made a tasteless  911 jokedont waste time even if your comp tickets
0,of all can the gordie's picture be a little more updated please you have seen it on fliers billboard and in magazines and then you go see the show and you wonder if you're in the right theater i mean the guy doesn't even look anything like in the adsanyways now the review about the show i went to the show with my sister and we were probably the youngest ones there except for the 21st birthday girl who got a b-day shout out in middle of the show so from there on i knew we are going to hear bunch of corny and out dated jokes he was impersonating a bunch of older singers and bands and all of sudden eminem comes out of no where i was laughing only because it was so ridiculous and then george w bush jokes start to surface throughout half of the show i mean really enough with the bush jokes already we get it other comedians have all used the same punch lines and ridicules lets just move onin the end i really wanted to leave early but we were sitting in the front and i feel really bad walking out of the show gordie has a awesome and powerful voice very charismatic on the stage but his jokes and impersonations are just dull and out of date i cannot connect with the guy but i do see a lot of baby boomers where laughing their asses off the show is not for me
0,worst show in las vegas  and i am a very lenient guy  my wife and i are early 30's las vegas residents and we average 2-3 shows a week1)  his humor is awful simply awful  my wife and i kept looking at each other like "why are people laughing"  we had seats 4 rows from the very back the number of people "sneaking out" (aka walking out) was unbelievable never seen such an exodus from a show2)  he rewrites song lyrics with "toilet humor for republicans" (as my lovely wife put it)  somehow bashing gays blacks and pot smokers got the absolute most laughs  we were in the back we saw you people giving him a standing ovation3)  you have to be drunk and on vacation as we saw most people coming in with sunburns and cocktails4)  and as some have already pointed out his picture must be from the 80's because he looks older than my parentssave your money for anything else  now that's advice from a local  i was literally inspired to create a yelp account after his shenanigans
0,girlfriend and i got the tickets for free thank godcuz less than 10mins into show i wanted to leaveit was just not my type of show im in my 30s and i knew all the songs n people he was making fun at but it wasnt really funny yet the older people i would say 50-100 yrs old where having a good time i wasntloli give him credit for working up a sweat i wouldnt see him even if tickets where free again
0,wife and i are late 30s-early 40s and did not find him particularly funny nor talented  we went for free on fillaseatcom and ended up leaving about 30 minutes in  sure there were a few funny bits but overall his impersonations were not very good and his jokes were not very funny  skip this one
0,wife and i caught this show at the golden nugget and had heard good things about him in the media so we were pretty excited to see him 3 minutes into the show we were staring at each other in disbelief absolutely the corniest sense of humor i've ever had the misfortune of seeing on a stage his impressions are often dated and usually inaccurate if he hadn't announced some of them prior to performing them i would have been at a loss for who he was mimicking a half hour into the show we were waiting for him to turn his back on the crowd for a moment so we could run out of the theater and put an end to our suffering i do acknowledge that some people in the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves but i have no idea who his audience is maybe people who thought "mama's family" was the funniest show ever i've heard people compare him to danny gans but as far as i'm concerned there's no comparison gans was much more entertaining his impressions were much more spot-on and although i didn't find him the funniest guy in the world he was richard pryor compared to mr brown i would certainly recommend a trip to frank caliendo's show if you're looking for an impressionist if you find yourself at the golden nugget go stare at their aquarium rather than watch this showit's more entertaining and they have a pufferfish that does a better nicholson than brown does
0,was the dumbest show we have ever seen  we never laughed once and after 15 minutes we realized we would have 2 more hours of the same boring stupidity  we're not sure what some of the other reviewers here saw but there were many people around us who were bored too and never clapped  music was extremely loud and theater seating is on level ground and you are looking over the heads in front of you  save your money and don't go  he used to be on the strip but has been demoted to golden nugget downtown  we went to see carrot top at the luxor on the strip  omg  now carrot top is a show  we laughed our heads off  put your money on carrot top's show and go to that
