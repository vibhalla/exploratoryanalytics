Game 7 was tied at 89 with four minutes remaining. At that point, the Cavaliers and Warriors had combined to score the same exact amount of points in the series. What makes this so interesting is that none of the first six games were decided by less than 10 points.
The entire NBA world was privy to that one close game. A game that was for all the marbles. And it was an epic performance from both squads, fighting tooth and nail to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy when all was said and done.
Some will point to the Los Angeles Lakers' Game 7 win over the Boston Celtics back in 2010 or the Lakers’ win over Detroit back in 1988 as the two-best Finals series in modern history. Well, an argument could be made for both.
Though, with what was on the line in this specific series, it’s hard to look at another Finals bout that was better for the sport. Potential dynasty going up against the legacy of one of the best players in Association history.
In the end, Cleveland came out on top. But we’d be remiss not to mention just how hard the Warriors fought from the first game of the season with expectations at a record high. Chasing history, the Warriors ended up falling to greatness. There’s no shame in that.
