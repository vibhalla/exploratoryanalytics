### Summary
The paper talks about the large networks being scale free i.e. retaining the basic topology irrespective of the new nodes being added or removed. The authors Barbasi and Albert, propose and prove the theory that the networks are scale free by the virtue of the following two properties which were not taken into consideration by the existing theories(ER) used to define Network Topology:
##### Non Static networks 
    There are vertices being added and removed continuously
##### Preferential Association 
    The new nodes do not attach to existing nodes with the same probability

The authors go on to present that preferential association is a phenomenon as newly attached vertices tend to associate with the vertices that already have larger number of edges for e.g. a new airline is most likely to start flights connecting to larger, busier airports from smaller airports than flying between two smaller airports, in turn adding to the traffic of the busier airport.

The authors also show that how a node added earlier than another node is likely to scale more with time due to the preferential association phenomenon.


### Questions and Answers

##### What is a scale-free network?
A scale free network is a network that maintains the same topological features irrespective of new nodes joining or existing nodes being dropped. The overall topology remains the same. In a scale free network the association of vertices follows a power law distribution.

##### What are the main differences between the scale-free network and the random graph model of Erdoes and Renyi (ER)?
The ER model assumes that the number of nodes (N) is fixed in a network and that the nodes have the same probability to attach to the other nodes. In contrast the scale free network model assumes that the networks are continuously adding and dropping nodes and the phenomenon of preferential association exists in the real life complex large networks.

##### What strikes you the most about this paper?
This paper resonates most with me due to the fact that the authors have kept the explanation very simple, non mathematical. They have taken examples that anyone can relate to and understand, to explain their theory. 

##### Which aspects did you find obscure or not accessible?
I do not have the understanding of the power law, the calculation where it is used to calculate the exponent 'gamma' was difficult for me to understand.
